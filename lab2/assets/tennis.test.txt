M	That last set seemed like a faultless performance. Is that the way you saw it?
M	Did playing the semifinal, finishing that off first, help you going into the second match in the afternoon?
M	Is that difficult mentally as much as physically to switch on and switch off and switch back on again?
M	You said on TV I think you said you felt better than when you won Wimbledon in 2013. Just wondered if you could sort of quantify where you think the improvements are.
M	The last time that you won this tournament you went on to win Wimbledon.
M	You seemed to go up a gear after losing the first set to Muller and then maintained that level to get better and better all the way through. Was that situation with Muller what you needed to really sort of jump charge you?
M	I'm trying to work out what Jonas' record is now when he's with you at tournaments. Did he do one match with you in Madrid?
M	100, I think. 10 matches?
M	Has Jonas' voice been the lone voice in your ear, or have you been speaking with Amlie on the phone this week?
M	Do you get into any sort of routine now that this is over and you start your preparation, training preparation for Wimbledon? Do you get into a routine? And if you do, are you a creature of habit and have to stick with that, superstitions of yes or no? How do you plan things ahead now?
M	Lleyton's last Wimbledon is coming up. When he won Wimbledon he also won the US Open. A lot of people in Australia thought he might win a couple more. I was wondering how he might be remembered and where he ranks?
M	Some players do quite a lot of sponsorship stuff in the week before slams. You tend not to. Your deal with Seedrs, what are you looking to get out of that? Is that the kind of deal you prefer to do now so you have an input rather than just wearing a patch and having to look after sponsors' interests and things like that?
M	What are you looking to get out of that, that deal, apart from money?
M	You have been beaten by one player three times. What is your feeling about that?
M	I'm not asking you to criticize Novak's preparation, but would you be comfortable going into Wimbledon without any grass court tournament under your feet?
M	Was there anything different from your perspective this year with this event being a 500 rather than a 250?
M	Do you have any message for the men that invented tiebreaks?
M	He had 22 aces past you under two hours. Must be a bit of an ordeal?
M	He's got a good recent record against you. Why do you think that is? Is it the serve in particular?
M	How big were your hopes of doing really well here, having just come from Roland Garros?
M	I know after the French obviously you said there is still a gap between where you thinkyou sort of don't belong in the Big 4. When Kevin was in here he says he's thinking what you did the last year and a half you deserve to be one of the best in the world. Maybe the time to hear that isn't when he has just beaten you, but is it nice that people are at least putting you in that bracket of caliber of opponent?
M	Do you think it's not something you could do to get to that level or obviously...
M	In terms of Wimbledon preparations, what will you do now?
M	Are you going to stay in London or go back to Switzerland?
M	You always say you don't go into a Grand Slam expecting to win. Who do you think of the others would you see as the favorites to win Wimbledon this year?
M	In that order?
M	You just played your doubles match with Dimitrov. What's your relationship with Grigor like?
M	What do you think are his strengths?
M	His strengths. What is he very good at?
M	That sums it up?
M	You won two of the four slam titles. Does that mean you view Wimbledon a little differently?
M	Do you still view grass as the most difficult surface?
M	Your Wimbledon, your favorites, what leads you to that order?
M	Just interested.
M	Can you identify similarities to your performance today compared to last times playing Kevin and what do you see differently?
M	You lost to him four times. Talk about your record against him.
M	Is there anything you're going to do to treat yourself? Give yourself a day off, anything in London before Wimbledon?
M	Obviously after winning the first set, what positives can you take from this match today?
M	Looking ahead, of course, Wimbledon, Davis Cup, what do you take out of this match against such a big server?
M	Are you just not the kind of guy that can drill the somebody like that?
M	I'm just wondering, day one of the tournament, the court is still a bit lush. He suffered that fall at Wimbledon a few years ago, he admits he's still not that confident moving on the grass. Was it a tactic of yours to move him about?
M	Is it even harder than Isner's?
M	Do you think your shirt and socks would go well with Stan's shorts?
M	How are you doing physically? We heard you had a foot issue.
M	What are you doing the next 10 days or so?
M	Kyle is injured just now, but depending on whether he comes back next week or not, do you feel this period is an important time of year for a British player and also a selection period for the Davis Cup tie next month?
M	Obviously it's a 500 tournament now.
M	In terms of the draw, it looks exciting. Is there any down side in that for the players? Because obviously you can be up against a top10 player like that fairly often. No momentum into it, is there?
M	Do you think because it's Wimbledon coming up, do you think the media is very critical of tennis? Do you think it's a fair thing to say?
M	Are you more confident or less confident going into Wimbledon?
F	Having won in Birmingham in 2007, do you believe past winning experience in a tournament is helpful years later in doing well?
F	Do you think this is the toughest Aegon Classic there has been in years?
F	We had a good chat with you yesterday and you explained the background now. Is this now for you business as usual, taking the games, you know, next up Kerber or...
F	Well, yeah. You know, first round, second round, this is the plan.
F	Are you surprised Ana has gone out?
F	What happened?
F	Was this precaution you're taking rather than something that's actually going to threaten you being at Wimbledon this week?
F	Was it something you felt right from the start?
F	Are you feeling pain just in your back low back, is it?
F	You were stretching out your hamstring...
F	Is it particularly when you're serving or...
F	You weren't tempted to fire down bombs and hope she couldn't get them back?
F	Is there anything in the next couple of days that would stop you being there on Monday or Tuesday?
F	Is it something you'd have to nurse through, nurse yourself through next week?
F	I know you treat every match the same, but you have just beaten a top10 player in the world. That's got to feel different, surely.
F	You do appreciate it's pretty rare for a British player to beat top 10s. Doesn't happen every day.
F	But it's true. It's a massive deal.
F	Do you feel in a good place right now, playing some of your best tennis?
F	Did you find yourself getting more nervous or more calm as you got closer to winning?
F	How much more special is it to do it in front of a home crowd and in your hometown?
F	What pleases you most? Is it the win or the manner in which you achieved it?
F	You don't know who you're going to play next, but how far do you think you can go now?
F	Your progression from Nottingham to Birmingham to here, you're right, it's not just about doing well in these three weeks plus Wimbledon on grass, it's how you're going to translate into the rest of the season. You have the hard court swing but a good run here and good run at Wimbledon is going to bounce you up the rankings. How are you going to sort of adjust your mindset now after this kind of profile win?
F	I know you said you take each point as it comes, but are you looking forward to Wimbledon or are you just totally sort of ignoring it?
F	I seem to recall when we first spoke, must be a couple of years now down here, the goal, you were talking about breaking into the top 100. You did that.
F	I think so.
F	PostWimbledon last year you got to 89. So going forward from here, what are you kind of looking at?
M	Congrats. First final since 2013; first time outside of Russia. How does it feel?
M	Seven wins; seven straight sets. That must be a boost for your confidence as well.
M	Two hours against Del Potro in the heat. What did you do between last night and today? Ice bath? Sleep?
M	Final will be late in the afternoon. Will the cooler conditions affect your game at all?
M	You remember going on a run before where you haven't dropped a set for seven matches?
M	Coming off a very good season and now another good week, what are some of the improvements that you've been making?
M	Some of the improvements you've been making?
M	Have you had a look at the Australian Open draw and the way you're sitting in it? Were you thinking about that at all today?
M	I read some of the interviews at Wimbledon when you were asked about your wife, who's your coach. Explain that to people who might think that's a bit strange. Because then if you have an argument you have to go home. You can't go in separate hotel rooms. You're in the same room. How do you do the husband wife and player coach thing?
M	Why has she been such a good coach for you?
M	Did she have a background in coaching before she was working with you?
M	Have you played Viktor much?
M	Win or lose tomorrow, it's ATP world history. Never been a final on the world tour with two qualifiers.
M	No, the whole tour. Obviously in Sydney, but the whole tour. Does it mean something to you to have your name in the record books?
F	Despite the loss you must be pleased with how you stretch Petra and how you hit the ball?
F	After the first set, Jarka, did you think that maybe an upset was in the air?
F	Do the five matches, two in Brisbane and three in Sydney, tell you where you are heading into Melbourne?
F	Did you feel any added pressure knowing you were the only Australian female left?
F	When things started going, you seemed really calm and collected.
F	On the outside.
F	Is that a new Jarka thing?
F	Your coach said he was pleased that you didn't get into frustration, that that's the Jarka from the past.
F	How was your recovery after the late match last night?
F	Thoughts on the match you just played.
F	Is it one of your biggest wins since you won here last year? Flavia is seeded and not far outside the top 10.
F	And you have won 12 matches in a row in Sydney. What's it about this place that brings out your best tennis?
F	Have you spent much time in the city? Done anything fun?
F	You went through qualifying. I was wondering if you applied for a wildcard, and your thoughts on not actually getting one.
F	So was it upsetting for you?
F	Obviously coming through qualifying last year seemed to do quite well for you. Some players like the match practice. Is it sometimes easier coming into the main draw with three wins under your belt or starting fresh in the main draw?
F	Anything in particular you worked on in the offseason? You seem to have a very good backhand.
F	Playing Madison Keys next. How are you feeling about that match?
M	How do you feel? What was it like playing that match?
M	What do you think has been in your game in the last year that's allowed you to play a match this well today?
M	Does that experience of playing those top players, does it translate into more calm in the tighter moments, or is it just about tactics and knowledge and things like that?
M	You said you wanted to give yourself a sense of what can you do differently about these guys or Nadal. What did you do differently?
M	Three match points. What was your feeling on those occasions, mental approach, to each of those? Because looked like you remained pretty calm.
M	On a sort of lighter note it's about to be your oneyear anniversary with the sleeve. Can you reflect on the time you two have spent together and what it's brought to your game?
M	It seems like you always bottled up, no fist pumps or anything. Are you happy, or are you making a conscious effort to bottle up?
M	Can you talk about the processes of playing Roger, especially playing him after a great win today after Rafa? How do you get yourself up and ready to play another legend?
M	What do you think it would say for you and your progress if you can get backtoback wins against players like Roger and Rafa?
M	When you look back on that Brisbane match, what were your big takeaways? It was great match; well competed; you were hitting the ball massively; just came up a bit short. What was the takeaway from it?
M	Everybody was talking about the potential semifinal with the Big 4. Is it nice to upset the apple cart a little bit?
M	These four guys have been sort of represented as being really firm at the top. Do you see them as a group still, sort of a ceiling you have to break through in order to make that next step, or is it all just every man for himself?
M	For a while Rafa was the top player that you liked playing the least. What do you feel today? Is there one player that you like less to play than others, or who do you feel more or less comfortable with?
M	Wondering when he's standing pretty much behind the line judges to return your serve, do you ever think going underhand?
M	It would probably work though.
M	Return of serve. Sometimes he stood way back behind Indian Wells, and other times he moved right up on the baseline. Were you aware he was changing it up on the return position on your serve?
M	Is Nadal the toughest player to play, to face physically? That was a long match on a hot day. Would he be the guy that you would not pick out of the top guys ahead of you to face with length of match and as hot as it was?
M	But the effect on you.
M	When you see players standing that far back against your serve, does it kind of give you confidence that they have to do that? They have to stand behind and they have to, you know, wait and try and get your serve back?
M	You have a great run in the tournament so far. Can you talk about the way you're playing and how you're feeling out here at Indian Wells this year?
M	When you win a first set and you go down 2Love beginning of the second set, is your mindset, I've got to get after him right here? I've got to turn this around right here? Is that the whole important turning point of that match?
M	And when you do that, do you see him let down? You come back 22, 32, do you see him let down mentally? Do you feel it?
M	The conditions were different today than yesterday. How does that affect the way you played?
M	How hard is to your body is to play singles and one hour later return to the court to play doubles?
M	You have always credited yourself on pretty high firstserve percentage. Today your first serve was up 126, 127 miles an hour. Were you trying to get a little bit more?
M	Speaking of him, you've got Raonic next. Your thoughts on his serve and his game?
M	What is your thought on Wayne Odesnik and his 15year suspension?
M	15 years for his second doping violation.
M	Today.
M	Just how that maybe tries to clean up the sport.
M	You're saying two matches today, singles, doubles; tomorrow you've got the day off. What sort of things do you do on your day off?
F	What is her game's biggest challenge? Obviously she's very powerful, consistent, big server. You have beaten here twice now in about a month. What is it about her game you have been able to match up well against?
F	Is that something you had to learn? I remember you said it was  I think it was in Doha or Dubai  where you were saying you need to become a fighter girl.
F	You said that you feel like your game has been improving as this tournament has gone along. What specifically have you seen that's improved?
F	Just in your game in general.
F	Has it been tough having a lot of different coaches in a short time, having a lot of different voices?
F	You have a lot of Romanian fans obviously. Lepchenko match, especially. The amount of support you get all around the world now, how happy does that make you?
F	I see Moldovan flags and flags and Bulgarian flags. Everyone wants a part of you.
F	Getting it done in straight sets. What were you able to get done well today? Lucie is a tough opponent.
F	When the ball is flying on you a lot of players say that's a big challenge at Indian Wells  but when the ball is flying off your racquet and you're having trouble controlling it, what do you do to try and get the control back?
F	This is your third win I believe over a lefthanded player. Is there something about lefties that gets you going or, do you like playing them?
F	So what did you work on in the offseason?
F	When you talk about footwork, you mean the footwork around the ball?
F	Or speed?
F	Did you think about what your goals would be at the start of the season for this season, like what are your targets?
F	The cap? AJ? What's that?
F	What does it stand for, AJ?
F	We won't mention it.
F	I'm curious about when you played Maria in Brisbane the first set didn't go very well for you. Then I think you were down like 41 in the second set, and then you started to like reel off all these games in the end. Is it just because at that point you were was it they were looser? You understand what I'm saying?
F	I saw that you like to drive cars.
F	If you win Stuttgart you can get a Porsche.
F	Did you ever drive one?
F	How fast?
F	You may play Makarova in the next round. The match is not over yet, but it might be another lefty for you. Do you have any comments on that?
F	Have you had any coaching changes in the offseason or are you still working with the same coaches?
M	Was your shoulder all right? Just ordinary? How did it hold up?
M	This was your first time back in a long time. Can you tell me what you have been doing since you last played and how it felt to be back out on court?
M	What exactly is the nature of the injury that put you out? And also, you said that you were still feeling some of the pain in the shoulder on court. Any concern about that? Because as you kind of start playing a little more, is it going to get worse?
M	So it's just typical kind of wear and tear of getting back? Nothing special?
M	It didn't look like you were 100% out there. We know you're playing doubles tomorrow. What's the reason that you're playing with Del Potro if you're not quite there yet?
M	You're coming off the Grand Slam. What kind of mentality do you have coming into the new season? Do you feel you'll have a bull's eye on your back with other players because now you're a Grand Slam champion?
M	How were the conditions out there? Hot? Not hot? It's probably hot.
M	The balls, are they flying? Talk about that.
M	When do you think you will be back in top form? Are you aiming like Wimbledon, or what's your target for playing your best tennis this season?
M	You have had experience where you have been off tour and come back. Does this one feel different? How do you prepare yourself mentally to take off as quickly as possible?
M	What did Goran tell you after the match?
M	When you discussed the injury with your doctors and physios and all that sort of stuff, was there any sense as to whether or not making the trips, doing ITPL during the offseason and all that, that may have pushed back the recovery time? Was there no impact? What was the sense there? Do you regret playing it?
M	When you looked at the draw today and you saw Monaco, the ultimate grinder, did you think, Tough draw?
F	Fairly hot and sweaty night.
F	When you called out Sven on the court in the first set, what were the words there? What you did you need or what did you want to say to him?
F	A turning point?
F	I was thinking in the second set when she was up 40Love and you broke her.
F	What does it mean for the Australian Open? Is this the sort of highquality match you need before a Grand Slam?
F	Two hours 40 minutes against a top 10 player. Is that an indication of how the preseason has gone?
F	Close to No.1? Do you care?
F	What was going through your head after the second set when she took the medical timeout? Same thing happened in Cincinnati.
F	Yeah. Could you please talk a little bit about your coaching with Sven.
F	Can I ask you about your schedule? On your website says you're going to play Fed Cup.
F	It because all the players have to play because Olympics? You have to get your Fed Cup up? Why are you playing Fed Cup basically?
F	Would you like to win a FedCup with Russia? It's one thing you haven't got on your quite extensive CV.
F	You still like the Olympics too, and obviously that's part of what's going on with it, too, right?
F	Talk a little bit about that:
M	Tiebreaks made the difference?
M	Nerves? Pressure? What do you think in the two tiebreakers, why did you make those errors?
M	He got no break points off your serve; I think maybe you got five but only converted one.
M	He's top 10 in the world and you came that close. Do you think about it or overthink now or let it go or analyze and see what you can do better? What?
M	Must be feeling pretty well set up for the summer though.
M	Did you take anything from John Millman's performance last night?
M	Bernie seems to be looking a bit more focused than before. That's the perception. Is that yours?
M	What about Raonic's game? You almost knocked him off today. How do you see him going into the Australian Open and pushing further into that tournament?
M	You yourself your serve is your power weapon, and Raonic has the similar weapon. Are you trying to work him out in a way that you serve?
M	You obviously have the respect of the Top 10 guys. How far can you go?
M	That kind of form you showed, you would be hoping for second, third, fourth round or beyond?
M	What was the hardest thing to deal with about Bernard's game tonight?
M	Did you feel like you worked your way on top in the second half of the first set getting to the tiebreak?
M	Is that one of the big things you learned, that little things like that can change the match?
M	You played a lot of sort of top 20, top 30 players in the past few months. How was his level tonight compared to them?
M	You seemed very selfassured in the tight moments in the first set. Could you feel that from your side of the court, that he was challenged?
M	Two good matches for you. Where to for now?
M	Andy Murray tweeted before that he was coming back from Hopman Cup and he was putting it on to watch you tonight. He said, quote, "Watching the future stars of tennis." What do you make of that?
F	Obviously not the result you wanted, but you fought really hard out. You must've been proud of that effort.
F	The way you fought your way back into the game, and especially in the second set compared with how you started, was it just nerves? Can you explain the two different shapes of that game?
F	How were the nerves at the end? You saved a couple match points.
F	Where does that fight come from? It's obviously a major strength of yours and something you develop yourself. It's something everybody can have, but you seem to have it more than other players. Where does that come from?
F	Something you get from your father?
F	Can you describe your whole week? The public's embraced you and people know who you are and they're following you. You played some good tennis. It's been an exciting week for you?
F	Does it feel any different? Obviously you made your Aussie Open debut I think last year.
F	Two years ago. How does it feel sort of this time around going into it? Is there any different feeling for you going into a tournament like that?
F	Do you know Sydney or Hobart yet?
F	Do you have a preference?
F	It was a tough start, then little by little you found your way through this match.
F	How well do you think you served today?
F	What are you doing next? What do you think of your chances for the WTA Finals given you're in such great form?
F	In Wuhan, Venus won. You pulled out due to the injury. How did you manage to get yourself together and keep from an injury? Any secrets for that? Is that because you're younger than her?
F	First Grand Slam final, first premiere event champion, first yearend finals. How satisfied are you right now?
F	Is it safe to say that things are going well with Sam in this Asia swing? Can you talk about what it's been like the last two weeks working with him.
F	With this win, you'll rise to world No.4. Talk about the significance of that achievement.
F	Your birthplace is in Venezuela. In that place there are a lot of Miss Worlds from your birthplace. When you were young, did you think you could be one of those Miss Worlds?
F	You played Angelique many times, 5All until today. How do you rate that performance?
F	Do you think you won because of the way you were playing or she wasn't playing up to her standard?
F	You have so much variety in your game. Are you happier when you hit a clean winner off of power or a strategic winner catandmouse style?
F	This is the third time you qualified for the semifinals in the last five years. Maybe you're good at some tournaments at the end of the season. Do you think so?
F	Compared with last season, this is a little bit special because we all know if you win this title, you'll have a position to go to Singapore. Coming to the semifinals, do you feel there's more and more pressure, or it's getting better and better?
F	It's a long season. Everybody seems to have some ups and downs. In the middle of the season, you played not so good. I want to know what happened to you in that time?
F	What is the big challenge playing against Kerber and what weren't you able to execute today that you thought would have made a difference?
F	Is there anything in your game that you were especially not satisfied with or it's just a question of ending the season, being not fresh enough?
F	What are your plans now for the rest of the season?
F	You and Angelique have tough encounters, including tonight. You have ups and downs on both sides in the past. How do you like the competition between you and Angelique?
F	You did very well in the first set, 53. You had your chances. What happened? Did you lose your rhythm or your opponent put a lot of pressure on you?
F	After 53 you talked with your coach. I'm sure you did some preparation for this match. Did you actually implement your strategy? Anything you want to improve upon?
F	Was it a mental reason that you didn't play very well in the second set? Did you work on any mental things?
F	In the US Open and previous years when you come up against top players, you always had a chance, but you couldn't take advantage of the key points. Have you ever talked to your coach about how to take advantage of the key points and moments?
F	What were your goals at the beginning of the year?
F	What have you learned?
F	You mentioned you were adjusting to your toss. After so many years, why have you changed your toss?
F	You did receive some guidance from your coach in this match. There's a lot of controversy regarding coaching during the match. Some people think it's good, and some people might think a coach might disrupt an athlete's rhythm. What are your feelings on being coached during a match?
F	You're on the WTA Tour, which is a little bit different from what you expected. What are the specific differences?
F	Caroline is very good at defense. In your preparation, what did you plan for?
F	In previous years you were playing tennis with family support. Now you're working with the national team, provincial team. People have different styles of development. Do you think this kind of model is more suitable for you?
F	Sharapova said when she started playing on the WTA Tour, she was here for playing matches, not making friends. A lot of players are making friends on the WTA Tour. How do you deal with the personal relationships? Do you have any close friends with other players?
F	The Asian season is almost over. What are your expectations and goals for next year?
F	How are you feeling about that match? Coco seemed to be getting some momentum towards the end. Were you surprised she pulled out?
F	A few other players have retired today, including the top seed. What does that do for you? Does it make you feel good or just the next opponent?
F	You've gone through a number of different years where you're trying to qualify for Singapore in this kind of weird lastseason push. Talk about what makes this section of the season different with respect to qualifying for Singapore. Is it a different mindset for you?
F	Those decisions to play this heavy schedule in Asia, all of that is driven by your desire to qualify for Singapore or for other reasons?
F	Talk about your confidence right now after Tokyo and everything, not a terrible loss last week, now given what Venus did in Wuhan. Are you feeling pretty good about your game?
F	I know that you went to the player area to do a manicure. A lot of women like to do the manicure. Can you show us your nails and can you tell us why you like manicure and how do you feel about this manicure at the player area?
F	That seemed like a real grinder out there.
F	Does she pose a lot of problems for players because she's like a backboard?
F	When you got to the end, what was your feeling?
F	Were you sharp today then?
F	Are you mentally tougher now? Is that why you can stay in there with her and just get better each time, finally break through and win today?
F	What do you know about playing tomorrow?
F	What's the deal with the colored fingernails, the red?
F	Did the French Open just give you an awful lot of confidence for this year? I know you struggled a little bit right after that, but you said that was coming down from the clouds.
F	Is it confidence that put you into the top 10?
F	Have you stepped your game up just a little bit this year?
M	Just want to know the first two games on his serve, did you have any trouble with the spin of his serves or something else before you really got into it?
M	Can we have a comment on the Kyrgios event? Like what do you think of this behavior?
M	Does Kyrgios have a bad reputation on the tour? What's the reputation of Kyrgios?
M	Back to the game. After you settled in, you made it look easy. It only took 54 minutes. Was it as easy for you as it looked?
M	We'd like to know more about your French word protocol. What is it? How many words do you know? Where did you learn French?
M	How many languages do you speak?
F	When you say you're still focused and want to play, think about the next match, do you really think you'll be able to play next week in Beijing?
F	Is it easy when you're playing a match not to be thinking, Okay, maybe I'm hurting myself really badly, or is it easy to block this out?
F	I'm wondering if there was a moment maybe early in the first set where obviously there's stress in the back of your mind physically whether or not you can play at your best, but maybe a missed shot from her or a point she played and didn't play the way she wanted that gave you kind of confidence?
F	In between the lines, what were you particularly pleased with with how you were able to execute today?
F	This is your biggest title since Dubai back in 2010. What does that mean for you? What do you think it means about this part of your career?
F	With this result, you'll be top 8 in the Road to Singapore.
F	Yeah. So Singapore is a possibility. Sounds like you're shocked by that. What would it mean to potentially be able to qualify?
F	That's our job.
F	Watching you play this week, just the level you were able to maintain across the tournament, it kind of made a few of us think, Gosh, if only she were on the other side of the draw at Wimbledon or the US Open. Does that ever cross your mind at all?
F	We noticed last night eagle eye. Maybe you think that is a missjudge. How do you get into the court without eagle eye?
F	I am one of your fans and also I bring my parents here to Wuhan to watch you play, especially with Radwanska, a very late game, and also a wonderful performance. I want to know will you be here in Wuhan next year and what are your expectations?
F	So in the match you were leading in the beginning, but then your opponent won. Is it because of some physical reasons? And what are your plans now?
F	How much do you think yesterday's match maybe influenced today's match? Did you feel fresh enough on the court?
F	When your coach is coming to the chair to talk to you, you have many exchanges. What can he tell you in these moments to bring you back into the match?
F	Speaking of David, how has your coaching relationship with him changed over time? Obviously he's coached you for a very long time. Is it more equal now than maybe before in terms of your dynamic?
F	From 19 until now, what's the biggest thing that he's been able to do for you as a coach?
F	With Roberta, she obviously had the big win against Serena, now this win today against you. Is she one of those players on the tour that, when she's playing well, is kind of a nightmare for players like you and Serena that like to hit a big ball and try to be offensive?
F	Not always the best way for a match to end. Can you talk about the first two sets at least, how you thought you played for the match.
F	Did you change anything in the second set tactically or improve in your game or did you notice something happening on her side?
F	What do you think was the difference between the first tiebreaker and the second tiebreaker?
F	Against a player like her, what is the game plan? What is the key to beating Maria?
F	Since this is in China, we have to talk about our greatest tennis idol, Li Na. We all know that before her retirement you are the one...
F	Do you remember that match?
F	Yes.
M	What's your assessment of the match?
M	Your assessment, your thoughts on the match.
M	Were you nervous at the processes of playing Federer?
M	What are the positives that you can take out of this tournament?
M	How did you feel physically? Because you have had a few long matches in a row.
M	Is it difficult to reset psychologically, you know, having beaten Murray yesterday? Is it difficult to reset psychologically to face Federer?
M	Were there occasions that it almost seemed unreal out there on court, that you being so young were playing the guy that when you were growing up has always been...
M	When you're getting introduced on the court and they are saying you're the youngest semifinalist ever here, youngest in the top 100, all these stats, do you feel intimidated when you're stepping on the court, or do you feel like you have something to prove? What's the mentality?
M	Growing up you must have heard a lot about Roger, how good he is, read about him, watched him. Was he as good or better? How was it playing against him?
M	You had to work pretty hard for that, didn't you?
M	What do you think you did well?
M	11
M	How do you find the court conditions?
M	Does that suit you teeing up for Indian Wells and Miami?
M	There were a group of guys in uniform sitting I don't know if you saw them. Do you know who they are?
M	Compared with this time last year, how much further advanced do you think you are?
M	What do you make of your next match? You played him recently in Australia.
M	You moved above Rafa in the world rankings, up to third yesterday. Is that nice at this early stage of the season to be on the upward curve in world rankings?
M	Looking ahead to Davis Cup, I guess there is a possibility of the Murray brothers playing the Bryan brothers. Is that a match that would intrigue you if that happened?
M	But they came here to get on the time zone. I'm sure they are going.
M	You like playing doubles with Jamie?
F	Tell us how you feel.
F	Very tough to finish off the match, wasn't it?
F	That was the confidence boost you needed?
F	How can you come to a tournament not in good form and finish it in very good form? What are the processes you go through?
F	Did it also help you to escape against Makarova from close to defeat?
F	Why do you think you were able to fight this week and not in Australia?
F	Talk a little bit about the crowd.
F	Have you been in many tournaments outside of Romania with as many fans?
F	I saw a lot of tweets the past few days saying that you breathe life into Romanian tennis. Your fans are saying that. Is that how you feel?
F	How does it feel to win as the top seed here? Obviously it may be a new development for you to live up to that billing?
F	I saw you yesterday having a big dinner with a lot of people. Friends and family?
F	Dos it help to have all these people with you at the tournament?
F	First point to the last, to my mind the best match was when you played against Makarova. Do you agree or not?
F	When I saw your match against Makarova, you were very concentrated but I did not see this when you play against Wozniacki. How can you explain?
F	What does it take to improve your performance, in the Grand Slams, your headtohead results with the likes of Serena?
F	How do you plan to improve your results
F	In the current year and matches.
F	What are you going to do about it?
F	Some players buy themselves a present or something after a big win or something. Are you one? If so, what do you have in mind?
F	Buy a house?
F	That's a big present.
F	You mentioned you had some physical problems. How are you feeling now?
F	Anything specific? We heard your hip or something.
F	Any thought on maybe skipping Doha or not?
F	It looked as if you enjoyed that out there today.
F	What do you think you did particularly well?
F	When you come in to a tournament with so many top players, do you realistically think you have a chance of winning the final?
F	How much confidence do you take from beating someone like Aga, a top seed in this tournament, going forward?
F	Are you feeling at this point your career is moving along how you wanted it to, like you're where you anticipated being at this point in time?
F	Did you ever live in Venezuela, or your mother is just Venezuelan? What's the deal?
F	And your family is where now, Spain?
F	You're kind of a citizen of both?
F	You're like a citizen of Venezuela and citizen of Spain?
F	What's your passport?
F	Have you had a chance to look around Dubai? Have you done anything?
F	How do you like the tournament?
F	What do you think you need to improve in your game to move to the next level?
F	Regular? You mean consistent?
F	What do you like to do away from tennis?
F	When did you decide to play tennis?
F	Where did you start?
F	Why did you start playing tennis? Did your family play or you saw people play?
F	We are concerned about you. Can you explain what your problem is?
F	What have the medical staff told you about that discomfort? They said it could be a result of...
F	Silly question probably, but you're not using orthotics in your shoes or anything?
F	Are you given any sort of medical guidelines on how many antiinflammatories, so forth, you should take?
F	Is it a matter of rest for you now or are you going to start back playing again?
F	We always ask you this, but could it be connected to the glandular fever?
F	What have been your global movements since Fed Cup? Where did you go?
F	Tenniswise, do you feel any concern? Because you have had such a fantastic junior career. Do you feel you've lived up to the potential that you were supposed to?
F	Can you say what these things are, what you can do better?
F	You have had a bit of a rough time healthwise with glandular fever, what happened in Australia, now obviously here. Do you think that if you were to take time out or took time away from the game to get yourself fully healthy and then you came back, would that be something you would consider from here?
F	Laura has had to pull out for her projected comeback.
F	Next week. Have you had much dialogue with her? You have been struggling with health things. She's been struggling with injury things. It's been unfortunate.
F	She's quite a bouncy character.
F	You know her as well as anybody. Is she still up?
F	Did you hit together in Florida or work out together?
F	We were told she was hitting.
F	When was this? I've got you now (smiling).
F	So what do you girls talk about?
F	What movies did you see?
F	It must have made a big impression on you.
F	Did you get a chance to hit with Martina since she's here?
F	Did you get a chance to talk to her in the locker room?
F	Anything about tennis?
F	Are you in the doubles here?
F	And do you know when you're playing?
F	It wasn't anything to do with the heat? It was really hot out there.
F	So burning or cramping?
F	Talking about boys, do you like the same kind of boys? Are you going to fight over them?
F	Who is your taste of a young star?
F	And Laura?
M	Usually you can find your way against him. You have a game that matches him quite well. Have a good record. Has something changed in the last time you played him?
M	He talked a little bit about the conditions today, just the sun getting in the eyes on part of the court. What was your experience with how things went out there conditionswise?
M	Have you changed anything on your serve lately motionwise?
M	No? Because I was thinking watching the match it wasn't looking as usual. Maybe it's me.
M	And levelwise, what do you take out of these U.S. tourneys?
M	Talk a little bit about what your expectations are after Indian Wells and Miami and what's next for you.
M	How was the game? It's a little strange to win in that way.
M	The way you were playing, as well, you looked so confident and solid out there, especially from what we saw of that first set. Is that the way you felt you were playing, that there was not much you could do wrong?
M	Is that what really made the difference for your serve, the conditions?
M	So you entered this match on a fourgame losing streak.
M	It's not?
M	Oh, okay.
M	Well, what was it like playing someone so young?
M	You only had a few tourlevel victories up to this point. How was formulating a game plan against him?
M	Hearing all this, are you getting any chance to watch the basketball?
M	How's your bracket doing?
M	Do you feel at this point you're probably going to climb up the rankings some? Are you where you want to be? Obviously not where you want to be, but do you feel like you're taking steps towards...
M	What would you say has improved since the end of last year till now?
M	It was a very hard match. How do you feel now?
M	From outside it looked like you were dominating a lot of the points against him. What made the difference at the end between the win and the loss?
M	It was a close match in Dubai. You found something different to play him compared to previous battles?
M	According to the statistics you both ended with a huge amount of unforced errors. Was it related to the wind and humid conditions?
M	Are you happy with your fitness level and that?
M	How do you explain the start in the third set, that blackout?
M	You were very aggressive. I think you played well tactically. The problem came about your forehand. You made three forehand mistakes when you were up 32 in the first set, and again in the second game of the third set three forehands. Of course, you're taking more chances with the forehand. Do you think there was some tension, some reason, technical or mental, or just a coincidence?
M	I think today everyone that said it was an anticipated final is wrong.
M	About the forehand.
M	You must obviously be very disappointed today. But don't you think tomorrow you'll leave with a different feeling with the satisfaction of a great week?
M	You were close in all of the games in the third set. You seemed very positive out there, you looked confident. Was that important for you to be really focused and believing that you could have won that match?
M	Do you think it's your best beginning of a season ever?
M	Do you think clay is the best surface for you against Djokovic? Is it easier for your game to play him on clay?
M	Did you also notice a lot of crowd support for you? Is that important?
M	Are you able to gain rhythm and confidence when you have such easy matches?
M	You may know that Seppi lost 11 matches in a row to Federer, then he won in Melbourne. You have won 11 matches in a row versus Cilic.
M	How do you explain that you beat him 11 times in a row? He's a Grand Slam winner.
M	Dimitrov was in here earlier talking about racquet changes. Rafa changed his racquet, too. I wonder if you have had to change yours in the past few years?
M	What can push a player to change in the middle of a season?
M	Speaking of aesthetics, we've seen some very strange outfits this week at this tournament.
M	No, no, no. But how much importance do you give to your style?
M	Can you tell us something about winning the Laureus award.
M	This year is completely different than last year. You seem very confident and are playing really well. How important is it for you to start the season like this, maybe to win this title another time?
M	Are the conditions very different from Houston here?
M	You played well these last tournaments.
M	Your next opponent will be Federer. What do you think of that? Usually you seem to find it easier to play him than other players.
M	Why do you find it easier to play Federer?
M	Do you always enjoy playing the top players like Djokovic and Nadal or would you prefer to play them later in the tournament?
M	Is it important for you to be among the 32 seeded players in the French Open or would you rather be seeded 35 and have maybe an easier draw?
F	Tough luck, but it's a great week for you, is it?
F	At the I end of the first set you took a medical timeout for an injury. Talk us through that.
F	When you felt the pain, do you feel it yesterday or this morning? Did you ever consider pulling out of the final?
F	Petra played amazing, like you said, so what was going through your mind when she returned winner after winner?
F	If you play, can you make the injury worse?
F	I don't know how these things work, but I saw you today and you seem really physical bad. Do you think it's the best option with the French Open in the final month to go to Rome and another big competition? Don't you think that could harm you physically?
F	Did you ever have any doubts that you would get back to this place, even just like the smallest doubt that you thought maybe you wouldn't be in a big final, wouldn't be able to beat people like Sharapova again?
F	Normally you didn't play well here in Madrid. What happened?
F	Do you think you can be in shape also in Roland Garros, and do you think you're one the favorites to win Roland Garros after doing really well here in Madrid?
F	Now with Carlos Martinez, how is your relationship? You started training in Barcelona; now you live in St. Petersburg. Where do you train with him?
F	What do you think has changed in this tournament so you played so well?
F	With the result you're again in the top 20. Is it important for you or not really important for you?
F	I saw that Blanca had a message on her skirt. Can you tell us something about that?
F	21 down in the third set, break down, and you're calling for your coach. Momentum totally switched again.
F	Caroline talked about the net calls in the first set. Do you have any comments on that?
F	Back to oncourt coaching, do you just use it because you can? Because at the end of the day at a slam it's just you and your opponent. What are your thoughts?
F	People have talked a lot about Wozniacki's resurgence over the last two years. They have said this is a brand new, more aggressive Wozniacki. Do you agree with that, or do you think it's just the same old Wozniacki who puts the ball in the court, makes you play longer rallies, and tries to grind you down?
F	Yesterday the last match of the day on center court started at 1:12 a.m. What do you think about those late starts? Do you think there should be a rule to prevent that?
F	There is nothing to do? Have top players an influence on that?
F	On a slightly lighter note, what do you think makes a good definitive fist pump: the quiet steely determination or fullon adrenaline spin your arms around?
F	I see you steely determined most of the time.
F	Looking back to last year when you played Caroline, lost in three sets. How would you assess your performance today compared to your two performances last year? Do anything differently?
F	How do you disconnect between your matches since you win until your next match?
F	You have seen training very early this morning, 9:30 I think. How important for you is to get a good result here in Madrid for the season?
F	What were you telling Caroline at the end of the match at the net? You seemed to be chatting.
F	Can we get back to the game? After that first set, that amazing first set, you lose the second set.
F	What goes on in your mind when you lose the second set? You think, Okay I got to go with the third set again with this player?
F	It's been a tough couple weeks I think parting ways with Martina and not a great start in Stuttgart. How are you easing into your clay court season after the loss to Caroline today?
F	How is your shoulder? I notice it's been strapped for a couple weeks.
F	Did the split with Martina come as a surprise, or had you seen to coming for a while?
F	What you did you learn from her in the time you were together? What's the lingering legacy?
F	At the risk of being terribly British about this, to look forward to Wimbledon with all should that she achieved there, what you learned from her, can that help you when you get to Wimbledon?
F	You're not the only person that's parted with a coach. Ana did this last weekend. She felt that it was down to her; there was nobody else to blame. Did you feel that when you played your firstround match? In the past you seemed conflicted when Martina came in. Your instincts seemed to have deserted you. First round match you seem to have that back.
F	This is better than Stuttgart then.
F	Pleasing signs of aggression coming back into your game. Talk a little bit about what you think has changed or the last couple weeks.
F	Did you feel you had some confidence coming back from such a tight firstround match? Could have gone very badly for you.
F	Did that give you a lot more confidence coming into this one?
F	This is your best win in terms of ranking of the year. Do you think that this is the confidence boost that you needed for the rest of the clay season?
F	Your coach was not there today. Any problem?
F	So you're going to go it alone now for the rest of clay court season?
F	Going to try to get somebody in place for the grass court season? You're defending in Birmingham as well.
F	How did you feel the crowd today? There was a full stadium and they were going for you.
F	Your next opponent will be Carl Suarez Navarro or Julia Goerges. Opinions about both? Carla has had an amazing year. She's fifth in the race.
F	On the topic of your coach, is there any chance at all that you will turn like a lot of the other professionals to a super coach in the future?
F	We spoke to you last year after you parted with Nigel and you went on to win; you've switched coaches twice now. You're a nice person. What is it about you that is resulting in you and coaches parting company?
F	In all seriousness though, do you feel it's making you stronger as a person having to go through the adjustments and changes, especially at this point in your career?
F	Martina Navratilova and Radwanska broke up. Would you ever consider Navratilova to be your coach? Do you think she would bring anything to your game?
F	No.
F	Who would be ideal if you could have anyone in the world?
M	Well done. You seemed to be hitting the ball very well at certain stages of that match. Did you feel like that?
M	Why did you play better and better? Is it just getting used to the surface of the court and the conditions?
M	How do you feel physically now? 100%?
M	You have got a good record against him, though, haven't you? You have beaten him more often than not.
M	Is it exactly the kind of match you need to prepare for a Grand Slam?
F	It looked like a tough one in the second set there and you were able to rally back. How was your back feeling and also how were you able to turn that set around?
F	And you mentioned some changes in preparation. Can you talk us through what your post Wimbledon has been like and how you've prepared for the U. S. hardcourt season?
F	Could you just talk about your time so far in Toronto? I know that you seem to like the city. You were at the players' party. Just want to talk about your experience in Toronto so far.
F	And just want to get your thoughts on how you'd like to do in this tournament.
F	You've been able to do something that not a lot of players have been able to do. You were No.1 in the world, dropped down to about 65 and have been able to make it back. What tactics have you used over the years to be able to reemerge the way you have?
F	What advice would you have for somebody like Genie who experienced such a rise at a young age like you did and is experiencing a tougher season now?
F	When you were down in the mid 60s there, what did you tell yourself to keep going when you were going through some coaches, and you had some injury problems and the losses seemed to keep piling up? How did you get back on that rise?
F	When you've been No.1 before, can you ever be satisfied with less, and how do you sort of reset your goals?
F	You sort of had your first big win here. I mean it was in Montreal. But at this tournament. What do you remember about that, and how do you compare yourself now and then?
F	At this point going into the rest of the season, how would you compare the last, I guess, eight months  of the seven or eight months of the season compared to the first seven or eight months of last season, like how do you compare these two seasons so far?
F	And do you think that the foot injury still from January kind of  do you feel that still affected that?
F	When you were working with some Serbian coaches, you talked about how it's easier when you can communicate in your own language and share your culture. Now you're sort of working with someone else from somewhere else. Can you still talk about that?
F	And can you just talk a little bit about why you picked going back to Nigel?
F	For the top players on the tour contending for Grand Slams, does it ever get a little frustrating knowing that one player well into her mid 30s is still playing at such a dominant, high level and she's always looming in the slams?
F	You had a pretty good start of the match today. Can you explain why it turned this way and maybe why you lost a bit of momentum?
F	You think it's all the matches before that maybe drained you a little bit, or change of the weather?
F	At the end of the second set, did you feel maybe it could turn again because she was getting nervous?
F	It was a nervy match for both. You were amazing in the beginning. A strange match, or is Safarova that more control in of the ball?
F	Do you think this tournament is going to maybe change the other part of your season, that it's going to give you maybe a second breath?
F	What are your plans for the coming grass season?
F	Just a quick word on the game yesterday between Novak and Rafa Nadal. Wanted to know if you watched it. What do you think about what Novak is accomplishing this season, and what kind of inspiration he is for Serbian players and people?
F	How proud are you of yourself and the way you managed to back up yesterday's win with another spectacular win?
F	Is Paris becoming your favorite city? Because in 2007 you played the final in Coubertin, beating three top 10 players. And here in Roland Garros you beat Amlie Mauresmo; that was also in 2007. And today this semifinal.
F	Today how did you manage to play with this wind which was very difficult?
F	Can you explain the buildup, the tournaments you played leading into this, and how it turned out how you played so well when you got here?
F	How would you compare the wind to other conditions you've played in? On Chatrier there was an incident where part of the scoreboard was blown down and fell on the crowd. Does it seem like an especially terrible wind today?
F	Usually when it's this windy the quality of play is not high, but you and Garbie in the first set were just amazing. Did you manage to take it in, like during the first set and after you won the tiebreak and realized just how good of an example of women's tennis you guys were giving?
F	What about the semifinals with Ana? How do you feel about that?
F	Do you have to make sure that you still realize the goal is to win the tournament?
F	It was a good start for you obviously in the first set, and then what do you think changed the rest of the match?
F	Does that feel like a big missed opportunity for you when you look at the draw, when you look at you were playing well coming to this tournament?
F	What is it that she does well? I mean, there is a lot of people who maybe haven't seen Timea play before. You have obviously seen her twice this year. What is it she does that causes you problems?
F	Mentally and physically how do you feel heading into the grass season now considering it's one of your favorite parts of the year?
F	Are you excited about a threeweek grass season? Adding any extra tournaments this year? Seems like an opportunity if you want to.
F	On Monday you will be No.2 in the rankings; first time since 2012. It's likely that that will probably get you a No.2 seed, I would think, at Wimbledon. What's your reaction to both of those, just being back up at No.2? And also, is it important to be seeded No.2 possibly across the draw from Serena?
F	As the sun started to go down and the temperature dropped out there, did you notice any change of conditions? Was it more difficult for you to hit through the court, or was that just Timea playing better?
M	How do you feel about today's win?
M	I think that's the first topfive player you've beaten since the French Open last year. Did it feel like an important win in that respect?
M	Can you talk about the next match against Tsonga.
M	Throughout the year you are always talking that you are feeling much better. Do you think Shanghai might be a chance for a breakthrough?
M	Can you tell us how much of today's win was about you playing well and Stan not being at his best?
M	Someone told me before your matches at the moment you're practicing for much longer than you used to. It's not necessarily a warmup, it's more a fullon practice session. Is that correct?
M	You talked many times about how you control your emotions better on court now. What changed? Did you seek help from a mental coach, sports psychologist, or did you change your own attitude?
M	Are you at the point now that you feel confident that next year you'll be contending for Grand Slam titles again, or is it too soon to tell?
M	In Beijing and in Shanghai you practice with Chinese player Zhang several times. Can you give some comments on him?
M	In the past year you've practiced with some young American players, Taylor Fritz, Noah Rubin, Stefan Kozlov. Any thoughts on any of them breaking through?
M	How did you think the conditions on the court were today?
M	Given how well you started, does that feel like a bit of a missed opportunity today?
M	Can you run us through what happened at the end of the second set.
M	The code violation, tell us how you saw that incident.
M	You didn't get any luck when you asked the supervisor to come on. He didn't have any sympathy with you?
M	In situations like that, it did look a little harsh, do you think at the moment your sort of reputation goes before you a little bit, you're a marked man?
M	I think you were arguing with the umpire. You didn't feel it was unsportsmanlike? That fine can be up to $10,000. How concerned are you that you're pushing to the $5,000 barrier?
M	Since the probation came out in the summer, have you been trying to keep your emotions in check more on the court? Is it something you think about when you're out there?
M	You said in the second set Kei started playing good. Specifically which part do you think makes him tough to play?
M	What is your plan now for the rest of the season? Doing anything different over the preseason to get yourself ready for Australia?
M	It's been an interesting year, I imagine you'd describe it. How do you feel about getting to the end of it?
M	You were saying you hadn't decided exactly what you're doing in the offseason. Have you decided where you're going to play the first two weeks of next year?
M	Yes.
M	Lleyton looks like he's going to get the Davis Cup job. I believe the players are very supportive of that. How do you feel about that appointment, if it happens?
M	Novak had eight service games against you. He had only one ace. Were you able to read his serve really well?
M	What was the problem with your side today? Was it physical? Was it mental? Was it just a bad day?
M	Obviously different conditions, different court surfaces here, but how much did the French Open final come back to you as you played Novak again for the first time?
M	It was 4All in the first and he broke you. Right after that he seemed to really take control of the match. Were you having some disbelief at that point after he broke you?
M	Is he really playing that well, do you think, right now?
M	That long game you played, 30 points altogether, back and forth. Hard to concentrate playing a guy like that?
M	Benoit said although this is the first match, you guys know a little bit just from the time you spent in the south of France. Can you talk about your friendship and your relationship with him?
M	You played Roger for many years and you've played him in Grand Slam finals for many years. Do you feel any sort of sense of slippage or changes in his game throughout these years? Do you feel like he's coming forward more than he was when you were playing him...
M	It's been about a week since what happened in Montreal with Kyrgios. ATP is still determining possible further penalties. What do you think would be a fair decision?
M	On a different front, maybe you rubbed some people the wrong ways at some points...
M	We are in the hard court season. So many players say it's such a tough transition with the different conditions. How long does it take you to get used to coming from Canada here? Is it like playing from a different surface altogether?
M	You're famously careful about what you eat. I'm wondering where Centre Court grass fits into the diet and how much sweeter it tastes compared to the disappointment of Roland Garros?
M	Today you seemed to be less nervous than in some other matches during the previous week. Is it true, or were you nervous? What was your reaction when you lost those seven set points in the second set? Did you start thinking, The way he played against Murray, if he plays against me, can be a problem?
M	You mention your childhood. Your childhood coach spoke to you about the storms and the calms. Today you tasted grass. A few weeks ago you tasted defeat. Talk about dealing and managing the ups and downs of this sport.
M	There were many obstacles during these two weeks. Maybe people were thinking Federer was the favorite going into this final. At the end of the match when you celebrated the victory, was it maybe also that you proved again people wrong?
M	Consecutive Wimbledon titles against Roger Federer, the player you've called the best of all time. You've competed on an even level with maybe the two best players, definitely the two best players of the era. In your career, what are your thoughts on what you've accomplished to date and what do you think is ahead?
M	What has Boris said to you about your achievement of his mark of winning three Wimbledon titles? Now nine Grand Slam titles, ahead of legends of the game like Agassi and Lendl, how does that feel?
M	To be able to beat Roger backtoback years here, as much as you revere him and this place, how do you describe your 'wow' factor? Is there a party going on inside of you right now?
M	The BBC ran a poll just before the match started saying 75% of the people here were supporting Roger. Does that bother you at all? You could sense that in the stands. Do you think maybe now with your track record, they might get behind you?
M	In the last game you hit two return winners. You roared basically after that second one which set up the match point. This is a surface and tournament where Federer has dominated. To be able to do that, what does it take and what does it feel like to do that?
M	If it weren't for one match, you might be going to the US Open with Serena going for a Grand Slam, calendaryear Grand Slam. Talk about the US Open.
M	The extra week between Paris and here means that your wedding anniversary is now with Wimbledon.
M	How does Jelena feel about the new scheduling and that you get to bring the nice shiny trophy back home?
F	What does it mean to you to be in the Wimbledon final?
F	It should be mentioned sometime back you were having problems with your knees. Now you're in the finals of Wimbledon. You got a text from Conchita. Could you tell us about that text.
F	Yes.
F	Did she give you any tips about the finals?
F	Have you surprised yourself at how well you've played on grass here?
F	You're now on your longest run on grass. Your last run was 'sHertogenbosch coming into today. What has been the difference between two years ago and now?
F	Speaking of mental toughness, the momentum seemed to shift significantly in the second set. You got it back again. Can you describe how you managed to regain your composure there?
F	Did she change the tactics on you, try to make you run more? What did you feel she was doing differently?
F	Last year after your win against Serena in Paris, someone was asking you if you are more famous in Venezuela or Spain. You said, I'm not famous at all. Same question now.
F	How would you describe Serena Williams, and what would be the challenge for you if it is Serena in the final?
F	What is it about her that makes her one of the best ever in your mind?
F	Where have your parents been watching from? Are you going to have to tell them to stay away now?
F	They're in Barcelona?
F	Are they going to come?
F	Can you tell us some things about yourself away from tennis that you like to do? For example, do you like football or cooking?
F	You talk a lot about your poker face, your need to keep a poker face. How hard is that for you? Why do you feel the need to keep it kind of all kept in?
F	This is your first big run at Wimbledon, but you've had the big runs at the French Open. How have those taught you about yourself and how to handle the pressure, the media pressure, and how to handle a Grand Slam coming into the later stages?
F	You're very calm in a great way in this situation. Deep down inside, what are you trying to find? Obviously a final is a whole different story. What are you going to try to dig deep in and try to find that maybe you haven't had before?
F	Emotionally, what do you want to get out of yourself? This is going to be the stage of all time for you.
F	You have many challenges now, even if you want to think only about Sunday. Sanchez and Martinez winning a lot. The top Spanish players are getting older. Nadal, Ferrer, Robredo. Do you see yourself in a way to be able to replace the image of all these players who may end their career while you are taking off?
F	Talk a little bit about changing your tactics and game. Obviously something Aga does well and did in that match. Do you have a good PlanB when Plan A is not working?
F	Getting to the semis, you have to be pleased. Is there any part of the game as we move on in the semis you would like to be concentrating more?
F	Coco complained a few times to the chair umpire she thought you were moving her during service motion. Did you hear her saying that?
F	Did you feel like you were doing anything different than you usually do on your return?
F	She actually said what you did was unsportsmanlike. How do you react to that?
F	What does knowing the history of Wimbledon and the women who were here before you, whether it be as far back as Althea Gibson, Billie Jean King, Steffi Graf, all those players, what does that mean to you? Are there players from whom you take specific images and memories?
F	When you've seen your name on that trophy with these greatest names in the history of the sport, what are the feelings that that evokes for you?
F	Is there a special feeling coming back to the semifinal here?
F	How crucial is that third week of grass gap between the French and Wimbledon for you? Would you be here now without that third week?
F	Were there times when you were still getting better that you thought Wimbledon might not be your year this year?
F	You'll play Serena possibly. How exciting is that?
F	Do you feel in yourself that you're playing really well? You're having some struggles in matches which is absolutely normal. How do you feel your tennis is?
F	When you've seen Vika go through the injuries she has, you know your own experience, what goes through your mind as you've watched her progression from being at her lowest point to where she is today?
F	When you played Serena here 11 years ago, you were a big underdog. You would be an underdog again this time. Anything about your mindset going into that match 11 years ago that you can rekindle or is it so far long ago?
F	11 years is a very long time. Do you ever find yourself replaying memories of 2004, when you were on Centre Court? Is it a feeling that you're very restless to recapture?
F	What do you say to people who are critical of how vocal you are and the noise you make on court? Quite a reaction on Twitter today as there generally is. What do you say to that?
F	It's up to you.
F	You have a pretty special rivalry with Azarenka. If it's Vika in the semifinal, what do you think of it?
M	A pretty solid match. Talk about how it went.
M	Can you talk about going for the clay/grass double. Never been in this position before. How has the transition been?
M	Obviously we've had Roger on top for so long. Now you as well. Why do you think there haven't been younger players from Switzerland coming up behind you?
M	Is it something that you as players have noticed?
M	Did you feel that you were close to making that a very tight match and possibly a fifth set?
M	How was the atmosphere for you out there? Because of course he's British. He got more support than you. Was it still okay for you, everything?
M	A key point obviously in the seventh game of the fourth set with that volley, the sequence seemed to be that it dropped in, Andy played it, you volleyed it back in, and there was a challenge. Did you think that was right that the challenge was allowed or...
M	Were you happy with the officiating?
M	How would you rate your serve today? Was it on a normal base or a bit lower?
M	Is that a tribute to his returning or that you weren't quite as good as you had been in the first three rounds?
M	What did you think of his lob today?
M	Have you been lobbed many times like that?
M	Never?
M	Are you saying then that the umpire you clearly thought your eyes told you that the ball was on the line. Do you think the umpire maybe should have intervened and perhaps disputed the HawkEye call? Is that what you're saying?
M	No, I thought that's what you were suggesting possibly.
M	How proud are you in particular to be the oldest man to have reached this stage since another Croat has won? It's a historic Wimbledon for you.
M	You had a tremendous introduction on Centre Court when you beat Hewitt all those years ago. How do you look back on yourself then and where you are now?
M	Could you imagine then everything you have done since then?
M	Interesting. Talk us through the match.
M	Then the turn around, what happened?
M	A lot was made of your medical break on the television. I don't know if you were aware. People were saying, was it for real? Did your leg really hurt?
M	Andy, he was saying nothing wrong, nothing wrong in the match. Andy seemed a bit annoyed at that stage?
M	Momentum just changed again?
M	It seemed at the end, did you say to Andy, How's your shoulder? Is that right?
M	You seemed happy. Not happy to lose, but you seemed happy with each other. You weren't angry?
M	How are you feeling now with the injury?
M	What do you make of the way he's playing overall?
M	On the question of the timeouts, do you think that a lot of players do use the timeouts wrongly to disrupt a player's rhythm?
M	Do you think that in this match it was the timeouts that changed everything both times?
M	What was your injury?
M	Physio are genius?
M	Fantastic.
M	I was wondering if you could compare your 2008 final with Rafa and the one with Novak in 2014?
M	In terms of match quality, excitement, and which was more memorable for the fans, in your opinion.
M	You don't talk much about your records or things like that being all that significant to you. Is there some meaning for you to the pursuit of an eighth Wimbledon title, something that's never been done, given this place, the history of this tournament?
M	What do you think the Williams sisters' rivalry with one another has meant to the sport? What are your thoughts about Monday's matchup between them?
M	Often when I see matches of yours on TV, the commentators say that you don't like Hawkeye. I think you said some comments about it early in its history. How do you feel about it now and its role in the game?
M	Should it be on every court then, by the same principle?
M	You've talked a lot about how content and happy you are off the court. Does that change much when you step on the court, not so much winning or losing, but in terms of how you react to certain things, compared to 10 years ago?
M	You talked before the tournament about the extra week being good for your preparation. You seem very much in control this week. Your play has confirmed that.
M	I know you have very tight schedule, but I heard that you have promised to come to Helsinki in November.
M	Can you talk a little bit about how your relationship with Stefan has evolved? It clearly must change as you go through different phases. What do you talk about, how you get along, that sort of thing.
M	What, if anything, do you have to change about your game when a guy is serving that fast at you?
M	Let's see. Two fiveset matches. First time you ever came back from Love2 in the first round. Now this one. You must be feeling pretty high.
M	Did you come into this tournament feeling like this feels a little bit different from the other majors?
M	So many people, I don't look at the draw, I don't care. It sounds like you were looking at it a little bit and thinking...
M	You won two tourlevel matches till now. Now you have won three. Why is this happening now? Any special thing going on?
M	Talk about the coaching change. Who was there before?
M	Are you independent?
M	You are in the fourth round. When you envisioned this moment coming in your career, did you know or think it would be Wimbledon, or did you think it would be somewhere else?
M	Tell us about your grass court. You say obviously it's your favorite surface. When did you first encounter it?
M	In terms of your game, how does it translate on grass, specifically?
M	That's why I ask. I know the lazy take is big server, big guys, you know, volleyers, these are the guys that are going to do well. We see more counterpunchers and baseliners obviously get great success on this surface.
M	How tall are you?
M	Have you found this tougher than you expected when you were a kid. Are you enthusiastic? You spent a lot of this year on the challenger circuit. You have been out here a couple of years.
M	How did you get into tennis as a kid?
M	But nobody else is playing?
M	Were you trouble?
M	What kind of bad things did you do?
M	What went wrong today?
M	How have your expectations of yourself changed over the last year and several months, if at all?
M	Do you see yourself ever getting back at Wimbledon to the form where you won? Do you ever see yourself being able to reproduce that?
M	Your form at Wimbledon in particular is not very good over the last four years, from the high standards you set. Do you see yourself getting back to how you were playing at Wimbledon in 2010?
M	Does that worry you?
M	How much was it about his unusual style of game and how much was it about the issues with your game?
M	You reached five finals between 2006 and '11 in a row. Now it's four defeats against players outside the top 100. How much of a disappointment is that for you? How much of a problem on your Wimbledon record is that?
M	How difficult is it for you to stomach those defeats in a row in consecutive years?
M	You seem to be more disappointed than we've seen you in previous press conferences here when you've lost. Does it feel more disappointing this year?
M	You said that you enjoy being at Wimbledon and having your big house and your family. I see your mother is here, your sister is here. Will you stay in London a little bit or you go straight back to Mallorca now?
M	Years ago it was said that clay court players often didn't come to Wimbledon with the sense that they will work hard, give everything to win on grass. You did that. You changed that whole tradition. Is that something that you think is an important part of what you have done in your career? Is that something you feel good about, your desire to win here?
M	If grass court tennis was a person, if it was a human being, how would you describe your relationship with that person?
M	You had to grind that one out?
M	Did you need treatment at any stage and what was it?
M	Clearly you'll need a good night's sleep if you play Novak.
M	Four years ago you played him here. How much has changed in your game and what are your memories of that day?
M	Can you take anything out of those matches in Perth and Kooyong, even though they are XOs?
M	I think he was on that big roll then, only lost one match for the year. Do you think he's at that same level now?
M	You mentioned the heat being an issue for you today. Would you be in favor of a male heat rule being brought in?
M	When you played Rafa a few years ago at the Aussie Open and Novak at Wimbledon, they seem to raise your game. You sort of had no choice but to really go for your shots. Do you feel that can help?
M	Tough to have a guy shut it down that way, firing a couple three aces and end of story, right?
M	They talk a lot about the grass being a lot slower now than it used to be back in the day. How does that affect the serve of a guy like that? How much less dangerous is it, if at all?
M	Do you see any evolution in Milos' game from, say, 2013?
M	Were you surprised how badly he misses sometimes?
M	You brought up your surgeries and you have also said you don't really like to look back. But you have had so many illnesses and surgeries and setbacks that way. Could you just talk about that? Do you think it's a matter of bad luck? Or just reflect on that.
M	You said you learned from all these setbacks. What's the prime thing you have learned going through all you did healthwise?
M	How special is it to have your family around and, you know, and your daughter?
M	Bar the second set, pretty smooth sailing for you?
M	Enjoy being back on Centre Court, though? Been a while.
M	When you come away, do you feel on one hand you weren't dictating as much as you wanted to, but on the other hand you came away with a straightsets win against a guy who played so well? How do you weigh it up?
M	I heard it was 43 degrees on court sometimes today, on Centre Court. Was it an issue heatwise? Do you think the heat break rule in the women's game, is it fair that guys don't have the same option if need be?
M	How did that compare to the oppressive heat in Melbourne or the humidity in New York? Is it getting near that?
M	The two matches before were over so quickly before you, you were on earlier than expected?
M	On Friday the country is planning a commemoration of the tragedy in Tunisia. At times like that, what do you feel the role of athletes for the country?
M	Missing the real heat wave of tomorrow, but Robin Haase up next. Have you played him recently?
M	You talked about the stress of the week coming up to your first match at Wimbledon, mentioned mouth ulcers and things that you've had. What has it been like this time around?
M	You sent a tweet yesterday congratulating Liam. He's back tomorrow. What are your thoughts on his prospects?
M	You were saying you were frustrated because you couldn't bring your best to the court today. In some ways is that good because you want your best for a week from Sunday?
M	James Ward is 21 up. Al is into a fifth. How much of a difference does it make to you and the tournament if a few Brits get through a few rounds?
M	Just as you go on in your career, do you see potential future British as important to your legacy to the game?
M	How did it feel, your first victory here at Wimbledon in front of a British crowd?
M	Do you feel a part of it now, the Wimbledon experience, your first as a Brit?
M	I heard the roar go up from the crowd when you won it. Must be the greatest feeling you've had?
M	The last two years you played here as a Slovenian. Talk about the difference in support compared to the last two years.
M	Is it even better that it was a good day for British tennis? Are you aware of the other results?
M	The process has taken a long time for you to get where you are. That win, does it make you feel more British in a funny kind of way?
M	Do you think your arrival as a Brit will make the Brit's play better in the future, more competition for them?
M	You have a tough game on Thursday. Do you start thinking straightaway of the next thing or do you get a chance...
M	Not going to watch the highlights then?
M	He seemed to be getting grumpy at times, especially in the first set when you broke him to take that set, with the umpire. Were you aware of that? Do you think it was gamesmanship by him?
M	You were heckling people from in here. You must be in a pretty good mood?
M	But you got out in three.
M	Why is that? Why first day and play early?
M	Would you say on a scale of 1 to 10 that you played like 8?
M	Why was that?
M	At a slam is it easier following a women's match that can go less than an hour?
M	Some people say women should play best of five or same schedule. I don't know what your stance is on that or how much longer that would make these days?
M	Do you remember who was after you five years ago, who was waiting for that match?
M	No. It could not have been fun.
M	I think so, too.
M	What does Arthur Ashe's legacy mean to you as people are thinking about the 40th anniversary of his defeat of Jimmy Connors here?
M	Is there anything that you have heard that is especially striking to you about the sacrifices he made or the stances that he took?
M	Is there anything else in tennis like the queue here and how special it is for these fans to line up for hours?
M	Your persona outside the court, you're very lively, bubbly now, but in court you just don't show sometimes emotion at all. You swing quietly. Why the two...
M	You do something outside tennis or just tennis? Hobbies?
M	What kind of books?
M	From this side of the pond you seem to have done a great job in shouldering American's men's tennis hopes since Andy finished. What do view as still your best chance at a slam, going deep in the slams, which of the slams?
M	Do you draw any additional pressure being the leading American male?
M	When you think about what Serena Williams has the opportunity to do, having won the first two majors, what goes through your mind about the magnitude, the challenge and the way she's playing?
M	What do you enjoy most when you watch her play, or what impresses you the most?
M	You said you don't watch that much tennis compared to other sports, but it seems you knew what Serena said. Do you read a lot of the news?
M	In general, you don't read...
M	(Indiscernible.)
M	You talked about shouldering the burden of being American No.1. Serena, do you think having her on the women's side and being an American winning so much during the whole time you have been American No.1 has made life any easier for you in terms of she's helping carry the flag?
M	Given your appreciation of the other sports, you're a big fan of so many, where do you consider Serena to be on the list of all athletes, not just tennis players?
M	All those comebacks at the French Open, five of them I think if I recall correctly, one after another. Have you ever seen a performance like that in sport?
M	When someone's hot like Gonzlez was tonight, is there anything you can take out of the match?
M	Have you ever played somebody playing that well?
M	How tricky was the wind out there?
M	Apart from his level of execution, how different a player did you feel he was just in terms of the way the ball came at you, the way he moved...
M	With his game, do you feel he has a realistic chance of upsetting Roger on Sunday?
M	Did you watch Andy and Roger last night?
M	There was very little in the match as far as stats are concerned.  Where do you think you lost it?
M	How disappointed are you?
M	So it was to do with the tempo of the game.  He had a quicker tempo than you did?
M	How do you rate his chances in the semis?
M	What did you make of having Hawk-Eye available on a match point?
M	We're only at the start of a very long year.  Do you believe that as the year goes on you can genuinely bridge the gap between yourself and the top two?
M	Did you notice what Tommy was saying after the third set?  He was speaking to himself.
M	Did that irritate you any in any way when you were sitting on your chair and heard what he said?
M	Just on the rankings, it is important for you, do you believe to protect No.  3 and cut the gap between 2 and 3?
M	Airness is French?
M	You are happy with that?
M	With a Roddick semifinal next, how did you assess tonight's match?
M	10 service breaks in the match, five in the first set.  Was that due to the wind?
M	You've been with Tony Roche for a couple years.  Talk a little bit about what he brings to the table for you, and how long you expect that relationship to continue.
M	What is your relation like with him in general?  Is it really more like a friendship?  Is there a father figure involved?  Is it all business?
M	Are you satisfied where your game is at at this stage of the tournament?
M	Do you think your volley will be an important part of your game against Roddick?
M	When you played Andy at Kooyong, did he look like a different player to you than he's been since his improvements began?
M	Your efforts in getting the job done in three sets is outstanding.  Is that your own personal benchmark?  Do you have that in the back of your mind that you don't want to be dropping a set?
M	Do you set that down as a target to say, I want to do it in three all the way through?
M	Do you have a cold here?
M	Given how good you are on grass, do you think the courts are ideal for you generally across the board or would you prefer more faster-court tournaments?
M	Than there are.
M	Is Roddick at much more of a disadvantage in a three-out-of-five-set match because eventually you figure him out towards the end?
M	For you.  Versus two out of three at Shanghai.
M	In early '03 people were questioning when or if you would win a Slam.  After 2003 Wimbledon, the rest is tennis history.  What was the critical difference between you in '02 and '03?
M	Did you ever get impatient or concerned about your progress in Grand Slams?
M	Did you watch any of the Murray/Nadal match last night?  If so, what were your impressions?
M	Were you surprised how hard Andy pushed him?
M	When you're 12-1 against a guy, like you are with Roddick, is he a real rival to you?  Do you consider him to be a real rival?
M	You're the one out there that plays with the smallest racquet on court.  Did you try a bigger size?  You're playing with a 90.  Did you try a 95 and you didn't like?
M	With the 95?
M	It's still the smallest on tour.
M	The string combination, you have a special string combination, filament and gut.  Usually players have the strings the other way around.
F	The difference in the two sets, the first one absolutely magnificent, but what happened in the second?
F	We saw you feeling better and better each match.  Can you possibly say where you are in relation to your best tennis?  80, 85%?
F	What about the prospect of taking on Martina again?
F	Does it give you extra confidence knowing you beat her at the same stage last year?
F	You haven't lost to her since she came back.  Do you think this year she'll be a much harder proposition than last year?  Maybe she was a little green.
F	Both of you have so much affection in Australia.  Who do you think will get the majority of support?
F	How comfortable do you feel here compared with other venues around the world?
F	(Question regarding the pressure of being a favorite to contend for the title.)
F	Martina took three years off for injury, has come back.  Could you ever see yourself doing the same thing, or is this definitely...
F	What about visiting Australia beyond this Australian Open?
F	You said earlier you and Martina have a good off-court relationship.  Will you talk to each other before this game?
F	Any wedding plans?
F	You still have to focus on winning the tournament, good memories.  Is there any room for sadness, knowing at the end of the week Australia will be finished?
M	Must be nice to get through tight spots like that.  Up and down.
M	Feel overdue to be in the last eight of a major finally?
M	How did this match not get away from you?  You were in the driver's seat, controlling well.  He digs back in.
M	You and Andy go back a long way.  You've never met at this stage of a major.
M	How does this compare to the silver medal at the Olympics?
M	Talk about some of your mental work with Todd.  Seems to be working out pretty well for you.
M	How many sets do you think you and Andy have played total, including practice sets as kids?
M	What would you have to improve to win a Slam?
M	Todd is a pretty cerebral guy, pretty intense.  You're pretty laid back.  How does that work?
M	What is separating you and Andy?
M	For you it's stepping up on the big points?
M	Do you have to get in his face, match his intensity?
M	Have you practiced at all since you've been down here?
F	What happened after the first set?  You looked so good in that first set.
F	What do you take out of the match?
F	Is it that you haven't had a lot of those sort of tough matches, and she's No.8 in the world?
F	Do you come out of tonight's experience thinking you can get clear to the top 20 type player than you thought, or not as close as you might have thought a week or so ago?
F	What about how you'll reflect on the tournament?  Beforehand if someone had said you'd get a couple of wins, would that have satisfied you?
F	Where Patty adapted in the match, do you think that's where you failed to?
F	In adapting to the match, she changed her tactics.  Do you think you could have done something different?
F	Your ambitions for the year have been enhanced by this tournament?  What had you hoped to do first of the year coming into here?
F	Going into the third set, were you still thinking positively?
F	After this it's off to Asia?
M	Andy, the stats indicated there wasn't a lot between you and Marat.  Why did you think you won it?
M	Is it a sense of relief as much as anything?
M	What sort of inspiration was Jimmy Connors at courtside?
M	Did it put any extra pressure on you knowing he had come all this way and got here today?
M	If it was somebody that you had less concerns about playing, do you think he would have come?
M	If it was somebody who you had fewer concerns about playing, do you think he would have come?
M	Were you especially pleased with the way you kept your focus in that fourth set when the break points came and went and he was raging?  It was important that you kept it all together and did what you had to do, wasn't it?
M	How difficult is it to focus, though, when he's on that emotional roller coaster?
M	Does it give you tremendous confidence heading into the rest of the tournament beating a guy like Marat?
M	Did you treat that match as kind of a revenge game for a lost match in September in Moscow against Marat?
M	Were you quite happy with the conditions?  He obviously seemed unhappy that there were patches of damp around parts of the court.  He didn't want to play when the roof was closed.  And you were just standing at the back obviously ready to play.
M	Has your union with Jimmy, has that been good for the sport do you think in the sense of bringing a legend of the game, back into the fold, giving the crowd a bit of interest and attention?
M	There were a lot of challenges out on the court tonight.  It was a bit like a poker game, went to throw them up and when to use them at those strategic times?
M	What would you say Jimmy's major contributions have been to you?
M	No, they weren't that specific.
M	You are 4-0 up against Mario Ancic.  Do you expect an easier job for you?
M	Two months.
M	Missed the US Open.
M	Are you the sort of player that looks forward to playing tiebreaks?  You seem to play it pretty well.
M	When you play Marat, is it a case of -- you mentioned emotional roller coaster.  Is it also a case of having these spurts of brilliance and have to ride it out until it passes, as well as the volatility?
M	Marat seemed to absorb your big serves there for most of the match.  When you have a situation like that, do you push a bit more on the serve, or do you just vary your serve?
M	But then you picked up the first serve in the last set, and that helped?
M	You must be pleased, but also relieved you were able to win that in straight sets.  It was quite a tough match, wasn't it?
M	Do you think a year ago there may have been a different outcome?
M	How do you benefit from a match like that?  What do you take out of it now?
M	You asked for an ice towel.  Did you consider an ice vest?
M	When was the last time you played in conditions that hot?  We were boiling where we were.  You must have been feeling it big time down there.
M	You've now played three matches here, all on the same Vodafone.  Would you rather play somewhere else?  Are you getting used it and it might be an advantage?
M	Is your serve -- do you think that's the area that -- to get you up to the real elite of the ATP,  that's the area that --
M	Well, Slam winning let's put it.
M	You beat Chela the end of last year.  How much will you relish the opportunity to play him here again, get a bit of revenge against him?
M	What does it mean to you personally and professionally to have your brother on tour with you?
M	What sort of doubles team would you make?  Are you on the same wavelength?  Do you complement each other?
M	Does it feel a bit strange being on the other side of the world, getting such strong support from thousands of people?
M	Did you hear the chorus of, "Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"?
M	Are you doing that more now perhaps?
M	Some of the people have been saying maybe Hawk-Eye is not such a good thing now.  Federer was saying he didn't like it yesterday.  Bjorkman was saying the umpires kind of hide behind it.  I guess you would have liked Hawk-Eye out there today, wouldn't you?
M	You hadn't played Verdasco, but obviously had seen him play.
M	What was the tactical plan?
M	12 months on, where do you think you made the biggest improvement?  Is it mentally or physically going into the Chela game?
M	You were two points away from winning that match when the rains came.  What was going through your mind at that moment?
M	You had some amazing shots in that match that none of us had really seen too much of from you.  Tell us about where you've been training, where you're from, and what your hopes are?
M	Does performing this close to someone like Safin help your confidence?
M	Was that the first time you had ever played over a full five sets?
M	And did you feel the pressure and the tiredness in that last set?
M	Why is it the Israelis are always able to produce one good players every few years.  There's always one or two.  Why is that?
M	Harel Levy, Mansdorf is good.
M	It's not because of good facilities or good coaches?
M	You say you broke your elbow.  How did you do that?
M	Hurdles?
M	When was that?
M	How long did you -- was it before you --
M	You said you're friends with Baghdatis.  Do you work out with him a lot?
M	You did well here in the juniors one year, didn't you?
M	So it wasn't a surprise, the conditions weren't a surprise?
M	You realize that in four sets you were probably the better player on the court?
M	Would you happily describe this as the game of your life even though you lost?
M	When the rain came out were you cursing?  You had the momentum there and --
M	A good start to the tournament given the conditions today, a lot of seeds having troubles.  What are your thoughts on your match?
M	Had no problems with the conditions?
M	There's been talk that the court might be a bit faster this year.  Did you find it faster than when you were here two years ago?
M	Does that suit you or not?  Is it good for you or not?
M	You feel the ball is faster than the other one?
M	Does this mean you don't have enough opportunities to practice with similar balls?
M	What about your injury from last week?  Is that all gone now?
M	Do you feel a hundred percent comfortable with your shorts you wear?  Have you ever thought about changing them?
M	If you compare with the match against the same opponent in Wimbledon, what was better today?  The conditions are better for you?  He played less well?  You played better?
M	Would this be a good surface to play Roger on for you?
M	Let's say if you do.  Does Rebound Ace help you or not?
M	There was some talk about the heat rule.  Some players had to play in the heat, some others didn't play, some like you played indoors.  Do you feel it's fair in a Grand Slam tournament that players play in different conditions?
M	You call that the endless tiebreaker?
M	Was it a case of not known your opponent well enough in that first set?
M	What's going through your head when you're down a break and a set?
M	You had quite a few discussions with the chair umpire.  What was getting under your skin out there?
M	It's a bit of an anomaly here where you can challenge the calls on center court but you can't anywhere else.  Do you have a feeling one way or the other if you have that technology it should be extended to all courts?
M	Would you have challenged calls today if you had the opportunity?
M	How many do you think?
M	Quite a bit.
M	You don't have that many challenges --
M	Regardless of how much you played in the buildup to here, how tough is it to come into a Grand Slam so soon in the year?
M	What did you take out of Kooyong?  What did you take out of last week?
M	Did that third set have the same intensity as any other third set you've played against him in the past?
M	When you're so unhappy with so many calls, does that bleed over into your game?  Noticed that last argument you double faulted on the next point?
M	Has Jimmy taught you how to challenge line calls?
M	There's no seeded women at this tournament from the United States.  Are you disappointed overall with the state of American tennis at the moment?
M	At the end of the first set you told the central umpire that he was a glorified scorekeeper, and you said I think we should get machines.  Obviously heat of the moment.  But is there a part of you that thinks that one day tennis is going to be better off being run by machines than by people?
M	Should they have the challenge in Vodafone, given it's very similar conditions to Rod Laver Arena, indoors, a showcourt, that sort of thing?
M	Had you played this kid in the juniors?
M	What was the condition like out there going from the cool haze to the pretty bright sun there?
M	Are you talking to Jimmy every couple days?  Is John talking to Jimmy?  How is that going to work?
M	Is there a possibility he's coming down maybe second week?
M	How did you find the speed of the court?  Was it any faster or slower than last year?
M	Did Tsonga take you by surprise out there with as hot as he was playing early?
M	The situation that James is in with Carlos, have you been in that situation where you played a guy back-to-back?  How do you deal with that psychologically?
M	What about just week-to-week playing the same guy?
M	Would you rather have a tough match for your first round like you did out there or a triple bagel?
M	Wonderful week.  You gave Italy a terrific week.  What does it feel like now?  Are you feeling that you've crashed?  Are you glad that you good did so well?
M	Are you working on your serve?
M	(From Italian) Did you expect to find such a tough player in front of you?  You had to win the match three times.
M	Is there anything you're disappointed in how you weren't able to finish it more quickly, in your game, anything that disappointed you?
M	When you walked out to play -- I know he's in the other half of the draw -- but you looked in here and Roger was here.  Does it make any difference to your mentality knowing that he's out of the tournament, or there is sort of an excitement about that?
M	(In Italian) Do you think that you won the match on a physical basis, not only mentally?
M	(In Italian) You will meet Robredo or Simon.  Robredo is leading at the moment.  So if it's Robredo, what do you think about this opponent?
M	Any reaction?  Are you surprised that Roger lost?  Did you watch a little bit on television, the quality of the match?
F	(From Italian)  You went four times in a final and you lost the four finals, why?
F	It wasn't a question of needing to break serve out there, it was a question of needing to hold serve, wasn't it?
F	Not to be impolite, but you had so many balls that just seemed like gimmes if you hit them over.  Did something cramp up in your mind?
F	Isn't that also because she is very quick on the court so you have to try to hit the ball maybe taking some risk, otherwise the ball will come back?
F	What will you do between now and Roland Garros?
F	The fact that you have tape on your arm was a problem for you, or not?
F	What exactly is the problem with the arm?
F	Has this week still been perfect preparation for the French, though?
F	You've been having physical problems too.  How is everything going now?
F	Can you see why did he ask you about your physical condition?
F	I don't have to chase dropshots though.  Is this a break for you?  Would you have liked to have played longer today?
F	It looks like your English is very nice.  Somebody told me you speak fluent French; is that true?
F	They told me you had a degree.
F	You've been asked this a number of times, but are we going to see more and more and more Russians in this game?
F	Part two:  Does that keep you eager and alert looking back there and seeing all these kids coming?
F	Do you agree with my friend Ana?  I said to her, How come there are so many good Russian players?  And Ana said to me, But it is the family.  The really motivation comes from the family.
F	What is a name of a young Russian players for the future?  Do you see anybody who plays very well for the next years?
F	Also the young players.
F	Pavlyuchenkova?
F	(From Italian) Talking about your mother, who's here on the court and off the court.  Is it very close relationship?  Could you go on playing without her?  Could you win without her?  Or is it really very symbiotic between you?
F	Is she a good player?
F	A student of the game as well as a player?
F	After the big results you already had, which is the goal of this year for yourself?  I mean, you have a tournament in your mind?  You have a result in your mind, or ranking?
F	When a press conference finish and the journalists don't ask about your serve, which sort of relief do you have?
F	Yeah.  But you can't give me the last answer about that, because someone says you have a problem, a physical problem there and cannot do something.
F	Because you are talking with yourself about the moment, you are thinking too much, what?
F	So you give an answer that you just don't think about it.  We never hear about why your boyfriend or your husband or whatever.  Why?  Because he doesn't exist?  You didn't met the ideal man or you don't want to show him in any way?
F	We are curious.  We are journalists.
M	Can you tell us your view of the meeting and how it went and what you foresee?
M	Does it seem like it's possible that there's going to be progress from your view?
M	I talked with Ricci Bitti and he said he asked to have a meeting with you; is that correct?  And apparently, he said he didn't know that you were not happy about scheduling and the calendar of the Davis Cup.  He was never told by anyone that you wanted to play week after the slam.
M	Your next opponent hasn't got a very good record.  He's never won a set against you.  How are you feeling about that?  Is that something is that is going to work to your advantage?
M	Did you feel like you were moving a little bit better today than you had the other day?
M	You are a human being.  How much difficult is it to change your level from an average match and then click, go?  How difficult is it?
M	Against Seppi and today we see you always in control just the time you need to go.
M	Just on the political thing again.  You and Rafa came in a couple days ago and the president of the ATP and the president of the ITF flies in.  Makes you kind of aware of the responsibility and the power that the No.1 and No.2 players in the world have.  When they want something to change everyone comes running.  What do you make of that?  Do you wish you had those conversations before, or does it just go to understand what power and what influence you have on the sport?
M	Were you happy with the way it was played out?  You did your piece.  Did you read or did you listen to what the press --
M	You going to play Rafa in Mallorca in May.  What do you feel about it?
M	On Ricci Bitti again, he said that you have been informed by the ATP more than from him, because he say --
M	Yeah.
M	From these meetings do you get the sense that this has really brought the players closer together?
F	Congratulations.  How does this compare to the first?
F	Why no nerves at all all day?
F	Daniela, do you wonder why you can't bring that same feeling or same approach to other tournaments?
F	Does it feel like a monkey's come off your back a little bit, getting the win finally after all these years?
F	Can you kind of take us -- what happened with your career right after you won here in 2002?  'Cause like when you won in 2002, it looked like the start of some bright things.  Can you kind of take us through?
F	Not to pry, but it seemed like as soon as the match ended, you were off the side, you were calling somebody on the phone?
F	So how did this conversation with your mom go?
F	So how does this year's conversation compare with the '02 conversation?
F	You called her in 2002, if I recall.
F	Oh, she was here?
F	You've talked about the coaching before, the change from Nigel to Casal/Sanchez, but it seems to have had a pretty profound effect on your results the last six months.  True?
F	Pacific Life likes to call this the fifth major.  How do you look at it?
F	When you turn your back between points and do your ritual of doing some bouncing, reflecting, what is your self-talk to yourself, what is?
F	Have you worked with James Leher?
F	Is that something you picked up from Jim?
F	Watching you play against Peer, I kind of had the feeling that you have this little mantra that you go through after points.  A point, finishing, your feet behind the baseline, faced the other direction from the net --
F	I'm mistaken then, you don't have any little ritual you go through?
F	What was the difference between this match and a couple weeks ago against her?
F	Do you feel like this victory could be kind of a stepping stone for you into a pretty successful season this year?
F	What are your celebration plans?
F	But nothing you can share with us?
F	Champagne on the balloon?
F	In tennis, for pro-players, time is such a funny thing.  You go from tournament to tournament.  Does five years ago, winning this in 2002, does that seem like a long, long time ago or just yesterday?
F	So do you hope to be here in 2012 contending for the title?
F	What's the biggest single difference, psychologically, between a player who wins here and a player who struggles for quite some time?
F	What's been the biggest difference, psychologically, either in your perception of the game or yourself or of your abilities?
F	In those difficult times that you just mentioned, there was so much focus on you about your physical build-ups, that match you played at Wimbledon where you had all those opportunities against Asagoe, and all that, and there was so much focus on you, you looked obviously maybe unhappy.  Was there ever a time when you thought, "Do I really need all this, do I want to continue with this"?
F	Can you take a moment and talk about your role and position in Bratislava and Slovakia?  Are you a really big deal there?  Are you celebrated?
F	Are there other athletes who are equal to you, and if not, who's next in terms of Slovakia athletes?
F	Does this put less pressure on you going into the next couple tournaments or even more pressure now?
F	Now, you feel like you can't wait another five years to win again?
F	What's this match up with the coaches?
F	Which two coaches were that specifically?
F	Why is winning the second one seemingly so much more difficult than winning the first one?
F	Daniela, do you feel now that you're not holding out false hope, that you might some day actually become No.1?  Does this prove to you, yeah, well, I can play big-time tennis again, maybe that's not just a dream?
F	As a junior, at what point did your dream of becoming a tennis professional in your mind become a true reality?  What was the breaking point that you said, "I think I'm gonna get there"?
F	Svetlana obviously had a ton of problems after winning the U.S. Open, which, of course, is a huge, huge event.  And you had your ups and downs after your first win here.  Did you ever have any regrets of your first win coming so early or were you just happy?
F	Does that whale trophy match anything in your home?
M	I suggested to you yesterday you might want to let Nalbandian win the first set?
M	You're welcome.
M	So you were one service break away from retirement?
M	Do they know what it is?
M	Which knee is it, right or left?
M	You're going to play doubles?
M	You lost to Federer the last two years.  Now you might face Roddick.  Do you like your chances are better this time around?
M	If I had to assess the match, it looked like you served bigger and you were 10 to 15 miles an hour faster than he is, put the pressure on him.  Is that a correct assessment?
M	Your history seems to be that except in the Davis Cup, you've played much better in Europe than you have in this country.  Is there any reason, do you suppose, for that?  Have you figured that out?
M	Were you part of the group of 19 top players that signed the letter that was sent to the ITF about moving the Davis Cup?
M	The schedule?
M	Seemed resistant to do that in light of sort of what's been going on with the round-robin.  I'm just wondering what your feelings are?
M	Just leadership in the sport, the ATP.  I mean, are you --
M	Was there an exhibition you played with Goran in Sarajevo?
M	Well, I assume it was emotional for you to go to the old country.  How is Goran, how is he?
M	If you don't mind to follow-up on this, Croatia is doing great in tennis.  Serbia is coming up, too.  What's Bosnia doing?  You were born there.  Just tell --
M	What was the score between you and Goran?
M	Did you play hard?
M	Just getting back to that point about Davis Cup, the argument the ITF puts forward is that by having it straight up against a Grand Slam, there's less chance of getting the big name players to play those earlier rounds.
M	Whereas if there is that week's gap, it gives them a bit of a break, and then there's a bit more of a chance.  What's your view on that?
M	So it would be four, really, because you'd have to go to the semifinals, the semifinal is like the second Friday or the second Saturday?
M	Who misunderstood?
M	I got in here a bit late.  You were talking about your knee.  Did you step wrong or did you --
M	Is that sort of, do you think, the price to be paid for not having lots of match practice?
M	Is that kind of the last thing to come back when you haven't had all the matches, sort of what to do in tight situations or break points or how to take issues?
M	You've had all these time-outs, these were hot conditions out there, two and a half hours, how do you actually feel at the moment?
M	How frustrating was it to be away for three months, given it was December, but the whole absence?
M	When did you play your last match before Vegas, it was Basel?
M	Do your expectations change for Miami or is it still about getting as much practice in?
M	Tim, if you've answered this before, I apologize.  The future of British tennis, now that they're making some changes, some Americans are involved, what's your prognosis?
M	Nice run in doubles, presume to be...
M	Can you talk about what it feels like now to be in your first final a very long time?
M	When you say you thought you did a better job of bluffing your way through it, you mean just showing a little more emotion or energy to psyche him out?
M	Did he look more tired after losing the first set to you?
M	Happy to see him lose a lot of first serves and you were keying off his second serves?
M	There was a moment I think in the second set that he quick served you.
M	Talk about yourself physically.  You were saying that your knees have been bothering you all season but they felt good this week.
M	When you came here last year I believe you said you were hoping to use this as a springboard like James did in 2005.  Is kind of ironic that a year later your words might be ringing true a little bit?
M	If you win this tournament and then go to be top 10 will be writing a book next year?
M	You talked earlier this week about being healthy for the first time in a long time.  Go back through the year.  How did the shoulder injury come about?  I guess we know about the ankle from the field goal.  What's with the knees?  Is it just tendonitis?
M	You called the trainer today.  Was it your arm, shoulder?
M	What would be like if you end up playing James in the final?
M	He says he likes playing his friends and some players don't.  You have the same opinion?
M	Has your friendship gotten stronger because you've helped each other through the adversity?
M	You been getting the support from his following a little bit.
M	Talk about being, you know, able to get a home court advantage, so to speak.
M	Who's doing your laundry tonight?
M	Are you planning to play tactically against James or Mathieu tomorrow?
M	Do you approach a match with a good friend differently?
M	What are James' weaknesses specifically?
M	Sounds like you have a rooting interest.  You'd like to see him get there tomorrow.
M	James can be very focused during a match, talk to himself a lot.  You say you practice against him all the time.  Does he do that in practice, or are you going to see a James that you don't normally see?
M	Being in a final, is it going to change -- do you think tonight's going to be any different than some of the other nights getting to this point?  The preparation, just dealing with the night before the final.
M	How you're going to feel tonight, what you're thinking?
M	You had a very strong Australian Open tune up this season and it obviously paid off.  Are you hoping for the same sort of thing, that everything here is going to bode well when you get to New York?
M	Regardless of whether you win or lose, how mentally prepared are you for the Open?
M	Your girlfriend almost got as much face time as you did.  Are you surprised by that?
M	Do you ever say, Deal or no deal to her?
F	How's your shoulder?  And you were saying you almost didn't play this tournament; is that true?
F	How different was Jelena's mental game compared to the other players you played?  She went after everything you gave her.  Did that push you more or did that kind of worry you?
F	What exactly did they do to your shoulder to make it good?
F	Is it like ice and massage and things like that?
F	How close were you to perhaps pulling out?
F	After losing at Wimbledon, how important was it for you to win the Rogers Cup here?
F	That long 11th game in the second set.  Is that one of the more exciting games you've had before?
F	What did you think of the crowd today?  It was a packed stadium, but there were a few loud mouths, did they disturb you at all?
F	What will you do leading into the US Open?
F	Where do you find the fight on a day like this where, you know, last night you're not sure if you're even going to be able to play?  And there were so many moments in the first set and second set that you had to, obviously, fight back to get back in the match.
F	Today it almost seemed like you were teasing yourself.  You'd get to a point and you'd have a little setback, and come out and dig yourself a little hole.
F	So was it more a matter of just being mentally getting adjusted in that first set or did you make it physical?
F	Is it more rewarding to win a match like this, and fight back in a match like this when the level of tennis is as high as it was today, especially in that 11th game?
F	You've played Jelena so many times over the last year - starting with the semifinals last year at the US Open.  As has her game changed at all or her mental approach changed?
F	Is there anything that wasn't there when you faced her a year ago?
F	What happened out there?
F	One of the other players told us she was tired and there may be too many tournaments. You just won in Los Angeles and flew right here.  Is that a possibility that you may have been tired?
F	Can you just discuss a little bit maybe the difference in pressure that one would feel coming back to try to defend a title?  You didn't get to defend it for very long, but the difference in attitude that you might have coming into that kind of tournament when you're looking to protect your title?
F	What did you know about her before the match?
F	Do you think you underestimated her?
F	Anna Chakvetadze had to withdraw today.  In a tournament that had already been hurt by withdrawals or no shows, how much does someone who is the defending champ going out, and Chakvetadze might have been the hottest player on the tour this year, how much do you think that hurts the tournament?
F	You know that Novak lost today, too?
F	How do you feel that both of you win on Sunday and then?
F	But you didn't know before you went out, I don't think?
F	So it wasn't really sympathy?
F	Do you think that you would be ready for US Open?
F	How unusual is her game, because she hits quite flat and she has the two-handed strokes?
F	I don't know if you know this, but Yan told us, in fact, you are her favorite player so it was a big thrill to play you and I guess beat you?
M	How did you find Stepanek, and are you pleased with the way you played today?
M	Why weren't you able to break him in the first set?
M	When you were down Love-40 in the first set, it just seemed that you just kind of raised your level for a second.  Is that what happened?
M	Any adjustments from the first set to the second set?  Seemed like you were handling a little better in the second set?
M	You may not want to tempt the fates, but is this the best restart that you've had post Wimbledon?  You've played four very good matches, and you seem to be not cruising, but certainly playing to a very high standard.  Is it the quickest and best restart you've had post Wimbledon?
M	No, over all the years?
M	After Wimbledon, is this the best restart you've had?
M	Without Tony, did the practice go in any different way?  Did you do anything different?
M	Players talk about you staying up there three and a half years now at No.1.  Is it a question of maintaining?  Or are you still trying to improve?
M	What do you do for shoes on hard courts?  It is pretty grabby.  Do you have to break them in or do you use a new pair every time?
M	Your possible opponents, if you could analyze the two?
M	You've had two matches.  Does it give you a clearer picture of where you are and what you've got to do?
M	How close or how far away are you?
M	Whichever gives the impression you want to give.
M	Did the win make it more difficult when you're still trying to recover from an injury?
M	Looked like you actually did hit a few more forehands today, opened up a little bit.  Is it feeling better or are you just testing it?
M	How did it feel this morning when you got up?  Better than you thought it might?
M	We're always talking about your wrist, but how is it psychologically?  Are you completely away from the injury?  Can you do what you want to do on the court, forget about the injury?
M	How much treatment do you have to give it after a match, like in the last hour or so?
M	Does it get boring?
M	Do you intend to stay in Montral or heading straight to Cincinnati?
M	"A couple of weeks" suggests you might not play at Cincinnati.  Is that right?
M	Would you risk playing the US Open as the first tournament if you didn't play Cincinnati or New Haven?  Obviously be a lot tougher of a test.
M	I'm sure you're aware, beginning of a huge new phase in your career, you're the brother of a Grand Slam champion.  I'm wondering how that will affect you.
M	Has it gone to his head?
M	Kind of special when you play a guy like him, as good as he has been, he's still a pretty good player?
M	What do you do after Wimbledon to gear up for the US Open part of the year?
M	You seem more focused in the last sort of six months than you were last couple years perhaps.  Is that because you've short of shaken off the injuries, you feel fully fit again?
M	Tony Roche, any effect?  What have you found so far that he's been helpful with?
M	Will you be talking to him after every match you play here?
M	Sometimes sports have a dominant player like Roger or Tiger Woods, they thrive.  But do you think tennis is better off with rivalries or can it thrive with just one player who's clearly dominant?
M	They've been 1-2 now for over two years.  What is it going to take for someone to crack those two?
M	You spent your time at No.1, occupying that space.  Can you express how hard it is to stay at that level with the depth and quality of men's tennis today?
M	You have had some great Australian rivalries back in the day.  In the U.S., sometimes it's hard for people to warm up to a rivalry that doesn't include an American.  Is it the same in Australia?  Is it something that the fans have to grow to understand and appreciate?
M	What did you think changed in the game since you and Juan Carlos were also No.1 in the world?
M	Do you think it's really Roger and Rafael Nadal that came or how the players have approached the game, it's more tough physically now than it was a couple years ago?
M	You talk about Nadal playing better on hard courts.  Is it easier for a clay courter to make that improvement as opposed to a hard court player trying to learn how to play on clay?
M	What is your side of the story of playing doubles with Nadal?  He said yesterday you were talking in the Wimbledon locker room.
M	Said he was a little worried about being able to communicate with you on the court.
M	Work out a code system.
M	With getting married, the injuries, having a kid, being an older player, you're a tremendous competitor.  Can you look back the last five, six years where you dipped maybe a little low in motivation, is that a normal thing that would happen to any player as they mature?
M	Do your expectations change?  When you're floating around 15, 20, even like Juan Carlos, do you sort of have to make readjustments as to where you think you're going to be in the game?  Have you reached that point?
M	Can I ask you about the whole Davydenko betting story?  What was your reaction to it when it came out?
M	Are you surprised by something like that?
F	What was your strategy going into the match?
F	Why didn't you play that well today?
F	It's strange, because you are coming into Top 10 and you turned around?
F	You're not giving yourself much credit?
F	You always tell the truth?
F	Can you explain how you improved so much in one year?
F	You have no coach?
F	Why?  Don't you want to have a coach?
F	Did he teach something special to you?
F	Did you feel flat from the very beginning of the match?  Like could you see that I'm just not feeling like I'm going to have my rhythm today?
F	Did you feel that in the warm-up before the match?
F	What do you expect for the next tournament?
F	In Russia?
F	Just a word about Justine.  She seems to be much less powerful than a lot of other players, and she's No.1.  What has she got that the others maybe don't have?
F	Do you think you can come in the Top 5 this year?
M	A match like that, what can you say about it?  You had the final sets, you had the break, you had points for the double break.  What's your sentiment right now?
M	Maybe you don't know, but you actually won on points.  You had 111 to Caas' 108, so you actually won on points.
M	You had 54 unforced errors.  Could you still think it was a great match?
M	What is it about his game that makes him so difficult to play?  What does he do?
M	What happened on the high volley at 5-5?
M	How much did you think about your defeat two weeks ago?
M	You said the other day that you liked the atmosphere in Miami because the South American fans were very boisterous.  How about the way it was today?  Did you enjoy that atmosphere?
M	Is there any way that you can up the technique, or do you have everything down in your game, it's just a matter of executing it on the day against that particular guy?
M	You've lost four times back to back against people; this is the fifth time.  How do you get out of this?
M	Do you feel that he's less intimidated by you than maybe some higher ranked players?  Do you feel that on the court?
M	(Indiscernible)?
M	In your mind then with the French, were these the two tournaments, despite their level and opponents, that were most expendable for you not to win?
M	Were these the tournaments easier for you not to win going into the French, the clay court season, because they're hard courts?
M	Easier for you.
M	No, easier for you to accept losing.
M	You're usually the crowd favorite almost everywhere you play.  How does it feel?  Is it unusual for you to have the crowd rooting against you?
M	You had a lot of success pressing the ball at the net today.  Do you feel in your mind that in retrospect you could have pressed to the net more?
M	Are you happy with the challenging the calls?  When you challenged a few calls at the line, were you happy with it?
M	Do you think in some way that Guillermo having been away from the tour while you've sort of consolidated your place at the top sort of helped him these last couple of matches?
M	Guillermo's being away, you've consolidated your place at the top has maybe in some way helped him because he's not sort of aware of whatever aura you bring on the court?
M	Your breakpoint conversion today was only 25 percent; you only converted 4 out of 16.  That really hurt you today.
M	Going to the clay season what is your plans about the preparation?  In other words, which tournaments are you planning to play facing the clay season?
F	So where does beating Martina here on center court, where does that rank in your career?  Is that your biggest win, would you say or no?
F	You made it to Wimbledon?
F	Oh, yeah?
F	What did you like about her?  Why was she your favorite player?
F	Where do you train actually?
F	Where do you train?
F	Are there a lot of tennis players in Poland?
F	Domascowska, is she still playing?
F	So do you have a Fed Cup team?
F	Yeah, that should be a pretty good team.
F	What's her name?
F	But younger, one year behind you?  She's one year younger than you?
F	So could you forget that it was Martina across the net?  Did you have to pretend she was not your childhood hero?
F	Was your father here?
F	So he was the one who came to the bench?
F	Was he a player, too?  What's his background?
F	When he came to the bench, did he give you an important piece of information?
F	When he came to the bench as a coach and he talked to you, did he tell you something important?
F	So it was a motivational comment from him?
F	It says in the book, I think, that you're still in high school.  Are you still in school?
F	Studying?
F	Can you be done for the French?  Finished with your exams?
F	So you have your books here with you?
F	Do you have a favorite Grand Slam?
F	You also said you have a pet mouse?
F	Is this true, a mouse?  An actual mouse?
F	Two rats?
F	What are their names?
F	Flippy and floppy?
F	Why would you call two rats Flippy and Floppy?
F	So when you call them, do they come to you?
F	How big?
F	Wow, and you like rats?
F	Did you catch them or buy them?
F	Some people we think of rats as dirty, and like garbage.
F	Like a kitten?
F	They're back home in Poland?  They don't come with you, right?
F	Do they do any tricks?
F	You feed them cheese, of course?
F	But do they like a particular kind of cheese?
F	They're rats?
F	They eat anything.  You don't have a cat or a snake?
F	Where do you live in Poland?
F	What a beautiful city.
F	Have you ever met Wojtek Fibak?
F	When?
F	Was it exciting for you to meet him?
F	What, the greatest polish player ever?
F	Who do you play next?
F	Have you played either of them?  Do you have a preference, either one?
F	Did you play junior, like Orange Bowl or anything here in Miami?
F	How did you do?
M	How disappointing was that match for you?
M	Obviously the wind played a major part in that because obviously I think a lot of your errors, particularly at the net, were caused by the wind maybe holding the ball up a little bit.
M	Do you give some credit to Vince?  It seemed like he played good defense and just kind of waited for you to make the mistake.  Did you feel that way?
M	You guys had split the first four times you played.  What was the difference today from those matches?
M	Is it just not getting enough matches?
M	Such a shame because you looked just fantastic on the courts.  Your dress sense is just perfect:  Your shirt matching the color of the court and everything.
M	What did you think of Vince's wardrobe out there?  It looked like you were playing like a rec player with the stuff he was wearing.
M	Where do you go from here?
M	Given the difficult year you have had, in a way it's important for you to end this year with a win.
M	Did you notice that Gonzlez against Roddick in the last game, he actually fell a couple of times, so did you actually try to use this strategy to move him around the court as well?
M	You said after the opening ceremony you'd attend less tournaments next year.  As the highest ranked Russian player, will you attend Beijing Olympic Games?
M	Talking a little bit about the match, you had many breakpoints, but you didn't convert them.  Is it something with your game or you took a risk?
M	Talking about Davis Cup, do you still have time to recover?  Will you have time to rest?
M	Your backhand volley are really improving quite a bit, really excellent.  Did you do some practice back in the States on these two categories?  Jimmy Connors, your coach, is not here with you.  Did that affect you?
M	We see that you gave your racquet to the fans after you finished the match.  The backs of the board was broken when the fans were fighting for your racquet.  What is your comment on it?
M	You smashed the racquet at the end of the second set and the beginning of the third set, and then you played really good.  Do you think it's any help to smash racquets?  Andre Agassi was the Olympic champion in Atlanta.  Do you ever think to recapture this title for the U.S.?
M	The Olympic title.
M	What do you think of this year's introducing ceremony which resembles the way of introducing NBA players?  How do you like the light and music, the atmosphere?
M	Yes.
M	I saw the captain Patrick McEnroe somewhere in the stadium.  He came here because of you or just to do some television job?  Also in the round table interview you said there's no better preparation for Davis Cup than here.
M	So you defeated the No.1 Russian player, so it's a perfect start for you for the Davis Cup final.
M	Two weeks ago at Bercy, a lot of speculation was going on whether you would come, whether you wouldn't come.  When did you actually make the call and how is the fitness now?
M	With one year of cooperation with Jimmy Connors, do you think you're now a better player than you used to be?  Do you have plans to extend the contract with Jimmy?
M	Davydenko challenged on the last point.  Did it make you worry a little bit?
M	Last year you and James Blake qualified for the Masters Cup.  The year before it was you and Andre Agassi.  This year you're the only American player to play the singles.  The Bryan brothers are not here.  Do you feel a little lonely as the only one American player here?
M	How surprised were you to reach the final?
M	How did you feel after playing so much tennis yesterday?  Did you wake up this morning and feel tired?
M	What are your thoughts about playing somebody who has won the title three times here already?
M	You've come through this draw kind of quietly surprising everybody.  Do you now feel you belong in the top echelons of the sport?  Has that recent experience made you feel like you belong a little bit more?
M	As it stands, even if you win tomorrow, you've got to go to qualifying for Wimbledon, is that right?
M	Your career promised a lot when you were a junior.  You won Wimbledon boy's title.  Because of things that happened off the court that made it difficult for you, your career dipped a little bit.  Do you feel everything is now going the right way again?
M	Can you tell us what you're doing differently this week?
M	Is grass your best surface?
M	What did you think before?
M	You swapped your shirts with Arnaud at the end.  Is this a tradition?
M	You won't do it with Andy tomorrow then?
M	Tell us your feelings as having won that match.
M	Were you surprised to be invited to play in the tournament in the first place?
M	Obviously, Bob Brett twisted a few arms.
M	What actually is Bob doing for you?
M	Do you know exactly how many matches you've played on grass in your career?
M	How do you think Tim played?  Did you feel he was playing with confidence or did you see any problems?
M	Were you especially pleased with the quality of your passing shots today on big points?
M	Do you think you have a chance of figuring in the Croatian Davis Cup team?
M	Is the latest suggestion he might play Wimbledon, Mario?
M	For you in your past, playing Arnaud Clement, David Nalbandian, has helped you to get used to playing?
M	When you woke up this morning, were you expecting a tougher game against Tim?  Did you think you had a chance because his confidence has been low lately?
M	Gulbis beat you at the French Open.  When you're young, your career ahead, do you look at someone like him and expect that everyone expects him to beat you?
F	What made the difference between the first and second and third sets?
F	Why do you think you were nervous?
F	Do you think now because you're not going to be the favorite in the final will you feel less pressure?
F	How much better do you have to play tomorrow to win, regardless of who wins today?
F	Do you root not to have to play the No.1 player in the world?
F	What kind of challenge will it be if it's Venus, knowing she'll have the crowd on her side?
F	When you're struggling like that early and there's nerves, do you move your feet more?  Do you try to hit more spin?  Give yourself margin?  How do you snap out of it?
F	Is it more difficult to get into a rhythm against her?
F	Were you surprised she didn't come out more nervous?
F	Were you expecting a tougher fight in the third set?
F	Do you think your game matches up with one of those guys better than the other?  Do you feel more comfortable against Justine or Venus?
F	You said your win in 2004 seemed very far away.  Is it all coming back to you now?
F	Will you watch this match?
F	How confident are you to win tomorrow?
F	Do you have your hat picked out for your next press conference?
F	Is being No.1 a goal you've had for a long time, or is it more of a target that you're getting close?
F	Does being No.2 sharpen your desire?
F	What is it about the US Open that brings out the best in you?
F	Is it important to give the crowd a smile so they get on your side?
F	We asked your opponent, Peer, what's so good about you.  She said, oh, you'd have to ask Anna, but she couldn't figure it out.  All you do is you win matches.  How are you doing it?
F	Yes.  How are you doing it?  You're not serve and volleying and you're not explosive, but you keep winning you're and No.5 in the world.
F	Excuse me.  You'll be 5.
F	You seem to know though where the ball is.  You anticipate well I would say, because you're there.  When the ball is there you're there.
F	You were talking going into the match that Shahar had given you a very tough match in March.  What did you do to change it around?  Did you change your tactics?
F	How do you learn to play this way?  It's almost like Martina Hingis-type tennis.
F	Had you watched lost the Martina Hingis when you were a junior?
F	You've had two matches with Svetlana Kuznetsova.  Is there a common theme in both of those matches?  Did the matches progress in the same way?
F	Is that the way you felt all season, that you have no pressure?
F	Can you talk about that a bit, because you've made such a great rise.  There must be more expectations?
F	You also always seem to be in a good mood.
F	But is there anything this really gets you down?  You seem so bubbly and happy.
F	You were saying no pressure on yourself depending on how the players you play are, but you're also the type of player if you don't play well you get upset with yourself.  You have high expectations of your own level, correct?
F	Why did you think the crowd -- or feel -- that the crowd was against you?
F	How old were you when you decide that you needed to stop hitting the ball so flat and change tactics a little bit?
F	It a was coach that sat down and talked to you about that?
F	How long did it take to you get comfortable with this new style?
F	You're going into your first Grand Slam semifinal.  What does that mean to you?  This is as if far as you've got in a Slam before.
F	To go out and play under the circumstances you did today with the crowd so in favor of her and you're twenty years of age, to be able to go out in that environment and to play the way that you did and prevail, how do you feel about that in terms of your own development as a player mentally?
F	Your probably answered the question, but why do you think the girls from Eastern Europe are so successful?
F	Are you upset that there are so many players in this tournament in the quarterfinal?  There are six players in the fourth round from Eastern Europe.  Are you upset about this fact?
F	Here's something else you probably never thought about.  Everybody said there's nobody good in the bottom.  Nobody any good down there after Sharapova lost.  What do you think of that, to be among the bottom feeders?
F	Do you think since Wimbledon you maybe have been playing the best tennis on hard courts all summer long, and if you play to your level you should get to the final?
F	Do you think that you will feel no pressure as well on Friday and maybe even Saturday?
F	If there were just a few Russian girls doing well it might be easier for everyone to be close and social.  But there are so many good Russian women on the tour right now.  Does that maybe make in more difficult to get close to people from your own country because you're competing against them all the time?
F	Is Lansdorp coming now?
F	How much has he been helping you?
F	Did you visit him or...
M	They always say these long matches come down to just a handful of points, maybe just one point.  Can you go over the lob point with us a little bit.
M	When you hit the second lob at 3-3, did you know it was going to be a winner?
M	Do you think earlier in your career maybe getting down and having him playing as well early would have thrown you off?  Maybe the way you came back in this game shows what you've learned.
M	Could you speak about the emotion of having the last point be subject to replay?  You sort of made a slight smile, but it was hard to read the emotion.  Did you know when to celebrate?
M	Three match points to defend.  You were very aggressive on all three.  Is that just experience, veteran player out there?
M	You bounced back from so many injuries in your career:  Shoulder recently, abdominal muscle.  How do you kind of keep going back to coming back from injuries?
M	What were you thinking in the fifth set tiebreak?  Did you feel nervous or you tried to play more aggressive or more safe?
M	Do you like the fifth-set tiebreaker as opposed to playing it out?
M	It is part of your game plan to approach shots to James' backhand side, get to the net.  Do you feel like you executed that?  Was it a big key?
M	James told us a moment ago that after he had his injuries and family tragedy, when he was making his comeback, that he looked at you or looked to you as kind of a role model or inspiration for making that work.  My question is, were you at all aware of what he was going through?
M	And did you have any feeling of empathy?
M	How tired are you?
M	No IV?
M	No intravenous?
M	Tougher than the match at the Australian Open?
M	What pleased you most about your performance today?
M	Match point against you, David comes forward, easy backhand, muy facil?
M	What are you thinking of?  Are you thanking God or something at that point?
M	You've got Nadal coming up next.  What do you expect and how can you beat him?
M	Why are you such a good fighter?
M	But were you always like that when you were a little boy?
M	Because you were born like that?  Do you think it's inside you?  In your family you were the little fighter all the time?
M	Some other players are not so good like you for fighting.  You were better.
M	Do you think that because you are such a fighter and because you can stay on the court so long that when someone plays you, particularly on clay, you already have an advantage because they know how physically strong you're going to be in the match?
M	You are one of the best service returners in tennis, and two weeks ago in New Haven you played John Isner, who's a big story here for America.  What did you think of him?  You beat him, of course.  You lost the first set.  But what's your opinion of John Isner's game?
F	Today was a very tough day for seeds in your half of the draw.
F	By the time your match started, both Nadia Petrova and Maria Sharapova had left the drew with losses.  Did that play in your mind at all today?
F	You make an interesting point.  It seems that the media, myself included, seemed to not give enough credit to the more unknown younger players coming up.  Seems like there's two-tier system.  Hingis and Williams and now the Jankovic and Ivanovic and Henins, and then there's a bunch of other people that seem in the first early rounds they go.  Are we missing something completely?
F	You're smiling a lot this year.  What's going on?
F	You won the first 10 games, then lost a game, and you looked awfully unhappy then.
F	When you play three opponents in the first week, all of whom are ranked in the 100's, certainly professional players, but not players that are going to push you very hard, can it leave you sharp enough for the second week?
F	Will any of your family be here for this tournament?
F	Est wearing a watch ever bother you on court?
F	What kind of watch?  It's a Rolex, right?
M	Can you talk about your performance today, how happy you were with how you played.
M	How did you find the conditions out there today?
M	Just talk about the crowd in New York, the atmosphere at this particular tournament.
M	You must be very pleased with that.
M	How long has it been since you've played that well?
M	Must have been nice not to have gone out in a straight-sets defeat today.
M	Is there any sense that there's a release, having done what you've done, your approach is slightly different?
M	Compared to other wins in your career, what degree of satisfaction do you get from this?
M	Can I add on a fashion note?  JP will be spinning in his grave seeing you after such a good win wearing Cambridge blue.
M	Earlier today Marat Safin said that when he looks back on his victory here, he kind of thinks, So what?  It was in the past, nobody cares.  I'm wondering what you think of that when you look back on your career?  Do you think people do care?
M	He's saying he doesn't want to live in the past; that you have to live in the present.
M	You will play against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.
M	Has the back settled down a little bit?
M	What do you have to do when you go off court?  What have you had done to you?
M	Since you've announced your retirement, have you had many messages from other people within the game or people that aren't around any more, Andre, Pete?
M	Any ones that surprised you?
M	As someone who has had to endure your share of aches and pains as you've gotten older, is it worrisome to see a young star like Nadal hobbling so much at this point in the season?
M	10 years ago when the tennis world, as usual, gathered here for the US Open, word came in about the tragic death of Princess Di.  Can you reflect on the impact it had for you.
M	What do you think we can expect of Andy Murray at this tournament?
M	You practiced with Roger Federer last week.  What did you talk to each other about?  Could you share that with us?
M	What are some of the things you think Delic needs to tighten up in his game?
M	Is this as good as you've felt on the court, off the court, health-wise, coming into a Slam in a while?
M	Look like you're enjoying it more than you have in a while.  Is that a consequence of all the results?
M	Your video conference call with Rochey you're going to have, did he tell you to get to the net?
M	Obviously making more approaches to the net.  You were quite successful at it today.
M	You seemed to vary your service speed a bit today.  Was that part of the strategy, not let him settle in?
M	When you've been through some changes, does having been No.1, having won slams, does that really help you in a first or second round, or does that put more pressure on you?
M	How long ago does 2001 seem for you?  How different are you?  Where do you regard your career right now, what you want to do?
M	Faith is a strange word to use in terms of tennis matches.  Do you have faith you're going to win another Slam?
M	The last match you played against Roger, does that give you that bit more confidence that you're getting closer there?
M	Are you travelling with wife and child?
M	What is that like?
M	Any bothers?  Any traumas?
M	Sleeping well, doesn't bother you?
M	I can see in your face you're enjoying it.
M	What do you learn from her?
M	Yes.
M	Has being a father brought something to your career?
M	Do you think she's mellowed you out a it?
M	Has she made you a better person?
M	When you talk about Roger, playing the big points with such confidence, presumably there was a time when you did the same thing.  Do you have a memory when you felt you were on top of the world?
M	I don't know Patrick Rafter's status in terms of where he lives.  Would you ever call up Rafter and have a hit with him or would he call you?
M	Wouldn't want to call him up, see what he can do?
M	What happens when you play golf?
M	Obviously there's been stuff about gambling, questions about that on tour this summer.  Paul Goldstein yesterday said he'd been contacted.  You're a long-time guy.  Had you ever had any contact or any thinking during a match something weird is going on or do you think it's a one-off situation?
M	Do you actually think it's a problem that must be dealt with strongly?
M	You arranged special practice in regard to Delic's serve.  How did that help you today?
M	Having Darren around you, encouraging you, at the time when he used to coach you till now, has he sort of changed the way he looks at thing, given you advice from when he was with Agassi?
M	Are those things that have helped you in your game?
M	What did you alter in your receiving position against Delic?
M	When you were no longer No.1, did it take a mental adjustment to not be disheartened?
M	You weren't discouraged?
M	You've obviously handled some great servers in the history of the game.  Some people have said Isner's is one of the best already.  Where do you place it?
M	On the coaches front, you have access to Darren, Rochey, two of the best in the business.  Is it fair to say you've got the best deal in tennis at the moment?
M	Having a look forward now, you have Seppi or Calleri.  Talk about the challenges they bring.
M	Tim said a couple days ago he could see a situation arising when there were seven-foot tennis players.  Do you think there's a chance people of your stature physically will never have a chance of challenging for major titles in the land of the giants this sport seems to be becoming?
M	How is the shoulder?
M	How is the left leg?
M	What were the emotions when you walked out on court at the US Open?
M	When was the last time you were nervous about anything?
M	How long do the nerves last, and how do you get rid of them?
M	In Washington after every match you said you were just stunned with yourself.  Is it getting a little old hat now?  Settling into winning?  Is it still amazing for you?
M	How do you like the court speed here?
M	Compared to Washington?
M	Critical point in the match, 5-5, tiebreak, third set.  He double-faults.  Some guys would overhit the first serve.  You hit an ace.  What were you thinking?
M	Didn't overhit it?
M	Conventional wisdom has been that college players can't make it on the ATP Tour.  Obviously you're the exception to that.  What do you say to that?
M	It almost seems sometimes as if the serve is a neglected stroke in some ways because of people playing from the baseline.  There's a lot of talk about the racquets changing so the returners have a big advantage, yet it's so foundational to the game, being able to hold serve, the serve.  Do you think the stroke has been neglected the past couple years?
M	He said that it was the hardest serve for him to return, even your second serve.  Can you expound on what you consider your serve, how you would describe it?  Is it really fun to hit?
M	Jarkko reached the quarterfinals here two years ago.  You took him out in the first round.  What does today mean to you, your confidence, your career?
M	How much of your family are here and how many Bulldogs are here?
M	Could you hear them out there?
M	Stephen Bass was playing in the qualifiers, and he said you used to travel around in the juniors to tournaments.  Do you have memories of travelling around with him?  Do you talk to him still?
M	You're a victory away from playing Federer.  Have you given that any thought?  What might you have thought about that a month or so ago?
M	Did you see any of his match today?
M	Were there Americans in the locker room to greet you when you came in this afternoon?
M	Who was there?
M	How excited were they?
M	How important was it to save all the breakpoints today?  Time and time again you got yourself in trouble and had your big serve, got out of trouble with it.
M	Do you know anything about De Voest, the next player you're going to be playing?
M	Rik De Voest.
M	You had a great deal of doubles success in college.  How important is that on the tour, to play doubles?  How does it help your game?
M	Last week you played one of the service returners in men's tennis, David Ferrer.  What did you take out of that match?
M	Are you learning anything from him?
M	Most guys opt for college because they feel they're not physically or mentally ready.  If you had to rank those, where would you say you needed to do the most work?  Was it on the mental side or physical development?
M	What was your height and weight when you started school?
M	Do you think you received a bit of karma when Jarkko hit the umpire, too?  Broke him a point later.
M	Did the blister really have an affect on you?
M	Has he been playing as well, in your mind, as he has the last couple years?
M	Did you expect him to be playing so well today?
M	Did you feel any carryover from the match yesterday in the heat?
M	When you took the medical time out, how much did you think about just retiring from the match at that point?
M	Next year the schedule a really tight with the Olympics after Wimbledon and the US Open.  Is it a lot for a player?  You've experienced it before, but is it almost too much with the big tournaments, do you think?
M	Obviously with this and Toronto being back to back do you have to go through a process of deciding which tournament is more important to go to between here and Toronto?
M	Where do you think this tournament leaves you going forward now when you've got the Open coming up?
M	Did you hurt yourself during the match?
M	So even before the match started you felt something was wrong?
M	When did to get really bad during the match, the way you felt?
M	Started very bad?
M	That's odd, because I thought maybe the first round bye might help you coming from Montreal.
M	Why did you retire when you did?  Did you think you would be able to finish?
M	Was the dizziness worse or the arm?
M	Was your arm in pain or was it just tight?
M	It seemed to really affect you on your forehand, your arm.  Was it worse on that side or no?
M	It's just the bad luck, so to speak, sort of continues here for you in Cincinnati.  How frustrating is it for you to play this tournament?
M	Will you head to New York to prepare for the Open or what are your plans now?
M	Did you feel some pain during the warm up this morning?
M	Did it take you a little bit of time to settle down and figure out how you wanted to play him?
M	Was the week off good for you at all?
M	When you initially got hurt last week were you concerned that this could be a lingering thing?
M	Heading into your next match do you think you'll forget about it and play normal?
M	Were you a ball boy in New Haven?
M	What kind of tournaments?
M	What was that experience like for you?
M	I've spoken to a lot of the ball kids here and they say that you say, Thank you a lot.  Do you take pride in being polite on the court?  Does that come from having been a ball boy?
M	When did you decide to become a famous author?
M	You said it took about a year.  When was the start to finish time?
M	Anything in particular you hope people get from it?
M	When you play in Rome or Hamburg or Stockholm do you still say thank you?
M	What is you hope for this week?  I know you want to prepare for the Open, and be healthy for that, but what's your hope for this week?
M	How much did the match you played yesterday and your ankle today affect you?
M	Do you think it was fair that they made you play at 12:00?
M	Were you able to speak with anybody from the All England Club to tell them you were unhappy?
M	Can you tell us about your injury.
M	During the first set you were certainly playing as well as Roger.  You had a good chance.
M	Has this run this year given you confidence you can come back next year and win sometime in the future?
M	Will you play a tournament next week?
M	Presumably this last week has been your most bizarre spell at a Grand Slam.
M	What have you been doing during your surprise holiday?
M	Did it give you a lot of time to think about what you were trying to do here?
M	Do you feel the pressure of defending the title now or was it an easy match for you?
M	Did you feel dissociated from the tournament, not being around?
M	You seemed to find your game in the third set.  What did you go through after losing the second?
M	Even your uncle is here from South Africa.  What has the family support been like?
M	What do you make of the level of criticism that the club has taken from some other players about scheduling, not playing Sunday?
M	Could you comment on your upcoming opponents.  You haven't played Andy since the Australian Open.  Gasquet has given you a bit of fight in the past.
M	The Australian Open final, do you consider that an aberration in terms of your and Andy's career series and how one-sided it was?  Was that a very severe exception to the rule in your matches?
M	Does Borg's presence here for the weekend add pressure or more incentive for you?
M	Do you have a cold or sounding a bit nasal?
M	Rafael Nadal's progress in this tournament, so opposite to your experience.  Have you analyzed the different effects it might have on both of you?
M	Have you read the comments from Pete Sampras about the style of play in this era, the lack of net play?  If you have, do you have any comment on that?
M	What did it feel like yesterday after so many days of not playing when you did finally get on the court and hit the first ball?
M	Can you talk us through the mental process after the second set.  It was almost like you flipped a switch and went back to being the best player in the world.  Was losing that set a wake-up call?
M	Is there a certain pressure from history trying to catch guys who aren't even playing any more?
M	Tommy Haas when he pulled out said he could have been dangerous for you.
M	How do you feel?
F	Are you more surprised for the final reached in Paris or the semifinal reached here?
F	The first time on Centre Court, did it strike you how far you've come since the swimming pool?
F	What are your thoughts and emotions as you walk onto this court for the first time?
F	You looked more emotional at the end than you have at the end of some of your previous matches.
F	Out of those three match points, which one do you think she should have played better or do you think it was you playing very well, those three?
F	What were you wearing on your knee?
F	Just normal strapping?
F	Was there an injury of some sort?
F	How hard is it to play aggressively on match points?  Many young players on match points will play nervous.  The two you took, you played super aggressive.
F	You said you were nervous at the beginning.  Centre Court, is that what made you nervous?
F	What is your take on the crowd at Centre Court, the whole Wimbledon experience so far?
F	Are you surprised by that?
F	Novak is through also.  Serbians have had a fantastic run this year.  Why the breakout this year?  Did they change the water supply?
F	Do you think what you went through as a country has given strength?
F	Does the story line of it ever amaze you?
F	What changed once you came back from Paris in Serbia towards you, towards Djokovic?  Do they write much more about tennis than before?
F	Thoughts on the semifinal?
F	Being in the final in Paris, then in semifinal here at Wimbledon, totally different conditions, how did you manage to adapt to these new conditions within two weeks?
M	With all the rain we've been having this week, it must be quite a relief for you to have your match over in the space of one day.
M	Was the third set a problem for you?
M	Did you feel you improved with each set?
M	Was there anything about your game that was particularly pleasing today?
M	Is it any more difficult for you playing another French opponent?
M	How far do you think you can go now?
M	What are your thoughts on Andy this tournament?  Have you been impressed with the way he's playing?
M	Will you be doing anything in particular to try to beat him?  Will you change your tactics at all?
M	How have you been killing time in the locker room?  What do you to when it's raining?
M	Yes.
M	Did you make new friends in the locker room?
M	How do you find Nadal in the locker room?
M	Why are there so many French players at Wimbledon and hardly any British players?
M	You're the only French player left in the men's draw.  Does that put more pressure on you?
M	What were your expectations coming into the tournament?
F	When you went over when Serena was down on the ground, what did you think was wrong with her?
F	How difficult did you keep your concentration on Serena's cramp?
F	When it started to rain, what went through your mind?
F	The longer one.
F	As the third set went on, what did you think of her injury situation?
F	You don't think you had any advantages in the third set?
F	How will you remember this match?
F	What about the opportunity that you had there?  What was going through your mind when you saw she was clearly not herself?
F	Serena said when you hit the dropshot she got fired up.  Do you have any thoughts or comments about that?
F	I think the first one after her injury.
F	I believe so.
F	She said she would do the same thing.
F	In terms of strategy, did you have to think about any strategy based on her condition?
F	Have you had this kind of situation in your career before, somebody injured, you have to deal with it?
F	What advice did you get from your coach in terms of how to play Serena with her injury?
F	What were you thinking when you walked to her?
F	Was this a match that Serena won or that you lost?
F	You may be aware that the WTA announced today a number of things, including Qatar, Istanbul, and changed the scoring rules for doubles.
F	On the scoring rules, scoring will be just like the men do now:  no-ad scoring in doubles with a super tiebreak in the third set.  Do you have any views?
F	What does it feel like to move through Wimbledon so quietly?  Do you prefer it that way?
F	11 games in 2 hours and 8 minutes on court.  Pretty impressive.
F	Have you played Centre Court this year so far?
F	You played the last couple matches on the outside courts?
F	Is there much talk in the changing rooms today about what's happened in central London with the bomb that was found?
F	Does it make you nervous about being here?
F	Apart from tennis, do you have any special abilities or party tricks you're able to pull out when you're not on the court?
F	Have you noticed any other players that do?
F	Amlie Mauresmo has sort of struggled this year.  You played her very recently.  How would you assess her level?  Do you consider her in the top group of players that can win this tournament?
F	Do you ever allow yourself to think about what it would be like to win here?
F	Would the achievement be more than winning the French Open for you?
M	Was that a step up for you today?
M	Is it good to maybe conserve a bit of energy at this stage of the tournament, get an easy one under your belt like that?
M	I suppose you don't quite know when you will be playing.  As it turned out, you haven't been affected by it.  Is it important to get your rest days?
M	Do you feel at this stage that your game is as sharp as it has been coming into a Wimbledon?
M	Of all the things that pleased you, was the second serve one of them?
M	Four aces in a game.
M	The match is not finished yet, but Caas or Mirnyi, what you'd have to do against them?
M	If it is Mirnyi, how big a difference does it make when you play from the back court trying to pass him, just his wingspan?  How different is it from playing a normal-sized player?
M	What does that mean, comes in on junk?
F	Are you happy with that?
F	When you feel yourself doing that during the set, you're not the same in the first, but you can't change it?
F	Seemed almost to be more frustrated with yourself than with the challenge in front of you.  Was that the case, particularly during the second set?
F	We all know how competitive you are.  If you were to take eight to ten weeks off and just get rid of the shoulder problem, you'd miss the US Open, a lot of tennis that you don't want to miss.  But thinking long range, why isn't that the best solution for you?
F	If after taking those three weeks off you work diligently on that, by the time San Diego, Stanford, you don't feel any significant improvement, will you rethink what you want to do?
F	You're so young, so much career ahead of you.  Is there an endangerment this will linger on for two or three more years?
F	You could take another shot at some point this year if you needed it mid summer, the fall?
F	Because?
F	Are you able to play around the shoulder now?  Are you used to the pain?  You can say that you'll rip big serves, go all forehand, forget about the pain, that's what you need to do during the match?
F	What would Yuri like you to do?
F	You really did look like a swan in that dress.
F	Do you identify with swans in some way?
F	You made a point of it being a sort of a swan-inspired dress.
F	Do you feel some sort of kinship with the bird?
F	They are a protected bird here.
F	Do you think they have a hawk here?
F	They have a real hawk patrolling the grounds every day at 9:00.
F	Is it your favorite dress from all the dresses they made for you?
F	Basically other than everything, which is the expected response, what has to work for you specifically in order for you to win the tournament, what part of your game?
F	Is it mind over matter with your shoulder the way it is?
F	Does it make it that much harder to be confident when your shoulder's in the state it is?
F	At the French Open I saw your dad laughing and smiling.
F	Can you talk about him.  We really don't know that much about your dad.
F	Does his humor come from his innocence or love of life?
F	That was close, wasn't it?
F	What is your overriding emotion after coming through it then?
F	Did you know anything about Naomi before, and were you impressed with her?
F	Are you surprised at the strength of the opposition?
F	Yes.
F	Can you talk about your struggles the last five weeks, what went into your thought process coming in here, whether you were going to play or not?
F	So 60 or 70%, do your expectations change coming in here?
F	It's the 10-year anniversary of your win here.  I know you're not at your best right now, but can you reflect on what it means to you now to try to contend for major wins?
F	Is it important for you to consider yourself in contention, somebody that can still contend for Grand Slam titles?
F	What was going through your mind when you had two match points down?  You have had some first-round disappointments in the past.
F	What's the Czech saying?
F	Give it a go.  What's the gist of it?
F	What does it mean?
F	Were you actually in discomfort when you were playing today?  Were you actually in some pain?
F	Does it seem like 10 years ago that you were 16 years old and smiling all the time, schooling all the other players, winning this title?  Does it seem like that long ago now?
M	In your wildest dreams, did you expect such a victory?
M	What worked for you tonight?  What did you like about your game?
M	Is there a point where you're saying, This is ridiculous; this just can't go on?
M	So you never played this well anywhere against anyone at any level than what you played tennis?
M	You never played anywhere, against anyone, at this level of tennis?  You've never done this kind of thing before?
M	How do you explain it?  It's unbelievable, but how?  Why?  How do you explain that can happen?
M	Can you keep this level up for just one more match?
M	Has the fact that you've had to come back from so many injuries given you more motivation to reach the highest level?
M	Were there times when you thought in your head you'd be able to do it, but physically your body wouldn't allow you to get to this level of tennis?
M	Were there times when you had fears that your body, because of the injuries, wouldn't allow you to get to this level of tennis, even though in your mind you knew you could play at this level?
M	So walk us through what it's like to play tennis like that.  I mean, do you see every ball in slow motion, or is the whole thing a blur?  What is it like being out there when you can do that?
M	You seemed to know where his shots were going.  Every shot he made you seemed to know where it was going before he hit it.  Did you feel that way tonight, that you just guessed right every single time?
M	Against Youzhny at the end you looked a little bit nervous.  But tonight did you feel the same at the end when you were serving for the match?  Were you calmer this time?
M	Were you expecting a different reaction from Nadal on court?  I mean, you were surprised by yourself, but were you also surprised by the fact that he wasn't...
M	Why do you think you haven't produced tennis anywhere near this level up until really now?
M	Because you've never been this far in a major tournament, is it challenging trying to plan out what you do between now and Sunday's final?
M	How are you going to spend the next two days?  What will you be doing?
M	How important was the crowd tonight?
M	If you play this well again on Sunday night, do you think either Federer or Djokovic can beat you?
M	Do you think you played at such a high level the last couple of days, particularly tonight, that your nerves in a sense haven't really been tested in a really tight situation because you played too well to get into that situation?
M	Why was it so different from the game in Shanghai?
M	In the end you had the opportunity to change the momentum?
M	What makes him so tough to play, Djokovic?  Is it an overall thing?  The serve?  The legs?
M	Is he ready to win this tournament?  Has he got the ability to win this tournament now?
M	And your opinion on Tsonga?  Is it a surprise for you?
M	But Rafa is the favorite in the game?
F	Your best ever Grand Slam win?
F	Is that your best ever Grand Slam win?
F	What did you like about your game?
F	Congratulations.  You served for the match.  Did you get a little shaky in that game?
F	Do you think you played your best tennis ever, or do you think we can see even better?
F	I bet you remember your first match here and now you're sitting here.  Did you say a little prayer?
F	Must give you incredible motivation.
F	Did you feel as if Serena was wounded in any way?  Were you surprised at how slowly she started the match, especially?
F	How injured are you?
F	Are you seriously hurt somewhere in your body?
F	All that twisting the trainer does with your leg, does that give you relief, or are you going to have to get a new leg before the tournament is over?
F	You almost lost in the first round and you struggled through most of your rounds.  How do you explain sort of your more solid performance today?
F	Did you feel less pressure?  Did you feel like the underdog?
F	How did you obtain such mental toughness?  Were you born with it, or have you worked on it?
F	Have the aches and pains subsided at all for you, or because you're playing they haven't had the chance to heal yet from the start of tournament today?
F	It could be Justine again?
F	Are you able to breathe better now that you've had the nasal surgery?
F	You said you were looking forward to your day off.  Is there anything that takes your mind off tennis during those nearly 48 hours?
F	Your best ever performance at a Grand Slam tournament.  How did it feel?
F	You had a couple breaks of serve in the first set with a chance of winning that.  What went wrong?
F	How did you rate Venus' performance today?
F	Do you think she's got what it takes at the moment to win this week?
M	Can you describe the injury, when it first occurred.
M	Was there a particular shot where it got worse or just bad all the way through?
M	So you're saying right from the start of the match, you didn't think you had a chance with the injury?
F	What are your thoughts on that?
F	She's beaten quite a few top players.  What is it about her game that's so difficult?
F	Were you not feeling okay, or was something wrong?
F	You say you weren't thinking right.  What were you thinking then?
F	Is it mental pressure that got to you?
F	You handled pressure in Grand Slams so well before on many occasions.  Why was that different?
F	She played with no pressure whatsoever.  She seemed to be a lot more freer than you were.  Is it just a case of her being young and not having experienced that before, that she was just enjoying the moment, and you were feeling the pressure because she was playing so freely?
F	Did you feel anything unusual before you got on the court?
F	Do you think she's a special young talent?
F	We saw you playing a very good final in Sydney against Justine.  How tough is this loss to take?
F	Your third straight-sets win in a row.  What are your thoughts on today's match?
F	Any aspect of your game that you're really happy with?
F	She's just not quite as consistent as you are, huh?
F	You know Dementieva really well, your next opponent.  She had a quick win today in a match that could have gone long against Peer.  Should be a tough matchup.
F	Your father doesn't wear the hoodie anymore.  Is he feeling better?
F	If Nike would pay me enough money, I would do it.
F	The first week has pretty much passed for you now.  Tough second-round matchup.  Going into next week, looking ahead, it will get pretty rough.  The draw isn't that easy.
F	Considering how much you focused on trying to get ready to beat Lindsay, do you feel you had any sort of hangover from that at the beginning of the match today, being able to get focused and into it?
F	In the past sometimes they said equal prize money was not fair because women were winning too easily.
F	In these days it's happened that the top eight players have won all their matches very easily.  I mean, there were seven 6-Loves and there were only two men two sets love.
F	The professor would like to know if now you believe women should be paid more than men?
F	Are you intending to come with the Russian team in the Fed Cup to Israel?
F	For sure?
F	The Israeli crowd is expecting you very much.
F	You know Dementieva beat the two Israelis pretty easily.
F	What do you think about your chances?
F	Today Jankovic got a warning because her mother apparently was coaching her.  She said it wasn't true, so on.  Do you remember when your father had the warning for the same reason, or if he ever had?
F	Do you remember when was the last time?
F	Maybe so.
F	I'll tell you later.
F	It was against Camille Pin.  Very hot conditions.
F	Was today the first time you got a time code warning?
M	How does that stack up?  Is that the best one of your career?
M	Can you talk about the difference today as opposed to the other two times you played him?
M	Did you feel like you got under his skin?  Seemed pretty irritated.
M	You have a pretty big challenge come up.
M	Break that down.  I know you haven't had too much time to think about it yet.
M	Has he done a imitation of you yet?
M	How do you get from sort of struggling at the challenger level to like this is a major?  How do you explain that?
M	Yeah.
M	You had a real specific game plan for your offseason, if I remember right.  Can you talk about that?
M	What sort of things were particularly difficult?  What did he have you doing?
M	In all seriousness, did you add muscle?
M	Feel stronger?
M	Which beach was this?
M	Do you feel mentally you're ready to beat a guy like Djokovic?
M	What is it about this tournament that you seem to like so much?
M	It's a long way to go.  Does it feel good to you and feel comfortable?
M	Does it feel Californian to you?
M	Who you hanging with playerwise when you're in the tournaments?  Who do you spend some time with?
M	You guys going out to dinner together in the evening?
M	The statistics showed there wasn't very much between the pair of you.  Where do you think you won it?
M	You looked as if you were out of the match in the third and fourth sets.  How did you get back in the fifth?
M	Does this win set you up nicely for the rest of the tournament?
M	Have you been foot-faulted that many times before?
M	Seemed to worry you a bit.
M	How much do you think it may have taken out of you physically?
M	Do you prefer the night session?
M	What is your record against Lleyton?  How many times have you played him?
M	How do you feel you play against Hewitt?  Does your game suit his game?
M	I thought it might be your home game on Saturday night.
M	The Greeks in the stands.
M	You had ice on your elbow at Kooyong after one of the matches.
M	You said you were working on your serve also at Kooyong.  Tonight the percentage was very consistent.
F	Was that second set a wakeup call?
F	Is it always a problem, motivation a problem in your game?
F	What do you make of the incident last night with the Capsicum spray and the police?
F	So it doesn't dent your view of the tournament?
F	Larry Scott talked the other day a little bit about provisional suspensions with doping, so between the first sample and the second sample, instead of waiting until the B sample comes back instead of announcing provisional suspensions earlier.  I'm wondering if you feel like the way the doping protocol is set it takes too long between when a player tests and they're notified?
F	For instance, if Martina Hingis, she tested in July and she found out in September it came out.  It's a long time.
F	Do you feel a player should be suspended before their side's been heard?
F	We all know that Wimbledon is very important to you, but could you talk about the significance of this Slam for you, given the fact you were gone last year and the year before you had to retire?
F	How much did you watch last year, if any, of this tournament?
F	Nothing?
F	Was it deliberate?  Did you feel you would miss it too much if you watched?
F	7-5, 6-3.  Easy win, but wasn't that easy on the court.
F	Second set was close.
F	Are you happy with your performance today?
F	Who do you prefer in the next round?
F	How good are you prepared for this Grand Slam?
F	You use this racquet before, or is the first time?
F	What is the difference in the racquet from the one you had before?
F	Are you using the same strings?
F	You had a tough match, and yet Novak Djokovic said today you can say the top 5 or top 10 players are going to get through easy like in the women's draw.
F	So you have to blame Novak for saying it?
F	Has Novak ever tried to copy you and your moves on court?
F	What is the latest gossip?
F	Because you blame us for being too late with the gossip.
F	How much pressure have you put on yourself for the next two weeks?
F	Does it feel like what happened in the first set, that was the case, you maybe put too much pressure on yourself?
F	How do you keep yourself focused when you're not at Melbourne Park?
F	How do you assess your form today as a first-round match?
F	How do you compare your form now with this time last year when you made the final?
F	How much is this week about getting the business done, getting into the next week?
F	Do you have a different mindset week one to week two?
F	How many months have you been completely physically healthy and what's the prognosis now?
F	The constant worry you were having last year week to week about the shoulder, that's pretty much gone away?
F	Lindsay is not your typical first-week opponent.  Can you comment on how you see that shaping up?
F	Is that what worked for you?  You have a good record against her.
F	When you saw the draw, did you say, Ouch, how come I'm the unlucky one getting her?  There's not too many floaters who were Grand Slam champs in the draw.
F	Lindsay spoke about being more aggressive when she plays you.  Is that the way you'll approach that match as well?
F	Lindsay was mentioning getting woken up early in the morning by the baby crying.  Could you imagine going about the career, getting woken up at 5 a.m., dealing with the baby, going back to sleep?
F	So when you walked onto the grounds after Asia, thinking about last year...
F	Were you pretending you were here for the first time?
F	Looking ahead, what were you thinking about this tournament, what you felt like you could do, what you wanted to do?
F	Did that match against Justine at the Championships help you turn the corner?
M	What did you make of the match?  Give him a good run for his money?
M	You seemed to get quite edgy out there at times.  Can you talk about that?
M	When you dropped the serve to lose those sets, did he up his game or are you disappointed with the way you played?
M	You must have been pleased with the way you handled his serve, generally.
M	Yes.
M	Were you happy with the behavior of the crowd?
M	Was it intimidating or frustrating or both playing against a guy whose serve digs him out of trouble time and time again?
M	You're somebody that always seems more than willing to learn.  What have you learned from today and this whole experience?
M	Do you think if you got into the top hundred you'd stay up there?
M	How do you think your game has come in the last three months?
M	Was there a bit of ill feeling at the end there?
M	So you said to him...
M	There were words exchanged?
M	These are lessons you're learning?
M	You should have gone with him.
M	So what now?
M	Going home?
M	How much have you thought about Davis Cup and Argentina?
M	Has it been a real incentive to you over the last few weeks, the thought you could get a singles place for that match?
M	It's often been difficult for British players who come through qualifying, lose in the first or second round, get themselves back up on what can be a very tedious circuit.  Do you feel confident you'll be able to do that?
M	Judging from the previous years you've been on the challenger circuit, where do you think you'll be able to make the biggest push?
M	Where and when if you like?
M	Do you feel you've packed an awful lot into what has been quite a short time here, which will last you massively into the coming season?
M	He was able to get to the net a lot in this match. Unusual for clay. Were you surprised about that?
M	People say that the clay of Rome is much faster than other tournaments. Do you feel like that helped him to serve and get to the net and keep you back?
M	Who's the favorite for the tournament this year?
M	After Nadal lose?
M	Is it fair to say there was a little bit of everything out there tonight?
M	He's probably quite tough to play against, isn't he, very talented ball-striker?
M	Did you feel by the time he suffered his mishap you were getting on top?
M	Can you just take us through the one or two controversial things that happened out there? I think we get the gist of the first one, but the second one when you and Fergus were having quite a long conversation about something we thought involved Juan Martin.
M	Apparently Sky was saying it was something to do with your mother. That's what the microphones picked up.
M	You wouldn't appreciate that, I guess.
M	Did you complain to the umpire about that?
M	Have you got on okay with him prior to this?
M	In a sense can it get you almost fired up for the rest the tournament, something like that?
M	I mean, because you came from behind quite a lot tonight.
M	How do you feel about your next opponent, Wawrinka?
M	Do you think clay is one of his better surfaces.
F	There are so many ways to find out the form. This is one of the ways, just to start a little bit slowly and then to find out, or you have some problems with your forehand or something?
F	(From Italian) You're a public figure and everybody loves you. You have lots of fans. Your public wants to know if in your life you have room for your private life as well, perhaps a boyfriend, or whether you usually prefer to keep this a secret and private?
F	When you play someone like Wozniacki, can you remember when you were 17 and which sort of feeling do you have? I don't think you can feel old, but in some way do you feel old?
F	Looking ahead to the French Open, what do you expect from the Williams sisters? I always find that a little tough to judge where they're at. What are your thoughts?
F	Bye-bye No.1 in the world now. If you have to pick just one opponent, do you pick Serena an Ivanovic? One opponent of yours, like No.1 in the world you are today. So is it Serena or someone else, like first opponent? The best opponent of you. Do you think it's Serena or Ivanovic?
F	(From Italian) You always play seems like with extraordinary intensity, and it's very exciting to watch you. Were you always so involved since you were a child, or was there a moment in your career, perhaps when you were training in Bradenton, in Florida, where you said, From today I'm going to be more aggressive and more emotionally involved?
F	Which is your favorite color, because we see you in so many -- you change so much. Do you have a favorite color, or no?
F	It reflects your personality in some way?
F	With Justine's retirement, how wide open is the field for Roland Garros this year? How many players have a legitimate shot at winning the title?
M	What's the problem, Novak?
M	Can you just talk about your symptoms. Do you feel sick? Is it just a sore throat?
M	Considering that, did you do well to actually get to the semifinal itself then? Did you do above what you could have possibly done to get to today?
M	Any fever at all?
M	You were already sick in the first set of the previous match.
M	And you have to look at the season, as well, because the clay court season is a very tough season, very demanding. If you're going to be in peak condition for Paris, you have to take care of yourself.
M	How did Roger look to you, facing him for the first time since Melbourne?
M	So when today did you start to feel it?
M	After three days, nobody knows what it is exactly?
M	You started off well. Was it the lack of preparation? Were you surprised?
M	What about your back?
M	At the end of the second set, what did you do wrong?
M	There were positive parts of the game. Is there something positive to take out of it?
M	He's a complicated player to play against?
M	Are you going to Munich?
M	Are you taking a lot of medication?
M	Those breakpoints affected you?
M	Compared to yesterday, what didn't you do as well?
M	You had eight set points, and he was missing easy shots. Did you believe you would be able to turn the match around then?
M	Were you called for the Davis Cup?
M	Do you believe there's lobbying from the Gasquet family? People say Noah is the indisputable captain. What is your opinion?
M	That is 90% of the truth, at least.
M	But something is wrong.
M	But he said in L'quipe that he thought tennis is a stupid sport, that you have to start all over again all the time, and you are submitted to enormous pressure from the media. So is there a problem with his career?
M	Who puts pressure on him?
M	How?
M	How could we help him?
M	Even if we were there during his practice sessions, how could we see anything positive?
M	But something did happen that weekend, didn't it?
M	How can you help him, since you're a very close friend of his?
M	Do you believe you would have more chances to play in the French team if Forget wasn't the captain?
M	When he doesn't select you, does he call you to give you an explanation?
M	What are your thoughts on your match today?
M	Do you feel like you've played the same way all week, or do you think you're getting better with each match?
M	Have you had a good off-season to prepare you for the Australian Open?
M	Have you done that before, gone to Mexico?
M	Why did you do that this year?  You felt like there was something lacking?
M	So you can really feel the benefits of the altitude in your legs?
M	You're going to play a doubles match soon with your partner, Tomas Berdych.  How much will that take out of you?
M	Your next opponent will be either Guccione or Berdych.  How do you feel like you match up against those two players?
M	Is it more difficult playing an opponent that you know as well as you know Tomas?
M	This is equaling the best performance you've had at this tournament.
M	So you think that would be the best preparation for next week?
M	So you're heel is not bothering you?
M	Is it left or right?
F	Tough match?
F	You called the coach at 5-3.  What did he say to you?  What did you talk about?
F	Do you find that much of an advantage?  To call the coach obviously hasn't been around for a long time.  Do the players sort of appreciate that?
F	I don't want to read too much into the way you grew up practicing tennis in Serbia, but do you feel that maybe you have element of toughness that some players just can't match just knowing where you come out of?
F	Bu specifically like, I guess, playing tennis in a swimming pool.  It wasn't exactly like doing it out of glitz and glamour.
F	Would you like to think now that you have the game -- obviously you've got to a Grand Slam final -- but you have the game and the challenge to win down in Melbourne?
F	There were some groundstrokes that went long.  Did you find the court slow at all, or did it make any difference to you at all?
F	Had you been in Australia some time in December?
F	Doing what, practicing?
F	Any particular things that you enjoyed that it nothing to do with tennis?
F	Does hearing the fans add to your confidence?
M	Congratulations, Mardy.
M	You have restored yourself.  Have you been planning or thinking about this and wondering what has happened to your game and how you could restore yourself?
M	How much of what you accomplished here do you put into the technical and strategic excellence of the game this week and how much do you put in the emotional bin?
M	Does Djokovic have the tools to be No.1 at some place soon?
M	Who do you think the best tennis player in the world is now?
M	When you came in here yesterday, you said you hadn't realized what had happened yet.  When did you, and what was that like?
M	What were your thoughts when you were trailing 2-4 in the second set, and what do you think is the key to you turning it around?
M	Have you ever felt crowd support quite like you did today?
M	Did it affect the way you played at all?
M	A lot of guys have good games for the surface, given the way people are playing today and stuff, but are there special things about his game that stand out and strike you as being particularly difficult to play?
M	So many people feel technology is flawless.  My question is two parts:  Do you think Hawk-Eye is accurate, and do you think it puts, the system puts too much pressure on the players to make instant calls on?
M	Third set, at what point did you feel like the momentum started switching?  At what point did it feel like he regained the momentum?
M	What was the struggle with the serve today?  Anything you can pinpoint to?
M	What did you do at 4:00 in the morning?  You couldn't fall back asleep.  Did you start replaying yesterday's match?  Answer e-mail?
M	Join the club.
M	There were some sporadic calls from the crowd all the way through between the first and second serves.  Did that bother you at all?
M	Do you feel that you found yourself this week?
M	What was your thought process after you failed to serve it out at 5-3?  How did you get your head around it?
M	The other day Rafa said that the first time you beat him, it wasn't so much about your game but he didn't play good that day.  What do you think about that?
M	You had a very good chance to serve the match out at 5-3 and maybe didn't play your best game.  Can you talk about that?
M	You were ahead 5-2 in the set.  Talk about how the last 5 games, how it got away from you.
M	How important was this match in your own mind in terms of what you've done this year and a chance to play again now and show you could do it again?  Was it a very important match for you?
M	How hard is it to -- he takes so much time between points.  How hard is it for you to wait and wait and wait for him to play?
M	But does it bother you?
M	Yeah.
M	You haven't played many matches since Australia, so was that a factor at all today?
M	Did you feel in the pressure moments that you were there or were you a little bit lost?
M	Did you think that he played more aggressive against you today than he did in Australia?
M	Was the court slower here?
M	Australia didn't give you chances to come in.
M	When you were speaking to the umpire in the third set, was that about Rafa's taking too much time or was it a line call?
M	And then you think maybe -- you went up to him two times.  Did you lose your concentration a little bit then?
M	Can you just talk a little bit about the Davis Cup tie coming up against the United States and how you feel France's chances are?
M	Did you think the United States is the favorite or you think it's even?
M	Did you hear what Andy said about the Davis Cup earlier this week?
M	He said that he heard that you said that the United States had to fear them, and Andy basically said that they're not going to be afraid of you and you still have to work to get on the team.
M	The Frenchman had a good win in Las Vegas last week.  Do you think that will help your confidence and be a factor?
M	Have you ever been to North Carolina in the United States?
M	Coming into this tournament you spoke about the need to get matches under your belt.  In some ways, would you have preferred a tougher workout today?
M	In these baseline days, is it nice to play against a player who plays the way he does?
M	You mentioned after the match the other day that you just wanted to play conservatively.  Were you trying to make a point to push yourself and be more aggressive?
M	What do you feel like you've accomplished in these first couple matches going forward?
M	Computer shows you and Rafa to be pretty close in points, but do you feel he's close to you these days?
M	Do you think his hardcourt game has improved?
M	You come to the net quite a lot, but I doubt you'd describe yourself in terms of a serve and volleyer in terms of a Stefan Edberg or Pat Rafter of the past.  Do you think in this day and age it's possible to be out and out serve and volleyer and compete at the very top of the game?
M	Any plans to do that?
M	You've done a great job over the years neutralizing the strong shots, strokes of the opponents like Andy's serve or Agassi's groundies.  But is Rafa's forehand, particularly on clay, the toughest stroke you've had to deal with?
M	Roger, how much better do you think you can get?
M	How do you feel about Alinghi having to sail against the catamaran now?  Looks like there's a judgment now.
M	They are going to have to sail against Oracle next year.
M	You've had some amazing streaks in tennis.  Have you been in contact with Tiger about his own winning streak?
M	Congratulations.  Can you talk about that second set?  You had a chance to serve it out.
M	What did you do to kind of keep your mindset straight for that third set?
M	Could you talk about dealing with the conditions?  You could really hear the flags flapping and people were hitting unusual shots, to say the least.
M	Was that anything like when you played on the Easter Bowl, because in the Easter Bowl it's really windy and there's nothing really to shield the wind?
M	You've really paid your dues in the pro tour.  When did things start turning around for you?  What happened that started turning things around?
M	You feel you had to sacrifice your social life perhaps to do this?
M	What's the most fun part of the social scene in Atlanta?
M	Your friends understand sort of the decision you had to make to go forward?
M	Did you call anyone home in Atlanta to see if anyone was affected by the tornado yesterday?
M	Everybody's okay?  Nobody was injured or anything?
M	What's the club?
M	Is it much more fun now because you figure you can play with these guys, you really believe you can?
M	Looking back, what was it like when you were, what was it, 10 or how many rounds in a row you lost?
M	What were you thinking in those days?
M	Was the lowest point Miami?  I remember we talked to you, and it was kind of heart wrenching there.
M	How did you put that in the rear view mirror?  You mentioned your parents obviously having a big effect.
M	You go up against a pretty good player next.  You've never played Rafa.  What are your thoughts?  Pretty imposing?
M	What's it like playing another lefty?
M	If you were playing yourself, what would be your first tactic?
M	You happy to play Lopez today, because he's a left-hander?
M	What kind of things did you learn when you played him at the US Open that you applied today?
M	But did you make any big adjustments from the US Open to today?
M	Querrey just won the tournament in Vegas.  Does that say anything to you?  Does that give you any thoughts of confidence?  He's an American.
M	What do you think you have to do against Nadal?  What will be the fun part, or what will be the tactical part to have a shot?
M	Did you see Tsonga play him at the Australian?
M	Do you think in a way all those losses somehow were good for you?
M	What's the two biggest things you're going to have do to take another big leap?  You've taken a nice leap now.  What do you have to do?
M	The ATP Tour is kind of a tough club to get into.  It's sort of hard to feel that you belong.  You got a lot of wildcards and people were talking.  Do you feel now that you belong?  Do you feel part of the tour?
M	You weren't on the Davis Cup team, but you were on the squad working with them.  How important was that to your advantage?
M	Do you wish you could have played the dead rubber up in Portland?
M	Hazing, did they make you sing or anything?  What did you have to do?
M	What did you --
F	You're up a set and then a break in the second, what happened from there?
F	First game of the third set you missed a few kind of easy forehands.
F	Can you talk about moving back into the top 10, what this tournament has done for your confidence going into the US Open.
F	What was the reason that you failed to recover quickly enough? Is it because you haven't played enough matches in the past few weeks?
F	You've never beaten her. What do you think makes her so difficult for you?
F	Anything in particular happen in the second set?
F	How do you feel heading down to New York now? Are you feeling confident going into the Open?
F	Does she remind you of anybody, her style of play?
M	Did a lack of the match experience in the last few months catch up to you today?
M	Is there any one area where you feel like it's not working, or is it kind of across the board?
M	In the I guess the seventh game of the third set, 4-3. You accepted the reserve there. Can you just go over, clarify what happened with you and the chair umpire?
M	Did you feel any added pressure knowing that the draw was relatively open after Roger lost last night?
M	In the second set when he was up a break, had a chance to kind of close out the match in the next couple games. He gave you a bit of an opening. Were you expecting something like that again in the third, and were you surprised that he was able to serve it out so easily?
M	What can you say about your opponent's play today, and how does he compare to some of the younger up and coming guys on the tour right now?
M	What's the road map for you now in terms of fixing whatever it is that's wrong? You don't seem to have an idea of what's missing right now.
M	Sorry.
M	You came here, took part in the doubles, too. That didn't work out for you. Do you continue doing that now, stay with the doubles, or concentrate on the singles?
M	Can you just talk about how important returning serve is against Llodra. Seems like if you take that away you chop out a big weapon of his game.
M	This is such a punishing tournament. Is it a little bit of a disadvantage to have to go to three sets in your first match? You've been to the finals of this tournament. It's a very hard week from beginning to end.
M	What's your feeling on the state of the tour right now in terms of everybody is talking about Rafa and Roger and about how difficult it is to crack the top two. Now that Rafa has moved up, it seems like it's even more difficult at the high end of sport right now.
M	Boris Becker was just in here and he said that he thinks that Rafs has passed Roger. That he is a little bit better right now, there's no debate. Do you feel the same way?
M	You've beaten Roger, and not many people can say that. Do you think he can still improve, or do you think he's kind of reached that ceiling?
M	Do you know Michael very well? Are you good friends off the court?
M	Especially so early on in a tournament, get him right off the bat.
F	What would be your biggest regret about the match? If you could change something, what would you do different?
F	It seems like overall you're a better player than her, better strokes, but she's very strong mentally. Did you feel that?
F	Did you feel they were unfair?
F	Have you played in those conditions before, with a crowd that much for your opponent?
F	Did you know much about her before the match?
F	What did your coach tell you to look for from her?
F	The overhead you missed in the tiebreak, was that a good lob or you just missed it?
F	Collapse?
F	Are you very disappointed?
F	Are you still wearing the Stella McCartney clothes?
F	Can you explain to us what happened in the first set, it was so up-and-down, up-and-down?
F	Overall, what do you take away from the week?
F	You said yesterday that you were going to try to not only win the final, but enjoy the day and enjoy the final. What went wrong do you think?
F	As you saw the game slowly slipping away, do you think with hindsight you might have sort of given up too easily?
F	Finally, you had quite a lot of support out there. Any message for your fans?
F	After this hectic week, what are you planning to do?
F	Do you think in your mind what this tournament change a little bit the Russians? You come here as one of the last Russians and now you go for the final, you play very well this week. I already asked you, but maybe you can say something more about what will change after this for you?
F	Congratulations, it must be nice to qualify. But is it tennis with sympathy for your sister?
F	Is this the best you've played in this competition? You've been to the semis twice before, I think, but not made the final.
F	This is the third time?
F	Is this the best you've played in this competition?
F	You're about as close as competitive sisters can be. So what goes through your mind when you see that she was very upset out there on court? What goes through your mind and what can you do as a big sister afterwards?
F	Obviously, you'd be surprised at how easy the last two sets were. You got any understanding why that would be?
F	Were you surprised she didn't fight more than she used to do as usual, for instance at the US Open she was down in both sets and then she came back fighting very well. This time it was not the case?
F	Did you have a problem with the left knee? Because at the second set at 4-1, it seemed that you were touching your knee and that you couldn't push that much on the left knee afterwards on your serve?
F	Compared to all your other competitors, because you know your sister really well, you know her personality, what makes her tick, do you find it's possibly marginally easier to play against her?
F	And how do you reconcile the fact that -- I mean, it's the first time I actually met you and I find you extremely composed, extremely relaxed. You're in control of yourself with the powerful aggression that's needed in the game, how do you marry the two together?
F	How much of your victory today do you think was down to effective opposition with your sister having a bit of turmoil, especially in the last set, rather than you actually excelling yourself? Or was it a bit of both?
F	And confident enough to win?
F	Yeah.
F	You must be disappointed to lose when you've played so well?
F	What happened at 5-3?
F	You have defeated Jelena a lot of times before. You think since Roland Garros she's improved her game?
F	Just back on the trainer, was it breathing problems? Was it related to dust in the air?
F	Secondly, are conditions like this easier for a player that tends to keep the ball in play and away from mistakes, rather than someone who is going to be attacking and trying to hit winners?
F	Will you take any precautions to prevent a repeat of what happened, not feeling well? Is there anything you can do?
F	Was the wind difficult?
F	But you still feel that you can qualify, do you?
F	Tennis is supposed to be a sport that's played outdoors, but you've all been indoors since the US Open, really. So is it kind of strange to have this tournament, which is the biggest tournament of the tour suddenly going outdoors again after you've been indoors for a couple of months?
F	Where would you rather play tennis, indoors or outdoors?
F	You were very unlucky in that you got to world No.1 and then you got the injury, but you fought your way back. Do you feel your level is basically back to where it was before you became No.1?
F	Have you been watching a little bit of Vera playing today and how do you see tomorrow's match?
F	You said that you feel that Jelena is more confident on the court. How do you feel that on the court that she's more confident?
M	A few weeks ago before Indian Wells, people were saying, and looking at his record, thinking he's maybe a little bit in your head. What turned around? And are you in his head a little bit now maybe?
M	You've found a way to get on James' backhand side and make that work for you. How have you done that?
M	Does it help to hit the service returns high to James on the backhand side?
M	Has Djokovic's early loss here taken a bit of pressure off you in terms of ranking? Obviously after this tournament you've got a lot of points to defend. Do you feel a little less pressure now?
M	Do you feel as though you're game is coming together now? I know it's the end of hard court season, but do you get the sense that things are beginning to come into place for you at an important time?
M	In both these matches the past few weeks, at the end James' level seemed to go down. He looked like he wasn't feeling so confident anymore. Is that something that you notice on your side of net? When was the last time you felt so discouraged against a player at that stage of the match?
M	Maybe the most important point of the match: Breakpoint, fourth game, third set. He hits an overhead right at you. Did you feint one way first to try to get behind you? Is that how you were able to retrieve the over head?
M	Can you talk a little bit about the fact that you missed so many breakpoints today?
M	But were you getting a bit crazy about it?
M	Will you watch Berdych tonight?
M	Should you reach the final, would you prefer to play Roger Federer and maybe get the chance to reverse the result of 2005 when you had a lead of two sets to Love and 4-1 and you lost the match? Would you prefer to play Federer because of that?
M	Yeah. But would you prefer Federer in the final if you get there?
M	Last week Tommy Haas, you had a walkover against Haas, and now he suddenly retires against you. How do you feel about that?
M	Was there a point you could tell? Was it early on that you realized something was wrong with him?
M	Before the match, how did you see Soderling? What you are your thoughts?
M	How does it affect you as the opponent when the match ends early? You're obviously mentally and physically prepared for a longer match.
M	Your friend Tiger Woods was here in Doral last weekend. Did you get a chance to cross paths with him or talk to him prior to this tournament?
M	What have you been able to get out of your first two matches here?
M	You don't seem like you've really been challenged much. Is there a difference between this and just practice?
M	How do you feel about the chances maybe going all the way again now? Obviously Novak lost early. You mentioned Hewitt, and the draw is opening up for you. How do you feel about your chances?
M	We're all looking forward to you playing Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, but that's not going to happen now. How do you feel about playing Julien Benneteau?
M	So switch the question. Acasuso, talk about him.
M	An Olympic question, if you would: Does tennis belong in the Olympics?
M	Because of you all being professionals, and it's always been thought of as an event for amateurs, what would you say in defense of the idea of tennis being part of the Games?
M	Do you think most tennis players are excited about the opportunity, or is it all over the map? I'm thinking of Andy deciding not to play.
M	Earlier this year, Justine Henin won a tournament in Antwerp and played players that were lower ranked.
M	No, but she said she preferred to play top players she faces normally in finals and everything. She would have preferred to play higher end players she knows. What's it like for you?
M	Looking at the slow-mo replay of the point, you know which one?
M	Just watching, you hit that ball on the run. It's hard to tell whether you had a full five fingers on the racquet or not. Did you?
M	On your personal list of great shots that you've hit, where does that one lineup?
M	Does that shot have a name, Andy?
M	First set, you were kind of your own worst enemy there with your serves.
M	Was it also a function of no matches in the last week?
M	Did you feel at all that it was tough to find a rhythm at times? You would get going and there would be an interruption either by Viktor or by the flow of the game with there being a break?
M	Are you better at dealing with those kind of little things than you were maybe a few years ago?
M	How about the third game of the third set. Can you talk about escaping that game?
M	When you broke in the second set, you followed up with five first serves, including an ace to close out the next game. Was that an emotional turning point in the match?
M	He's played several Top 10 players really tough. Did he sort of come out of nowhere in your eyes, or did you know anything about him?
M	The Hawk-Eye people have a standing invitation to all players to come on up and look at their technology. Have you ever thought about taking advantage of that opportunity just to see what it's like?
M	So you're no longer a believer in Hawk-Eye?
M	What did happen on that one call? We were all confused. It just said, "call stands."
M	What's the sense in the locker room about the time that Djokovic and Nadal are taking these days over their serves? Is there any kind of debate about it or conversation about it?
M	Where do you feel your game is at right now having come through such a tough scream like you did today? Do you feel like you're coming toward the top of your game again?
M	Minar, off the clay on hard court. Can you give us a few words on him?
M	Where does that rank on your career victory scale?
M	What did you do well today?
M	You had three matchpoints.  Have you ever had that against someone, you know, so good, and how does that help in a way?
M	You haven't had a chance to play on Stadium Court with Hawk-Eye probably before, have you?
M	So did you sweat out that challenge in the tie break?  It is a pretty big moment?
M	What did you say to yourself mentally going into this match?  Because he can hit some huge shots, aces, big forehands.  But he'll also get frustrated and maybe help you a little bit, give away a couple points.  What did you tell yourself going into this match against him?
M	When he double faulted there in the tie breaker, it looked like you came up a little more than usual.  Is that part of your strategy, make him think about what you're doing on the return?
M	A lot of perhaps casual tennis fans in the United States might not know much about you.  And I'm sure they'd love to follow an American here.  Can you talk a little about yourself outside tennis?  You know, some things that you love to do, some hobbies people might not know about.
M	You're getting married soon?
M	Now your brother goes to Charleston?
M	Oh, that's interesting.
M	What's she doing now?
M	Marat just told us he's still playing for the love of things and he has enough cash in his bank account that he can quit any time.  I'm assuming that might not be your situation?
M	What is on your horizon?  What is your expectation and your goal at this point in your career?  You've been at it for a while, fighting the good fight for a while.
M	Was going to college a good way to go?  Did you get your degree ever?
M	What made you decide to leave early?  And are you glad you went?
M	And your fiancee, what is her name and what does she do?
M	Marat also compared your style to Andy Roddick's.  Do you think that's a fair comparison?
M	I think stylistically is what he meant.  Is Andy's game a game that you have sort of looked at over the years and thought, this is something I can - a style I can fit into?
M	Your dad's a pilot, a commercial pilot?
M	With Delta.  The other thing is Josie, right?  What did she do in track and field?
M	What did you study at Vandy?
M	What is the condition of your injury? You looked extremely excited after you win it. What did you think of your game?
M	You seemed a little tense when the match started in the first set. Were you so? If so, do you know why?
M	I know you don't know who you're playing, so could you make a comment on either of the two opponents.
M	Could you talk about Roger a little bit. Every great player before him, like Pete Sampras, whoever, reached a point where they're still great players, but not considered up beatable, have that aura that players just don't feel there's a way to beat them. Do you think Roger has hit that point in his career where the other players feel he's more beatable than he had been in the past?
M	You've said you're much more mature and have more confidence than last year's Masters Cup. Given the fact you didn't do well in Madrid and Paris, how did you turn things around to play so well in Shanghai?
M	Last year you came for the first time in the Masters Cup pretty exhausted and you lost your three matches. This year did you prepare especially to do better at this competition?
M	Could you tell us what happened in the 10th game of the third set. You served for the match but got broken. And if you can choose, who are you going to choose to play in the final?
M	Mathematically there was a scenario if you try to fight harder in the match against Tsonga, you may have a chance to overtake Roger in the world ranking No.2 if you win here in Shanghai. Now Roger is No.2 and you will finish as No.3. How do you take on this?
M	You mentioned the other day Miss Universe was in your box. You had Robert De Niro at one US Open. Does a tournament take a different reflection when the celebrities come, like the US Open and Miami? Is that fun for the players, or you don't care?
M	Suppose you win tomorrow. What will the victory mean to you?
M	I want to ask you about the Davis Cup final in Mar del Plata next week. Who do you think is going to win and why?
M	Although that finished quickly, it was obviously an extremely tough first set which could have gone either way at one point. How did you see it?
M	Was his comeback in the first set more your level dropping or his going up?
M	How do you feel after two matches now? What's the body feeling?
M	Unless our maths are incorrect, you're through to the semifinals. How does that feel to be in the last four in your first Masters Cup?
M	We don't know what the outcome of this match is going to be, but how do you approach a match against Federer, knowing that you're already there whatever the outcome?
M	You have received your second victory at the tennis Masters Cup. At 21 years old, you reached the final of the US Open and have two titles in the ATP Masters Series so far. Tim Henman only won one tennis Masters Cup. Do you think you have excelled Tim in your career?
M	I know you want to beat Federer, but how do you lift yourself, though, when you know you've got Saturday coming, if not Sunday? You've got to keep something in the tanks. How do you find a balance there?
M	You've been here in Shanghai for the first time. What do you think about the atmosphere here in the stadium and maybe on the streets? Maybe you've met some Chinese people now. What do you think?
M	What was your state of mind starting the last tiebreak? Did you feel nervous or very confident at that time?
M	After winning this match, what do you expect for the next one from Del Potro?
M	What do you think about your next match?
M	When the crowd is favoring your opponent so much, does that make it difficult for you, or do you find that it motivates you to prove them wrong?
M	What do you think the key factor of changing the whole game was in this comeback victory?
M	You are more of a defensive player than Tsonga, but in today's match you made more winners than him. This is your strategy for this match, to play more aggressively than your opponent on the baseline? What did you do in this match to win?
M	Several months ago I remember you said you lost a little bit of motivation. Have you got your motivation back? Also you played four Masters Cups in Shanghai. How confident are you this is not your last Masters Cup?
M	In Paris in the final, Jo had 25 aces against Nalbandian. Today he had just a few aces. What was your secret on the return? Could you read his serve very easily? What was the key for you in the return?
M	I'd like to know your feeling about the Davis Cup final.
M	You have played in front of the Argentinian fans. Do you think it will be a key factor?
M	You served for the match at 5-3. You watched Tsonga come back with some pretty amazing shots. How do you put that game behind you and pull yourself back together to pull off the victory?
M	You're superstitious. I heard you don't call your parents when you are winning.
M	You still don't call them?
M	Do you have other superstitions?
M	A question about Japan and the culture. What is your favorite part of Japan's culture, manga, sushi, sake?
M	Do you take pictures?
M	Your jumping forehand is fun. Did you invent it yourself?
M	Which shots are your favorite?
M	Your transfer from junior to senior tennis was smooth. What was the recipe, because many young people are not as successful as you are?
M	Who did you practice with?
M	Was the match as much fun as you hoped?
M	Because you closed out the second set with an ace. You looked very confident.
M	A lot of players have said that the courts are very slippery. Did you find that?
M	What do you find is the most tricky element between moving from clay to grass?
M	Five or six times?
M	Does the fact that Rafa has done so well on grass, does that make it easier to say, If you like clay, you can play on grass, it's not such a problem any more?
M	Clearly off the back of Paris, your confidence levels must be pretty high. You had a fantastic tournament there. Would you say you are at the moment probably as confident a player as you've been in your career?
M	We first saw you in the first round of the French Open last year. You treated our No.1 badly. You're playing our No.1 tomorrow. What do you think of him? How do you see that particular matchup?
M	I take it there are not many grass courts back at home?
M	What was your first experience playing a grass court match?
M	What did your experience at Wimbledon last year tell you about yourself, how you dealt with the tournament?
M	Which court was that on?
M	Because of what you did in Paris and the higher-ranked players you played against, does it mean you are not bothered that Andy is world No.11 and expected to win?
M	One guy who knows Andy really well is Novak. Will you maybe ask him for a few tips about playing Andy?
M	You had a tough match today. Important to come through a match like that, having lost that tiebreaker, in terms of approaching tomorrow?
M	I take it getting pumped to play Andy Murray at Queen's on grass is not going to be a problem?
M	When you came in to this tournament, for whatever reason you were brimming with confidence. Is that really true?
M	If you compare when you won in 2007, what things have changed in your confidence and your tennis and the way you feel now?
M	I know your priority is Wimbledon, but how sweet is winning the US Open? This is No.5. Could you compare both?
M	You were showing more emotion in this tournament than I personally have ever seen, even in the earlier rounds - fist pumps throughout the whole tournament, almost like Jimmy Connors right there. What was it about this tournament that you really had an asterisk next to it? You wanted to win it almost more than I've ever seen.
M	Now that you have your first major win and your third major final of the year, how would you describe your year?
M	How do you expect it to carry over for next year? What do you expect of yourself next year?
M	You had that huge reception on opening night, and throughout the fans have been by your side. Today was incredible. Even afterwards, the throngs didn't want to let you go. Talk about the connection between this town, odd, brash New Yorkers, and a pretty sophisticated European Swiss guy. How is that chemistry working and what's happening that's so wonderful?
M	So you feel like a little bit like a New Yorker now?
M	Can you sort of tell us what you've been doing the last couple of hours to celebrate?
M	An argument could be made that you had the mono early on and it's taken you all this time really to fully recover. Do you think that's possible?
M	You mentioned you lost a few tournaments. Did that bother you that there seemed to be this growing conventional wisdom that Roger Federer has had a great career but he may have peaked at this point and he's on the downside. Did that ever get to you?
M	The tactics that you used against Murray, could you describe that a little more, the second serve attacking, attacking the net?
M	How much of a factor do you think experience was today? You have all the Grand Slam finals and he had none.
M	Experience.
M	Can you say specifically what Andy has to do to take that extra step actually to win a Slam?
M	On that note, you always seem to speak with tremendous sportsmanship, especially about some of the younger players coming up through the ranking. Is that something maybe as a statesman now you feel a responsibility to do?
M	When you started knocking down the Slams very quickly, Sampras with 14 was out there. Now you're right there at 13. Does that do anything to your head now, and will it do anything to your head in the next year?
M	How much of a priority is now regaining No.1? And how easy or difficult do you think you've got it?
M	Two questions: Are you still playing Stockholm first? And second, can you talk a little bit more about your parents and Mirka helping this year, especially with all these doomsday scenarios sort of came out, what impact they've been on you?
M	I'm not sure if you heard this, you finished the match, and the group started playing You're Still the One.
M	Sorry?
M	I know, but this time it meant something to you. What did it mean to you?
M	On a similar theme, Roger, you have this crazy situation where you only got two finals and the semi and a gold. And you set a standard that was so incredibly high, so all the questions were there, hey, what's up. If you had to boil down the two weeks you had here at the US Open and your experience, do you think the best word is "redemption" or is there a better phrase or word that comes to you?
M	How much of a relief was it to get through this in straight sets knowing you have two days, maybe three if it rains, Saturday to prepare for the semis?
M	Set points in the first set and break points throughout the match. Created a lot of those opportunities, but you weren't able to take advantage. As those are accumulating, are you frustrated, annoyed, angry?
M	Do you feel you're moving as well as you have in the past?
M	For your great winning streaks at the majors, this is the one that's still intact. As you move closer to the final do you feel more pressure because of that to keep it going?
M	You've been showing more emotion in this tournament than in years past here in New York. Can you kind of describe some of those cries you had out on court, what language they were in, and what you were feeling at that time?
M	I know it's always satisfying to win a major, but if you're able to defend here, given the circumstances of this season, would you consider it one of your most satisfying wins?
M	Andy Roddick was saying it actually helped him when he saw people picking Gulbis before he played him. Do you ever derive any motivation from people picking against you, or is your personality just different?
M	How much of your success in the next round is going to be based on form, and how much of it is going to be based on fight and experience?
M	When you speak of your change and emotional outlook, you sound more and more like Pete Sampras. Are you starting to identify with Pete, who in the beginning of his career did keep his head down and then began to show emotions in the latter stages?
M	How would you compare the way you feel now in terms of the tennis as you did last year and the year before, say?
M	Last year in the finals you met with Djokovic. There's a chance you might see him again soon. He's changed over the year, not imitating so much on the court. How is it different now if you were to play him compared to playing him year ago in the finals?
M	You said in the on-court interview that you were actually trying to relax yourself by saying, Well, if we go to a fourth set, that's okay. Would you be conceding that maybe even mentally perhaps last year or a couple of years before, have you come to terms with perhaps the idea of not being invincible anymore?
M	What an incredible match. Did you expect that kind of effort from him?
M	Did the heat bother you at all?
M	The tiebreak was some sensational shots by both of you. It's too bad it had to end with a match point with two net cords.
M	When you say you don't have enough power, in this tournament is this a cumulative fatigue or...
M	No racquets?
M	How many racquets did you break today?
M	You broke four racquets today?
M	Well, that's quite a contrast from Miami where you played the whole tournament with one racquet?
M	With the past regarding gambling allegations, and it's a big thing that we're not supposed to talk about here at the US Open, but a match when you go and lose as the fifth seed to the player ranked 130th in the world, do you feel you have to start explaining to people, hey, this is real, there's nothing funny here?
M	There has been a report that you're about to be cleared. How big a relief will that be if that happens?
M	There's been a report in the British press.
M	That your name is about to be cleared.
M	Exonerated. If that happens soon, I assume that would be a huge relief to you?
M	Will it make a big difference in how you're able to approach your job?
M	More?
M	More tournaments?
M	Have you heard anything to that effect, that you might be exonerated soon?
M	How have these allegations affected your attitude towards playing professional tennis?
M	The allegations and all that you've been through with these allegations, how have they affected your attitude about playing professional tennis? I mean, you're talking about the fact that it affected you this year. You're not playing very well. Has it taken the joy out of playing? Just, if you can comment on that.
M	Couldn't that also be simply because you've played so much in the last few years? You're known as the iron man maybe prior to this season, you played every week. Doesn't that start to add up in terms of being tired?
F	As in Wimbledon, she was able to take a first set from you, but you came back strong. What was the difference? What changed out there?
F	Today was the first time it looked like you could really win this tournament.
F	How much of a goal is it of yours to regain the No.1 position? You had it just a few weeks ago.
F	You talked over the course of the last week on how special that was.
F	You're the 10th player that Nick Bollettieri has helped to the No.1 ranking. What has he meant to your career?
F	What's the key to how he succeeds?
F	Next opponent could be Sybille Bammer. Could you tell us a little bit about that.
F	Bartoli.
F	Caroline has been moving forward very fast, and she's top 20 now, 18. What is it she's doing so well, and how is she as a player?
F	When you were with Bollettieri, how much time did you spend in schoolwork during the week and how much of that was language, English language?
F	With your coach and your mom this week, have they been saying anything to the effect that you can win a Grand Slam, your game is there, put the injuries aside?
F	At the French and at Wimbledon when you had tough losses, you came in afterward and told us pretty good jokes, including the helicopter jokes. I wonder, do you actually consider humor to be an important tool for playing this tough tour? Because not a lot of players have it.
F	Seems like New York maybe more than any other Grand Slam city might fit your personality the best.
F	Can you talk about that last game, 11 deuces.
F	Is it hard to play her sometimes because she gets everything back?
F	Do you feel you're playing better, the same, not so good as at Wimbledon?
F	Did you know she's been talking about how tired she is? Were you trying to keep the match going as long as possible to see if she was maybe...
F	At Wimbledon, you said you were going to give money to the victims at Sichuan. Have you been able to do that?
F	Have you done it?
F	And you have given the money?
F	You were going to give money.
F	No, no. Sichuan.
F	You hit a flat ball. On grass it stays low. Is that one reason that you prefer grass?
F	Once again now you've lost to Jelena in straight sets. Do you feel that your game is improving?
F	People say the singles draw is very open and a lot of people could win it. Is it the same with the doubles?
F	Do you show your emotions more now, your feelings, than when you started when you were younger? Today you showed your emotions. You were happy. You were sad. Maybe when you were younger you were more shy.
F	But sometimes today you smiled.
F	And sometimes you get angry, you get mad, too?
M	You were cramping?
M	Bet you were glad you didn't have to go five.
M	Reason for the cramping just doing a lot of work out there, lots of running?
M	Speaking of body types you have Ivo next.
M	You played three times and won twice?
M	Guys talk about his serve as a weapon that's almost impossible to deal with. I would think that of all people you feel like you're on kind of even ground.
M	Do you feel like why not let's just go to tiebreaker?
M	So this kind of match today, long, lots of points, you had to do the work, second round the US Open. You got through, and mentally it's got to be a good win.
M	What do you think; do you think your body can hold out through another few match?
M	So coming into the tournament, did you have a positive feeling where you thought, okay, if I play to my level maybe I can really do some damage?
M	What's your pick on James versus Mardy? Tough one, huh?
M	Oh, that's right. So that was what, the second to last point of the match, right?
M	Is that one of your best scramble points ever?
M	Did you think he was going to make the pass?
M	So a little bit of luck there?
M	Amer kind of made a match out of it at the end, but what were your sensations first couple sets?
M	I was wondering about your Beijing experience. You looked forward to it, got a tough draw, went all that way to play one match. Was that tiring? Do you regret at all going? And how long did you stay? Did you stick around after your match and kind of see other events?
M	Is this still a special place for you?
M	How was your summer?
M	Long.
M	So coming in here, you wanted to get some matches in the summer and didn't go to Beijing. Feel like you accomplished what you wanted?
M	Are you flying coachless right now?
M	What are your expectations coming in here?
M	You have Mathieu?
M	You're consistent.
M	Is it just it's just the home slam and you've come in here really riding high?
M	September 25th?
M	Let me ask you a question, do you think that some players are early-season players and other players are late-season players? Like some come out of the gate strong and...
M	Early?
M	Is it because your fresh?
M	Are guys known for being, This is a guy you can knock off earlier in the year or this is a guy that comes out at the end of the year and he's fried?
M	Right. Guys like Nadal, obviously clay has something to do with it, but I think only six or seven of his 31 titles are after July.
M	Looks like Novak doesn't like you to stay too long in the No.1 position.
M	Was the first set more because of fatigue? You've been playing well. Looked like the first set was very different than what you had been playing before. Was it just him playing better, or...
M	When you know that you will become world No.1 quite soon, is it more difficult to focus than just on the next match?
M	But now that it's happened, do you not feel excited?
M	With all the matches that you've played, is this going to be difficult on you physically to play the Olympics and then the US Open?
M	When do you leave for the Olympics?
M	Are you excited?
M	As you look back on this tournament, what are some of the positives that you take out of it? I mean, the fact that you became No.1, or at least you will be in a couple of weeks partially because of this tournament, what are some of positive that you take from this match?
M	So much of the attention this week has been about you and Roger and the No.1 spot. Is Djokovic almost like the forgotten man?
M	You came to this tournament with a lot of confidence because you won the French Open and Wimbledon. But he beat you also in Indian Wells. How can you compare those two matches?
M	In Beijing you'll stay in a hotel or in the Village?
M	Will Cincinnati always be special to you because you earned the No.1 ranking here?
M	How does the Olympics compare to other tournaments like a Grand Slam or something? How is it different and how do you appreciate it?
M	In terms of playing Gulbis next, he certainly seems to be playing well right now. How would you assess that match?
M	And with an easy game like this, I think we can say it was easy because of the scores, and it gives you a lot of confidence now?
M	We talked your serve yesterday. Today it was around 56%. How did you feel you served today?
M	He had a pretty good clay court season and he's known as a pretty good baseliner. Did you feel he was off today?
M	Yesterday you mentioned that when you're not serving well it comes from your mind. I'd like to know if you have any special technique to work on mind? How do you work on mind?
M	But what kind of extra subjects really affect you?
M	Like maybe politics in your country or...
M	Good way to start the week. Everything working pretty well?
M	How have you felt this season on hard courts? Seems like there's been quite a bit of difference in your results based on the surface.
M	Are you starting to feel that way yet, or do you need a couple more wins?
M	What do you think are the most important issues for the players going forward with the ATP Tour as far as players being involved with figuring out the schedule and the calendar?
M	With uncertainty about the future of the tour, certainly with the lawsuit going on right now, how much representation should players have?
M	I had a question about the match today. I mean, you played well, but Fish had like 25 unforced errors and you only had like 4. Do you think that he was playing more erratic than he normally does? Coming in, I think Fish was 3-2 in head-to-heads with you. Can you comment on that?
M	Seemed like after you broke him in the first set the second time that he really got more frustrated. He's made it to the final in 2003 and played a great match against Andy Roddick. He's played well here before. I just thought that perhaps maybe he played worse than he normally does against you.
M	Sure. You get the winner of Benneteau/Soderling. Soderling is up 5-0 first set. Just thoughts on those two players and how your game matches up.
M	Do you feel really comfortable here on hard courts? I know coming into the year you were 3-7 before this match on hard courts.
M	How do you rank this win in your best of?
M	Your reward is a match against Rafael Nadal. He's had obviously more time to recover than you. I think your match today was longer than his last matches in its entirety. How do you think you'll be physically tomorrow to face him?
M	What time will bedtime be tonight?
M	Have they told you if you're first or second match tomorrow?
M	You said on the TV that you've had to postpone some plans you had for the second week of Wimbledon. May i ask what those plans were?
M	Are you familiar with the famous Pancho Gonzlez, Charlie Pasarell match here.
M	Second longest in Wimbledon history. You tied it with this match.
M	What was on your mind in the tiebreak in the third set when you were leading 6-0?
M	Can you talk about how it was coming back after the final rain break knowing that you maybe only had a few points to play, but a Wimbledon semifinal place at stake.
M	Must have been incredibly tense when you came out for the final few points.
M	In the first point after the break he made a very bad choice. It was the key, I suppose.
M	The first point after the delay. He put the ball on your side.
M	No, you made the point.
M	What do you think you have to do to defeat Nadal tomorrow?
M	British sportsfans have a tradition of favoring the underdog. Do you think that will happen to you tomorrow?
M	You joined Becker and Stich, the only German Wimbledon semifinalists in the Open era. Heck of an achievement whatever happens.
F	What happened with your foot-fault in the first set? It seemed to upset you a little bit.
F	What did you actually get called for, serving in the wrong quadrant?
F	How long would you say that affected you for?
F	Do you think you missed an opportunity when you pulled it back?
F	By the end of the second set the momentum seemed to be very much with you. What happened at the start of the third set to change that?
F	How do you rate the level of Elena's play compared to a few years ago?
F	Did you draw the umpire's attention to the problems you were having with the heat?
F	Even though you're disappointed now, what will you take away from this grass court season?
F	Presumably when you come to Wimbledon you don't expect the heat to be a problem.
M	Do you feel that was one that got away, especially after the first set?
M	Can you talk a little bit about his serving, what he does?
M	Is the daunting thing about playing him that he obviously gets the shots in so well, or is there also a psychological barrier for everyone that he has such a great record? Is that something you have to try to overcome as well?
M	Must get very disspiriting. Seems like every time you get a bit close, he's able to step up another level. Does that get you down when you're playing like that?
M	You did 14 aces against Bolelli. Today I think three or four. What does that mean? Does that mean you served worse or that Federer is much quicker in returning and moving and getting your serves?
M	How far away do you feel you are from the best two or three guys at the moment?
M	Do you feel you can get back into the top four, to get to the point where you're not drawing Roger in the first Monday of the second week?
M	Are you committed to doing that, playing that many matches, if you can?
M	What are your plans now? Are you going to look at Olympics and US Open, or are you going to have to assess the hip injury and possibly consider missing those for surgery?
M	Does it get worse through matches?
M	So losing the first set was even more crucial to you?
M	Do you go back to Sydney straightaway?
M	How does it feel becoming a dad for the second time?
M	Is the baby due in January?
M	Just given the hip and whatever you might do, as long as the body holds out, you'd be trying to come back next year to Wimbledon, that's the plan?
M	Here next year.
F	Can we ask about the knee.
F	Why did you take the tape off?
F	How is it feeling now?
F	At this stage, is there any danger that you might not be able to participate in the fourth round?
F	You aren't going dancing this weekend?
F	Is this match a classic example of a veteran player knowing how to beat --
F	Is it a classic case of a veteran player --
F	An experienced player, how is that?
F	17.
F	She's not a veteran.
F	A lot of the big names have lost in the tournament, a lot of upsets.
F	But you've only gotten to the fourth round here at Wimbledon. Maybe this surface doesn't play into your defensive skills that way. No one really is playing that great. Do you feel like this is a tournament you can win?
F	When you get out on the court, outside of what grass is supposed to be, do you really feel like it's playing radically different than a fast hard court?
F	Does the ball bounce a lot differently than a fast hard court?
F	Consistency is rewarded in the rankings. You have a legitimate shot at No.1 if you do well here. Is that in the back of your mind here?
F	Have you thought about your next-round opponent?
F	Thai girl.
F	Tanasugarn.
F	Do you like grass any more this year than previous years?
F	Are you surprised that Ana Ivanovic and Sharapova have gone out of the competition?
F	What was the last tournament you actually did not call a trainer in one match?
F	Do you remember the last time you didn't call a trainer? You didn't call it against Ana Ivanovic.
M	We were talking about the set points and how you were able to hold those off. He gave you a little help, didn't he?
M	Maybe the key point in the match at 4-4 in the tiebreak.
M	On this particular point at 4-4 where you return short, his second shot left you an opportunity to pass, how difficult was that?
M	Roddick said he was tight. How did you see it?
M	You're having your greatest moments in Grand Slams. Do you just get up higher for the Grand Slam events?
M	What are your thoughts on why there's such a difference that you peak for the big matches?
M	Is this linked to your background, where your family could only get one kilo of carrots...
M	Explain this Safin/Djokovic match yesterday.
M	Something Novak said yesterday was a little disturbing. He said, I'm mentally tired. He's 20 years old coming into Wimbledon, a Grand Slam champion. If you're mentally tired at this stage of your career...
M	When you knew you'd won the match, what was your first reaction?
F	When you finished with the press conference here Tuesday, what did you need to do with your knee? What was the procedure from that point on?
F	How did the 25 to 30 percent manifest itself? What was the level of pain?
F	Disappointing when you were ready to play?
F	How much were you able to do yesterday?
F	You're not concerned about the Olympics then at this point?
F	What's the previous surgery?
F	You're thinking three to four weeks of not doing anything?
F	We've seen you get through 32 draws. Do you come out of this wondering if you really can get through a 128 draw, your body?
F	What are your plans after the Olympics and New York?
F	It seems like just the other day you were a rookie coming onto the tour. You've had this long career. What are your thoughts about the shortness of so many careers these days, particularly Justine?
F	What's changed most in your mind as far as when you were talking about retirement just a couple of years ago, and now it doesn't seem you do talk about retirement at all?
F	So how great is that fire right now?
F	As you leave Wimbledon, do you expect to be back here next year?
F	Is recovery going to be complicated by an active toddler?
F	Why New York? Why is that so important?
F	Single best memory from New York?
F	Can I ask you a general question?
F	Thanks. Are you annoyed or angry that injury and pain seem to be such a prominent part of the job? Is that something you'd like to see addressed, or...
F	What do you recall about your Wimbledon win 1999?
F	You were so close here in 2005. If you don't get that other slam, will you be at peace with that?
F	Your return to the tour was greeted overwhelmingly positively by players, press, public alike. Does it mean a lot to you that so many young players look up to you as a role model?
F	Can you give us an update on the Jagger front.
F	Does he have any awareness that mommy is...
F	You referred to the surreal and luck aspects when you won here in '99. What were your thoughts yesterday when Ivanovic won the net cord that saved her?
F	Do you recall a net cord playing that big a role in any of your matches or any others that you had seen?
M	Entertaining match to watch. Was it a good one to play in?
M	How frustrating was it? You played okay, didn't you?
M	What did Andy say to you afterwards?
M	How far do you think he can go in the tournament?
M	Malisse.
M	How did playing on Centre Court live up to your expectations?
M	If there was one thing that you'll remember about it, what would that one thing be?
M	If there's one thing that you think Andy has to improve on, what do you think that might be?
M	How come you get on with him so well? Where does your friendship date from?
M	Is Andy's game good enough to win Wimbledon this year?
F	Can you give us your thoughts on that match, in particular the first four games when you were leading the defending champion 3-1?
F	What was going through your mind when you're looking at the scoreboard and it shows 3-1 in that set?
F	Venus has just advised you to get Richard Williams as a coach to get you up to her level. What do you think of that?
F	Why were you so relaxed?
F	What do you think you'd have to do if you drew Venus here next year better to beat her?
F	You did produce an amazing level of tennis in that first set. It was really, really good. Why do you think your results on the tour don't reflect that level of tennis?
F	At the last minute you thought you better give a wave to the crowd. They really responded to that.
F	Will you talk to Anne now before she plays Venus in the second round?
F	What was the major difference between the two sets?
F	Venus said she always plays her best tennis as the match progresses. Do you think you play your best tennis at the beginning of a match, or is there not really a rule of thumb?
F	Do you sense there is a bit of a broader revival, albeit a fairly modest one, amongst the British women? How helpful is it a fact there are actually a number of you pushing together as opposed to the isolated person?
F	Twelve months ago you had two match points against Martina Hingis. Are you a better player now than you were then, even if the rankings don't suggest as much?
F	Is the hardest thing now going from in front of 15,000 to playing in front of 5,000 or whatever it is at your next tournament?
F	If you draw the Wimbledon champion in the first round next year, are you going to beat her?
F	Would you have taped the match from the BBC today? Did you have anybody to record it for you? Will you watch it again?
F	The reason I ask, is I know Tracy Austin and John McEnroe were saying afterwards were very complimentary. They said there are areas to improve, but you will take a lot from that presumably when you listen to that.
F	Would you say you raise your game when you play here? If so, would you put that down to the crowd or other factors?
F	Do you feel like you're playing with a lot more people? Do you feel you have the country behind you a little bit more when you're on Centre Court?
F	When you come back next year, would you be hopeful of getting where Anne is this year and get straight into the main draw?
M	So near and yet so far. Two set points to make it two sets all.
M	Is there something about Wimbledon that gets to you, because your record is obviously consistent?
M	You're hovering on the cusp of the 250 mark in the world rankings. Do you feel you'll get another chance?
M	When you say, "get another chance," do you think you should get another wild card next year?
M	Do you still look forward to Wimbledon?
M	Have you spoken to Brad since you lost?
M	How much do you think you've developed under him? Do you feel you've made progress since working with him?
M	A lot of people are going to say obviously you've lost again today; the proof's in the pudding. Do you think that's a fair criticism of your relationship with Brad?
M	I know you speak highly of Brad. He's got a great track record as a coach generally. But do you feel extra pressure having such a big-name guy, given where you are in the rankings? That must surely weigh on you a bit, the fact that he's kind of there in your corner and he's costing you a lot of money.
M	You said Brad has made you more of a hard-working player, that your stamina is better. Has he actually technically improved you as a player?
M	People sometimes look at you in defeat and say you don't look as disappointed as you might do. Can you just talk about the level of disappointment you're feeling at the moment?
M	After your loss today, we heard some reports that there was a risk that your LTA funding might be withdrawn. Were you aware of that?
M	And so do you think the LTA should continue to support you as you try to move forward?
M	Do you feel yourself you can continue to get better?
M	This time next year, do you think you will have qualified for Wimbledon as of right and won finally a match at Wimbledon, as well?
M	There will be some celebration when you do finally win a match at Wimbledon, wouldn't it?
M	What deterrents do you think are in the works as to keeping British men from attaining what they can in tennis?
M	Davis Cup is going to be played here in September. A, are you available for selection; and B, should John Lloyd pick you?
M	There was a time when you said you didn't want to play Davis Cup for Britain a few years ago.
M	Bit of an up-and-down match there? Second set got away from you?
M	How are you feeling about your game right at the moment?
M	Things seemed to have changed around very quickly again this year, from mid clay court season when you were quite down about things to the way things are now. How has it changed so fast?
M	Is that the difference, that you get a little bit too down on yourself?
M	I think when people look at your game from the outside in in terms of on grass, they would deconstruct it and say everything is probably there to succeed.
M	Can I ask you about the Masters Cup when it comes to London this year, your experience of playing in China? What do you think of it coming here, and what can you remember were your main sort of memories of being involved?
M	Can you remember any sort of special memories of that week, the things they have you do?
M	Could we have your thoughts on the match.
M	When you're not serving well, what kind of things are going through your mind to try to get back?
M	Can you take us through your emotions.
M	A lot of us felt at the end of the fourth set that the momentum probably had swung back in your direction. How tough is Nadal in a fifth set?
M	Is there a feeling inside you that this is one that got away from you?
M	Did you think him playing 5 hours, 14 minutes late on Friday night, did you feel like his condition might go if you could stretch the match out long enough?
M	Did you feel he was getting stronger at the end?
M	Did it hurt more because it could have been the 14th for you and you have to wait for another time?
M	You mentioned you had problems with the first serve. You had only 52% of first serves in. You also had 19 breakpoints. That was happening on Nadal's serve. So what was the problem then? Only him serving well or you having some problems returning or what?
M	Do you believe you still can beat him?
M	Were you surprised at how easy the win was today?
M	How has your Davis Cup experience influenced you as a player and was what you did last December still helping you now?
M	Other than your own hard work, who do you feel you owe your progress to at this moment?
M	What's the difference in a tennis player or even in a man of being a left-hander? It is a small percentage of people.
M	What is your confidence level right now? What do you believe you can do in this tournament?
M	Will you watch tonight's game?
M	Do you think that will help you, knowing his game so well?
M	Your game adapts very well to all surfaces. What do you think is the single most important reason for that?
M	When you talked to Agassi in Las Vegas, was it about the Australian Open?
M	Are you working with Sven Groeneveld now?
M	When did it start?
M	Talk us through what happened there.
M	Did you hesitate to retire because of the possible criticism given some of things that happened last season?
M	Did it enter your head that you might face a lot of tough questions if you retired from the match?
M	You finished very late a couple nights ago. You were in the heat of the sun today. What did you think of the scheduling?
M	You said the other night that a compromise might be needed about the scheduling of the night matches. What do you think that should be?
M	Is this the most disappointing moment of your career?
M	How hard is it to defend a title now that you've had experience in trying to do it?
M	How did you feel before today's match? Did you have any occasion that you might be in trouble?
M	You go to practice yesterday, or not at all?
M	What was the explanation given for denying your request to play at night?
M	Are you saying that you think because there is an Australian playing tonight that the network that is broadcasting wanted her to be playing in prime time as opposed to you?
M	How do you feel right now? Did you get any treatment?
M	Do you want to talk about Andy being fitter and lighter this year, moving around the court better. Did you find him a different opponent to play against?
M	You just said you did get treatment. Did you get a drip or something like that?
M	Given what happened today, do you think the heat policy is adequate, or does it need to be revisited?
M	Were you happy with your preparation before this tournament? You arrived late and things didn't seem to go your way. Will you do things differently next year?
M	Everybody reacts differently to illness. Is it possible that you need to perhaps develop a greater trust in your body, a greater relaxed nature so you could perhaps play through these things a little bit more?
F	What are your thoughts on the early finish? Did you need more match play, or is it a blessing in disguise?
F	Are you somewhat of the quiet achiever in the draw? You're not getting any publicity. Are you happy with your form and how you're playing?
F	You play Serena Williams next. Your thoughts on that game?
F	I don't know your record against Serena, but I remember your match in Miami last year.
F	The Miami match was a terrific match.
F	It wasn't very much difference between the two of you. A match like that should give you confidence you can beat her.
F	What about the way she plays, her game style, how it fits into how you play, players you like or don't like to play?
F	What as Olga brought to your game?
F	She really was the first Soviet, Russian player, when she came along. Does she tell you stories about how tough it was?
F	What do you think about China's player today?
F	How confident were you going into the match, given that you were head-to-head with her 3-All?
F	Any particular part of your game that pleased you?
F	When did you realize she really wasn't going to come back into the game?
F	After your great run at Wimbledon two years ago, were you satisfied with how you went in the Grand Slams last year?
F	How determined were you in the off-season to come back and be a top-10 player again?
F	Was Monica Seles somebody you admired a lot? You seem to have a very similar style.
F	Australian season hasn't been a happy hunting ground for you. Now you made the final in Brisbane and now in quarterfinals. Do you sort of pinch yourself a little bit?
F	Do you feel in order to win matches against great players you have to be playing great on offense, or do you think defense now is a very important part of your game?
F	Winning against the world No.1, does this mean for you you can go all the way up? Is this something that pops up in your mind after a match like this?
F	Do you feel like if you play your best the next three matches that you really do have a chance to win the tournament?
M	Tell us about the game. You must be happy with the match.
M	You had some spectacular shots out there, throwing yourself around the court. Are you okay after all that?
M	Can you talk about the changes to your game since Roger Rasheed has become your coach.
M	How about the personal relationship between the two of you? Are you close off the court as well?
M	What did you think of the challenge call at the end of the third set? Did you know what was happening?
M	You had a rest?
M	What did he say to you when he came to the net?
M	How did Rasheed get you to play more up front, taking the balls early, rather than taking them from the fence? What about him made you change your entire tactics compared to previous coaches?
M	I understand you say you are ready to make that change. Do you regret not having made it earlier?
F	Didn't seem to get your form where you wanted to in the third set.
F	How did you feel you're playing in comparison to last year?
F	You staged a remarkable comeback last year against. When you broke her back in the third set, did you think you were coming back again?
F	She did play very well. Were you happy with your own level throughout the match?
F	So how disappointing is this for you, or is it just another maybe roadblock?
F	Are you surprised that after winning Roland Garros things have gotten more difficult?
F	Have you got anyone in your entourage that's been in a situation like this? You're not working with a coach, are you?
F	You looked a bit nervous out there.
F	Do you have any comments on the violence that happened today outside, and your thoughts on fans getting so upset they feel like they have to punch each other?
M	What are your thoughts about that?
M	Was your concentration always there? You seemed to be so comfortable that you just lost it a little bit sometimes.
M	Do you think that's because you didn't get a full match in the first round?
M	How do the night matches here compare to, for example, the US Open?
M	More sort of an educated tennis crowd maybe?
M	How much of a step in class will be in the next round against Melzer?
M	Have you been intrigued that Roger and Novak are a bit irritated that you're getting a bit more attention and people are suggesting you might even win this thing?
M	After two rounds of this tournament, it does look like sort of the top four players are all in pretty decent nick? None of the four of you have lost a set or looked at any trouble.
M	Was that the sort of match you were looking for tonight? It offered a complete range of shots out there.
M	Do you prefer playing at night than during the day?
M	How is your brain training going?
M	"Overnight" as in you were playing it through the night?
M	Is it supposed to be the same time every day?
M	How does it feel to be aging rapidly?
M	How does it feel to make the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time?
M	How did you make that big step? Why were you better than Nalbandian?
M	Could they do something about the game in your country generally speaking? And how you began to play? It's very popular there where you live?
M	Yes.
M	You said your friends. Were they watching you back in Taiwan?
M	Is this win better than the win over Andy Murray at the Olympics?
M	The last game of the match was very long. How important was it for you to win that even though you had the extra break? Did you feel you had to win then?
M	You served very well with the breakpoints down in the last game. You served very well then.
M	Are you the best player ever in Taiwan, or are there some others stronger than you as far as you know? What's the history of tennis in Taiwan? Why did you start playing tennis instead of another sport?
M	What was his name?
M	Is your father playing tennis, too?
M	And your family is rich? Could he afford to pay your expenses?
M	Taipei had has some really excellent little league baseball teams. Anybody try to recruit you for those little league teams?
M	Were your teachers all from Taipei? Did you learn to play tennis with some international coach? How many coaches were in Taipei where you were playing?
M	Was there a player you liked watching growing up?
M	Was Chang more popular than anybody else in Taipei?
M	Have you met him? Did you ever talk to him?
M	Do you have any relation with the girl tennis player, Chinese of the other China who won the Olympics?
M	You talked about your coach. Do you work only on private, or do you work also with the Federation?
M	If you had to play doubles with the Chinese players, the Chinese would allow that?
M	I'm asking if there is a political issue why they can or cannot play together?
M	I mean, in doubles you can play together?
M	Why do they call you Randy? You were baptized at a second name as Randy?
M	So they call you Randy?
M	What's the nature of the injury?
M	Do you think you will return?
M	Have you had surgeries or anything like that?
M	You worked this past year with the physio to try to get back to a playing level?
M	In the limited time you had on court today, what impression did you have of Andy Murray, and how different is he to the player you played at the US Open four years ago?
M	Do you think you should have played, in that you didn't expect to do much, and a fully fit player hasn't been able to play because you played?
M	Did you feel bad when you had to stop?
M	Was it embarrassing because of the crowd?
M	Are you going to stay in Melbourne for a little while?
M	Were you assured by anybody medically before you took the court today that you could probably last more than 45 minutes?
M	That's impossible.
M	Of course I try, yeah.
M	What is the actual nature of the back injury? Is it a disc?
M	So it goes into spasm?
M	Please don't tell us you're going to retire. Is this a final decision?
M	Happy with the game today?
M	How is the injury?
M	You've had such a great record here. Are you excited about your prospects next couple weeks?
M	What are your expectations for this season?
M	You have no sort of...
M	Have the last few years been too stressful for you?
M	Is it still fun for you to play tennis?
M	Twice you have a Davis Cup final and twice you won it. Are you going to play Davis Cup this season?
M	You touched on being stressed on the tennis court. Would you be stressed after 5 hours and 34 minutes like Lpez and Muller were today?
M	Why do you think we see some unusual finalists at this tournament?
M	What are you going to do after tennis? You don't have to tell us if you don't want to.
M	Don't do press conferences?
M	Would you say you don't enjoy yourself in tennis, or...
M	When you're done, will you spend the summer in the Himalayas? Are you going to do it again? Is it something that makes you excited?
M	Took you a long time to break, until the third set, but looked like you were going to win. How disappointing is it you couldn't finish the match from that?
M	You faced Davydenko and Del Potro the last two evenings. How do you see the final panning out now?
M	What will you keep from this Masters? Confidence? Disappointment?
M	The Masters, this competition.
M	It's obvious mentally you're tougher, you're moving better. But technically do you feel there's a small detail you're doing better? What have you improved technically in the past months?
M	It's been a long time since a Swedish player came to this tournament, Magnus Norman, your trainer. We were forgetting about Swedish players. But how do you see this?
M	He kept trying to get away from you, especially in the third set, and you kept coming back. What was the difference for you to keep pulling him back and pull off the tiebreaker in the end? What did you do to get back in the match to force the tiebreak?
M	How so?
M	What happened in the tiebreak?
M	Do you feel you lost an opportunity today to have a chance of getting to the semifinals?
M	How do you feel you've played overall in the two matches?
M	Did you hurt your leg in the third set?
M	What are your thoughts on playing Murray next?
M	What made the difference in the end?
M	What made the difference between you?
M	What was your strategy coming into the match? How were you going to try and beat Novak today?
M	Are you pleased with your week, the week as a whole? Are you pleased with the week?
M	Do you think you are back at your best ever?
M	Last year, were there times when you did not enjoy so much?
M	Are you looking forward to the Davis Cup match?
M	Looking forward to the Davis Cup?
M	When you talk about your problems with your mind, when it comes to the mind and injuries, what do you weigh first? Are you scared of the mind, or are you scared of the injuries?
M	How tough is it to switch from hard court to clay court?
M	So the real Novak Djokovic showed up tonight.
M	He came back at you quite strongly after the good start you had, didn't he?
M	You obviously can't play at your best the whole time. Do you find you're at the stage where you play as well as you need to be?
M	Are you fully comfortable with your new racquet, and what advantages does it give you over the old one?
M	And does it give you any advantages over your old racquet? Do you notice more power, more control?
M	Is this as well as you've played this year?
M	You have your prospects of winning this tournament improved by the withdrawal tonight of Andy Murray. Any comment on that?
M	And you feel confident now that you can go all the way?
M	I remember 12 months ago when you came here, I think you had just come from Moscow and you were very sick in Davis Cup and you talked about how one of the goals was trying to keep well, keep fitter. Have you changed your diet or anything? Have you looked into certain things, just to try and keep more healthy?
M	Goes without saying that it was a bit of a brutal day to play tennis, wasn't it?
M	As Nadal's peer and someone who has beaten him before, detail what it is that makes him so difficult to play.
M	You said at the beginning of the tournament you didn't expect to do very well here, considering your illness before. Are you pleasantly surprised with the way the tournament went?
M	You took a spill yesterday. Was there any lingering...
M	Pays to challenge calls, doesn't it?
M	How are you feeling?
M	How is your ankle?
M	Can you talk about Federer and Verdasco?
M	Can you talk just about individually? Obviously you played Federer and you played Verdasco, both. What do you feel like you have to do against both guys?
M	Are you at all surprised that you made the semifinals giving the build-up to the tournament?
F	First of all, congratulations. Can you just talk a little bit about the match? You were able to control it, for the most part, seemed like.
F	When you had your opportunity to close it out and you lost a couple of key points but you came back, do you have a system that you use when you've disappointed yourself that you didn't close it out, and now you come back again? Do you have a system?
F	You've got to be happy with the way you're playing this tournament. Looks like you haven't dropped a set. All your results have been looking really solid. Can you talk about the level of your game at this point?
F	Who do you have next? I forget.
F	Can you talk about playing against her? Have you played against her before?
F	Do you pay much attention to the tournament and how, like, some of the seeds have been falling and some of the other top seeds have been struggling? Do you pay attention to that at all?
F	With the way you're playing right now, how much do you think it helped that you came here a little bit earlier and got used to the conditions here in Indian Wells?
F	Your focus is on each point, each game, and not on the outcome. Was that a result of your coach or your own development?
F	How would you comment on your performance today against Shuai Peng?
F	Are you struggling with your game a little bit at the moment?
F	How about your serve? Are you happy with it right now?
F	This is another tournament where if you get to a certain stage you can be No.1. When it happens each week like this, is it becoming a bit of a burden for you?
F	This is such a big tournament, and yet Sveta lost, Elena lost, Jankovic lost, you're saying you didn't play your best today. Can you pinpoint a reason?
F	Are you feeling mentally tired at the moment?
F	What do you do to recharge your batteries when you're not on tour and constantly practicing? Do you have some rituals or activities you do to ground yourself, to center yourself?
F	What about the next round, which is against Jill Craybas? What are your thoughts about that?
F	On a physical level, you're stronger maybe than ever. How do you work hard if the tournament is so close? What do you do in the gym? How do you keep the regimen going on?
F	You've come so close to winning two Grand Slam titles recently. What do you think it would take to give you that next little bit of an edge so that you can finally win one?
F	What would you do differently the next chance, aside from winning?
F	What lessons have you learned from your brother's experiences?
F	Well, on that note, you know, you are slowly but surely becoming more famous than him. More in the spotlight. Do you tease him about this? Is there any little game about that?
F	When you go through a press conference like this and your brother is not brought up, no one talks about him at all, do go back to the locker room and celebrate?
F	Do you feel like more pressure as the No.1 seed? Does it affect you at all?
F	How are you influenced by the crowd? If the crowd is cheering for you, does that help you?
F	Do you wish Venus and Serena were here?
F	Have you been paying attention to the tournament and seen all the girls who have lost?
F	Do you socialize with Venus and Serena and the other top players?
M	Are you pleased with your match today and the fact you'll be in the final once again?
M	You said yesterday you made quite a lot of mistakes. Did you feel today that you eliminated, got rid of, the mistakes and it was a better performance?
M	How much do you feel you have improved since Monte-Carlo? You're playing Novak in the final again.
M	How do you feel the conditions are here comparing to Monte-Carlo?
M	Is it your favorite, or...
M	It's slower here?
M	Against Novak, what is the key for you?
M	Are you ready for the football game?
M	You looked after the first set. How did you turn things around?
F	(Through translation.) Was it difficult to beat her?
F	(Through translation.) If tomorrow goes well for you, you could even reach the final on Saturday. I noticed that in the past three finals you lost, so do you feel ready now for a new final? Do you think you could go all the way this time?
F	She seemed to be giving you a lot of problems with the variety of her match. She did a lot of different things with slices, dropshots, serve and volleying. Can you explain how a match can change so dramatically from 3-1 to her and breakpoints in the second set to you running away with it?
F	What was the difference on your serve, as well? You lost four of the first seven service games, and then I think it was ten or twelve double faults. After that you seemed to be fine on your serve.
F	(Through translation.) What's your opinion about the current situation of women's tennis in the world? Since the 20th of April you've been No.1. There's been alternating No.1s. Do you think you can now stay for a long time?
F	You called for the trainer during the second set. What was the problem with your foot?
F	So it was your ankle not your foot?
F	The last two days you've spent more than seven hours on the court. Doesn't it kind of beg the question, why are you playing the doubles? Isn't that a bit too much? Do you not risk getting bit to too tired?
F	(Through translation.) When you win, do you also find it important to get your brother's approval? Do you kind of, in away, do it for his approval, or for yourself?
F	Do you have arguments as to who is better?
F	So he wins the argument.
M	You must be been extremely happy with the way you stuck it out in this second tiebreak. Looked like it was all over there for a minute or two.
M	What about the tiebreak? A little nerve-wracking, the tiebreak. A couple net cords that helped you in th end.
M	You feel it's been a good preparation for the Australian?
M	A good win but a fairly frustrating kind of day?
M	What do you take out of that kind of game? I suppose that kind of game is a little help.
M	What did you think when you woke up and it was 40 degrees, beautiful day, and you had a rain delay, wind, there was everything today?
M	And the storms.
M	What's worse, do you think, playing in the heat or the wind is worse?
M	Do you look forward to the matchup in the next rounds for you?
M	Richard is sort of the is serve and volleyer.
M	He's more traditionally a serve and volleyer than a lot of other guys on the tour. You don't agree?
M	I was thinking, would you prepare for him different than someone like Lleyton, who's as baseline player?
M	What do you feel is going to help your game tomorrow? Do you think you have to work on something, take it as it comes?
F	You had long matches this week. Was it just too much tennis the beginning of the season, body reacting?
F	So you've got a few days to get it right before Melbourne?
F	That shouldn't be a problem.
F	What happens now rehabilitation-wise between now and Melbourne? Is it stretching? What sort of things do you have to do?
F	Can you ask for a late start in the singles?
F	Are you playing doubles in Melbourne?
F	Is it the first time this kind of injury happens?
F	So you were playing the final in Paris, it could be in the final Melbourne as well.
F	When will you decide if you're playing Melbourne?
F	How do you feel inside?
F	Are you disappointed to get an injury so close to a Grand Slam?
F	Is part of the thinking perhaps that sort of playing Sugiyama she can keep you out there for a long time?
F	What went wrong for you out there today?
F	Yeah.
F	Did you struggle to adjust from indoors to outdoors coming from Hopman Cup?
F	Just before the Australian Open last year, how did you sort of feel going into that tournament, and can you compare the feeling now to that?
F	How do you go about doing that in the space of a week?
F	Is it just a matter of the trying too much?
F	Was there any one particular thing in today's game, or just did nothing sort of work for you?
F	You get a win in the Hopman Cup. Did that sort of make you feel perhaps things were starting to come right and start play better tennis?
F	Going into the game today, did you sort of have a feeling you might not be quite right?
F	Is there someone that you go to for advice in that situation, whether it be a sports psychologist or a past player?
F	Do you think the doubles matches might help in a less-pressure atmosphere to rediscover the fun of being out there on the tennis court without sort of worrying too much?
F	Finding your mindset.
M	What happened when you lost 11 points in a row in the first set?
M	Is it just a matter of not having played on clay or not having played a match in a while?
M	Do you think people maybe expect you to always be perfect?
M	You don't play anymore with the straps on the knees?
M	Do you remember when it was when you played without them the last time?
M	Does it make a difference?
M	How important is it for you to set the tone here in Monte-Carlo for the rest of the clay court season?
M	How do you explain this lapse in concentration in this match?
M	What is your opinion on Murray's game on clay? What do you think he can do on clay?
M	Could you speak about your training routine off the court. What kind of things do you do? Do you do cycling or running?
M	No. Off the court when you're training, what is your sports training routine?
M	Was that one of your toughest ever turnarounds, between travel and the match?
M	Can you go through your trip? I know you left on Monday, I think.
M	BA or AA?
M	Did you come in with any expectations or you just want to give it a go and see?
M	How is your right leg? You had your treatment.
M	How is it now?
M	What made you decide to play in it last minute?
M	How did you feel having to play Marat Safin in the first round?
M	It was almost a strange thing waking up Monday morning and seeing that you and Ferrero had won a tournament. Has it given you renewed faith, hope in your game?
M	What is it about over the last few years you seem to be almost improving on clay.
M	Has it come to the point now where you if you were to have one more Grand Slam victory or a chance at a Grand Slam, it could be the French Open above others? Have you gone that far?
M	Your own sort of ability...
M	You say you didn't grow up playing on clay. What is the hardest thing you had to learn over the last few years?
M	What is your clay program going to be?
M	A lot of players who come from big injury setbacks like you've had, they come back and they say they actually enjoy their tennis more. Have you found that? Do you feel it's actually more of a buzz just being out there and being able to play?
M	Where do you think you are in that process?
M	I know it's a long way away, but how important to you these days is Wimbledon?
M	What does that feel like?
M	Your ranking, given where it is at the moment, it does offer you the opportunity of knocking off a seed and taking their path.
M	How frustrating was it not being able to get on court yesterday and having to come back this morning?
M	Got a break in the second game of the first set. That set you up for the match?
M	How important is starting off a match well to you?
M	What were you pleased about with that performance today?
M	Did you notice any difference between the outdoor and indoor courts in terms of speed?
M	What do you do you between now and waiting for the final?
M	Can you explain the ups and downs of that match. Looked like you were out of it, then you were in control of it.
M	Talk about his return game.
M	Did you feel a little stiff coming out? You looked a little tired.
M	What was it like playing two matches? What did you do between the two matches?
M	Can you talk about the seventh game of the second set, 10 deuces, then you broke him, and up three in the tiebreaker. What did you do to regain your confidence?
M	As much as you probably wanted to win tonight, do you feel it might have been a blessing that you won L.A., you won the US Open Series, a lot of attention on you right now, might take the spotlight off for the US Open, you can focus on your tennis?
M	He's serving 15-40 at 6-5. What was he able to do?
M	Crowd was rowdy. Do you like that?
M	Do you like the US Open for that reason?
M	Do you feed off the energy of crowds at the US Open then?
M	Have you noticed that as you shot up with the Samurai Club, is that something you've watched develop?
M	Pretty pleased with the way this week went overall? You played pretty well here, didn't you?
M	Did you make it to Taylor Swift last night?
M	How was it?
F	The service problems you were having today, how much was it you having them and how much was it her return game?
F	You lost your last two service games of the first set and all five service points in the tiebreak.
F	You didn't start grunting until the second set, and I thought that was going to be a sign that you were coming back. Could you say when you do and when you don't grunt?
F	No rhyme or reason?
F	Can you talk about your opponent's play today? Was she much tougher than the first three players you faced in this tournament?
F	It was strange. You seemed very in control. You were serving for the first set, and then it was -- it all seemed to go away. Did you feel that it wasn't happening today, or did she take it away from you?
F	On a day like this, do you feel the fire? We've seen you play with such fire at different times. It was hard to tell today. Were you feeling it, you know, as you do in the big matches?
F	You've played her many times over the years, and she's always had a really good ground game, but can you talk a little bit about the fact that she's serving better, does that make a difference in the matchup now?
F	Can you talk about how a match like this would change your preparation for the US Open?
F	What did you learn from playing her today? You said you learned a lot. You're going to take away a lot.
F	More pleasant to play in that kind of weather than a few days ago?
F	What kind of a weather player do you consider yourself? Do you consider on a hot day of the year an advantage over your opponent most of the time or a disadvantage?
F	Do you feel like it's hot? Because you're so -- I mean, every day you go to work. You're playing in the hot sun all over the world, so do you even notice it?
F	A lot of the top seeds have dropped out very early in this tournament. Your thoughts on that, the upsets?
F	This off topic a bit, but this tournament is thinking of switching formats in two years' time. One idea they have is that half of the men and half of the women will play in Toronto for a week and half of the men and half of the women will play in Montreal for the same week.
F	And then fly to the other city for the final on Sunday.
F	What do you think of that idea?
F	Do you know Dinara very well?
F	I mean, when she was here after her match, she was very upset and very hard on herself, you know, like really criticizing different parts of her game. Is that maybe an obstacle for her? Maybe she is too hard on herself maybe?
F	What is your take on Sugiyama's game today?
F	You had the tough match with Venus in the semifinal in Stanford and she played very well.
F	But I mean then she plays not very well the next day, and then she loses to Pennetta last week, and then plays terrible yesterday. Maybe you bring out the best in her. I don't know.
M	Very well done. Pretty intense finish, wasn't it?
M	As the match goes on and he gets sort of closer and gets into it, is there a risk that he becomes inspired if he gets into the match too much?
M	What does it mean to get to No.2 after all this work? You know, is it the best thing you've ever done so far?
M	Are you excited about it? I mean, does register with you that...
M	You've had some bad blood with Del Potro in the past. When situations like that occur, does that motivate you to play harder against an opponent in the event you do play Del Potro tomorrow?
M	You seemed really frustrated during yesterday's match against Davydenko. You traded breaks in the first set. It seemed like you were trading errors back and forth a little bit. You say that Tsonga was dictating a lot of the points, but did you feel more comfortable today like there were a few more surprises for you?
M	If you end up playing Del Potro, what will you have to do to win?
M	What about Roddick?
M	When you have a low percentage of first serves like today, is there anything conscious you can do to switch it around?
M	Looking forward to the US Open, if you go in as a No.2 seed, does that change your expectations for the tournament?
M	Do you feel that over the years you've done your part to get to the quarterfinals and finally the other guys came along or what?
M	Bit of a scare today against Stan?
M	Did it help you at all knowing his game as a doubles partner?
M	What your thoughts on your next opponent, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga?
M	Charlie Pasarell can remember every point he made and Lendl remembers every match and every score. How good are you about -- do you know of any other player nowadays who's good at, who knows every score, every set he played and all that?
M	It was a slow start?
M	(Indiscernible.)
M	Can we say this year that you've played as well as ever but not for long enough time in matches?
M	Once again, played well. He was coming back from a long letdown?
M	What made the difference in the third set? You were a break up.
M	What's your motivation going towards the US Open now?
M	How much would you like to win a title before you retire?
M	Can an old journalist make a suggestion here?
M	How about, when you get nervous, a little vodka?
M	Did you enjoy some part of the match tonight?
M	Your sister once said she never has a press conference without being asked about you.
M	Can you enjoy it when she's playing well like she has the past year? Is it fun to watch her?
M	Because after years when she wasn't playing so well, are you enjoying it now?
M	When she became No.1 and joined you as the only brother/sister as No.1, did you have a celebration together?
M	Now that you stopped, what about coaching her?
M	Tonight was a good test of character for you?
M	Were you worried after the first set? Were you worried that you could lose? You could be going home?
M	Tomorrow semifinal you will versus your good friend Feliciano, and Feliciano is also good at maybe big serve and also good at the volley. How will you face him?
M	Tonight and yesterday you played some amazing shots from impossible situations. Do you sometimes surprise yourself when you play these shots and you think, gee, that was -- and you're quite surprised?
M	Do you think you have a lot of energy saved as you were off the court for several months this season?
M	Have you been surprised by the reaction the Chinese fans have had to you over the last few weeks?
M	Coming back very strong in the third. It must be frustrating, two breaks down and then at the end it's a little...
M	You seem very disappointed. For me it's a sign of motivation. I was wondering, why would you want to stop if you're disappointed after almost beating Tomas Berdych? Don't you think you have it in here?
M	You didn't shake hands with Tomas after the match. Is that because of the injury timeout?
M	Have you decided which event will finish your pro tennis career?
M	You are a very private person. How hard for you to, like -- in one week you say good-bye to China fans twice in farewell ceremony.
M	Back to Berdych's injury -- or maybe it wasn't really an injury. How many times has this happened to you over your long career where opponents have kind of faked an injury and got a psychological advantage? Has it happened very often you to?
M	Do you find it a little ironic that at the end of your long career that the debate is now intensifying about the length of the calendar and a lot of players are saying perhaps there's too much tennis? I know you've been asked this question many times, but...
M	It's all your fault really after all these years?
M	I'm from Argentina, and I want to know, now that you are close to retirement, your memories of Buenos Aires, the times you were there and the Davis Cup matches with Argentina.
M	First of all, congratulations. You mentioned that the Chinese players need to be confident, and actually we are not as bad as those top players. What's the key factors for you to win this match today?
M	I've noticed that you are very aggressive to the serve from Dudi, and I want to know what you have discussed about the strategy and the tactics before the match.
M	You mentioned just now that Chinese male players are lacking of confidence. While you are No.396 and he is No.44, a number much higher ranking than you, do you think that the difference between you two is what your ranking reflected?
M	I know that in the Heineken tournament you also did a pretty good job, so compared to the previous titles you won and previous matches, is it different in today's match? Ranking doesn't represent your real strength, as you mentioned, but why is this such a difference in ranking?
M	(In English) Right now, what's your personal goal in terms of ranking or like to become top 100 player in the world or maybe -- or what's your goal right now?
M	Just now you also mentioned that ranking cannot represent the real strength of a player. You also said that you hope to have more opportunities to compete with the top players in the world. What's the reason that Chinese male players do not have the opportunity to play these high-level matches, not to mention ATP 1000 but ATP 250?
M	Well, your next opponent is Tsonga. It's really a top player. Have you thought about that match?
M	Just now you said that Chinese male tennis players need to have opportunities. Mao-Xin Gong, your colleague, will have to play with Safin for his first match. How would you comment on that? And if you have the chance to choose to whom you work for the doubles, which top player do you want to play with most?
M	When do you feel into this match that you are going to win? And when there are several deuce in the ninth games in the third set, there were several interesting shots, and you were also laughing at that time. What was in your mind at that time?
F	It was a strange match, a strange qualification for you, in the semifinals.
F	In the first game you lost very quick. Today you have done a great job. How did you step up your performance in just two days?
F	Would you say the conditions outside maybe are preventing people from playing their best tennis?
F	Last year you were the world No.1 in Doha. This year you are the last player to qualify here. How do you evaluate your performance in 2009? What's your expectation for next year?
F	Would it be fair to say after your first match you seemed to be thinking, I'm going into the winter layoff period now to regroup and plan for next year, then all of a sudden Dinara gets injured and Caroline gets hurt, if you like, and you win both matches? It's changed for you now, hasn't it?
F	But it's fair to say that the message you gave after your first match was qualification was beyond you?
F	Can you talk a little bit about the strength at the moment in women's tennis with Kim Clijsters back, Justine Henin returning next year. Is that a good thing or do you think that's going to make things a lot more tough for you?
F	Your start was excellent, but then you lost the rhythm of the game. What happened?
F	What happened to you emotionally at the end when you received those two code violations?
F	You were saying about your personality?
F	You were on the brink of qualification with match point. You probably would have gone through to the semifinals had you taken that point. Must be quite frustrating for you?
F	This is strange because you won more points than your opponent. What do you think about these stats?
F	Every player can learn a lesson from each match. What would you say the lesson you learned from today is?
F	Are you angry against yourself for letting it slip through your fingers?
F	The two of you are good friends, best of friends on the tour. Is it more difficult losing a match against somebody who you view as a very close friend than it is to lose against an ordinary player?
F	You're not sure if you're going to play with Safina or Zvonareva. Doesn't make any difference for you?
F	You know Caroline pretty well also on court. In which ways could you feel that she was injured today in certain parts of her game? And do you normally play that many dropshots?
F	And dropshots?
M	We're so used to seeing Roger keeping his emotions under control. What was your reaction when you saw him slam his racquet down?
M	Were you pleased? Because you started a little shakily today. Took a wee bit of time to get into rhythm or confidence.
M	Did you feel like in the second set there was a key game? I think it was 4-2, five breakpoints. Did you feel like that was the key to the match. Did you feel him unravel after that on the court?
M	Is that a shock when you see a player like Roger Federer with his class and greatness give you just points on some of those forehands that he would never miss a few years ago?
M	Two days ago Roger said that he thought he had your game figured out. Do you think you surprised him a little today?
M	He's been somewhat unpredictable lately. How does that change your attitude going into a match? Do you tend to want to sit back and see what he's doing, or go and play your game anyway?
M	Did you sense his frustration even before he mangled the racquet? Did you sense that the frustration was mounting from him?
M	Just considering the conditions were quite gusty, did you feel like he was pressing more? You said you were the more patient player. Did you feel like you managed the conditions better than he did?
M	What about the chance to win this tournament after maybe a bit of a slow start on the season. Talk about that.
M	Can you assess your chances against Del Potro or Andy? You've played them both.
M	Did you sea Rafa's match the other night?
M	Any thoughts on that?
M	Can you talk a little bit about coping being away from home for so long? Obviously you got your team here and other great Serbian players and the fans wherever you go. Is there anything about home that you miss, such as food, music...
M	What do you like to have, and do you get to have any on the road when you travel?
M	I think there are two Serbian restaurants in New York City. When you were at the US Open, did they invite you? Have you been there?
M	You talked about Andy's drastic improvement. Do you think it's a mental thing for him? Has he made changes in his game in terms of shot-making?
M	For a long time Roger Federer's forehand was considered the best shot he had, which is saying a lot. But you're not afraid to play him in long rallies to his forehand. You don't mind that forehand battle. Doesn't that change the psychology now when you play him?
M	You've been No.3 for almost two, three years. Do you feel like No.2 is within reach?
F	What was going through your head after you got match point? You kind of fell to the court.
F	You're pretty exhausted?
F	You had the trainer out a couple times. Can you tell us a little bit about what was going on?
F	What does Wozniacki do well?
F	Do you feel like you've got a pretty good shot at making the finals if you continue to play well?
F	You won the title here before. Tell us what it means to play here in Miami? Do you like the night life? The conditions? How does that work for you?
F	Seems like you kind of fall under the radar. Do you like that? Does it bother you?
F	How about specifically here. You're a past winner and you're playing really well.
F	How is it going with Olga?
F	As of when?
F	In your life?
F	Are you if the market for anyone?
F	So will you go back to someone at Casal, or...
F	But you would try to find one as soon as possible, or you'll be on your own for a while?
F	Changing the subject, a lot of celebrities like to come to this tournament. Have you met any? Have any come to see you personally?
F	Who was that?
F	I know Shakira was here yesterday. Do you think that's part of the excitement of this tournament for fans, to people watch and star...
F	Is it as fun for you to meet a star, do you think, as it is for them to meet you?
F	Who was the singer?
F	What's the name?
F	When was that?
F	I love them; they're great. (Laughter.) It's a he?
F	Has he come to watch you play tennis?
F	Can you talk a little bit about the semifinals? You're going to play either Azarenka or Stosur.
F	Electronic line calling, do you feel it's just a normal part of game at this point? I mean, it's been around a few years. Hawk-Eye.
F	Three. Have you ever been on a court that didn't have it and you started to do it and they said, Oh, no?
F	But why do you think the players do so poorly at getting the call right?
F	The players?
F	Ana, talking about the match. You must be pretty frustrated?
F	Do you think that because you played for so long at Indian Wells you didn't have the time to prepare for this tournament?
F	Can you look back until after the French when everything was on a high and maybe you lost some momentum with the injury and things haven't quite settled for you, even with last week's good result?
F	How are things with Craig, and what are his thoughts after the match?
F	You've talked about struggling with separating your tennis life and your personal life and staying up thinking about it when you go to bed. Is that related today that?
F	In a few weeks, Jelena and you will be trying to get Serbia into the World Group for the first time. Can you talk about what that would mean for you and also for Serbia?
F	That was the largest Fed Cup crowd ever.
F	What was that like? What did it feel like?
F	Do you like that team? Because when Jelena and you are basically competitors. I mean, most of the year. Then you have to kind of come together as a team. Do you like that concept? Is it hard for you or what?
F	Is that just solely playing for Serbia? Some countries, their federations have a lot of money to pay the players. I assume your federation doesn't. It could be an expense-only thing. Does it matter to you?
F	Speaking about something very special in a few weeks, you have opportunity to defend your title at the French Open. How excited are you about that?
F	Do you see any parallels with you and Jelena with the struggles at the start of this year and last year when you both got to No.1, first Grand Slam? Are there some parallels there?
F	Do you see a new wave of young Serbian girls wanting to follow in your footsteps that you have a chance to mentor like you haven't had?
F	Who was the 15 year old?
F	You've also created a name for yourself on the humanitarian side. Can you talk to us a little bit about your humanitarian efforts and what causes are specifically important to you?
M	How were you feeling out there under the sun?
M	How did you prepare to play Gulbis?
M	Do you expect to get very far? I mean, what are your expectations for the tournament?
M	Do you find it difficult having achieved so much coming to this press conference here and there's three or four people? Does it seem weird, or do you look at it as it's a whole new journey and an exciting journey?
M	If I could just ask, at one point you seemed like you were ill. Were you feeling sick on the court today, or did you have any condition? Was there a turn in the match for you that you could attribute to physical problems?
M	Can you take positives out of this tournament? You've reached the quarterfinals here for the first time. I know it's very soon after the match, but can you take some positives out of the way you played the tournament in general?
M	Is the abdominal, the stomach muscle, the reason you're not playing Davis Cup, or is that because of the foot?
M	You just decided you needed a bit of a rest?
F	I was betting you were going to the semifinal. Were you?
F	You both went out with maybe a potential match with Bondarenko or Wozniacki. Did that put you under more pressure to win today?
F	You were down 2-5. She also swept away a match point. Did that shake your confidence at all?
F	At the beginning of last week, would you have thought you could be here now in the quarterfinals?
F	When you look at what Oudin did here, do you take inspiration from that?
F	Where did you learn to speak so well English?
F	In Tampa with a trainer?
F	Why did you go there? Capriati?
F	That was a mature decision. Was it your decision?
F	What was the reaction of your father?
F	What did he do in Belgium?
F	You said he was a builder?
F	Construction?
F	It was a big bet, you being nine years old, to expect you could become a tennis champion and leave everything.
F	How did your mother die?
F	As you played so many match points in this crucial game in the second set, did it get easier? Harder? Same? What was that like?
F	Do you feel like you waited until that point to bring out your most aggressive tennis? Because she was doing some dictating before that.
F	How did you deal with playing in the big stadium?
F	So could you enjoy it the whole time, or did it make you a little bit nervous?
F	Outside of Italy, do you feel an Italian presence here maybe more than other stops on the tour?
F	No, fans.
F	How is the popularity of women's tennis in Italy since you're a top 10 player?
F	Coming into this tournament, it's not like last year. This time you've been playing so well, you're top 10, you won the big U.S. hardcourt tournament. Maybe there's expectations you that you should reach the quarterfinals. Do you feel that?
F	So after the tiebreaker when she starts getting very angry, did you sense that? How did it affect you?
F	But this one might have been a little different when she was taking the bandages.
F	I know you had a couple wins over Venus, but Serena is maybe at a different level.
F	What about the injury? How bad is it? Or is it just something small?
F	You.
F	So the leg was cramping?
F	Did to get a little bit chilly in the end?
M	You're probably not accustomed to playing at 11:00 in the morning, especially on Labor Day weekend. Did that affect the first set, the start time?
M	You've beaten an elite player in Lleyton many times in a row now. I suppose that gives you a little extra satisfaction.
M	What makes it such a good matchup for you?
M	Jesse Witten, who ranks 276 and got to the third round, was saying the nicest thing about being here was the free fresh laundry. Did you ever go through things like that when you were a young player and trying to get things and you didn't have much?
M	You had that incredible breakthrough win at Madrid, and then the finally winning Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and then topping it off with Cincinnati. Incredible run of professional success. On the other hand, you have this life-changing experience that's becoming a father of twins. Can you possibly compare the emotions of all this incredible professional success on the one hand and the personal feelings of becoming a father for the first time?
M	Yes.
M	What do you think was the key for you being able to grind out a win today against a quality opponent, playing tough, when maybe your game wasn't firing on all cylinders?
M	You're two steps away from another major semifinal. Of all of your many accomplishments, how would you describe the importance to you of that record streak of semifinals at the Majors?
M	If it is James Blake, how would you describe James as a person and James as a tennis player?
M	Is there a special feeling about two of you, Lleyton and you, he's on his way to the Hall of Fame, as you are, too, two champions on the same court?
M	Did you have a chance to see Rafa last night, and do you think he's back in shape?
M	The process of choosing two balls to serve, some players think it's a big deal. Everybody kind of examines them and takes an extra one. Some players say it's the fluff, some believe it's a ritual or superstition. What's your philosophy when you're hitting balls?
M	I think it was on the first set point, maybe third set. You went into the net and he hit a lob over you. Looked like you thought to yourself, I should know better than that. This guy is a good lobber. Did you have that thought go through your mind?
M	Is he far and away the best lobber?
M	I'm wondering, parents having one child is daunting enough, but having twins is amazingly daunting. Here you have broken the Grand Slam record. People look back and say, Wow, having a child, that's the greatest thing in life. I'm wondering if that eclipses this recent title you've won of making 15 titles? And No.2, who gets up in the middle of the night to feed the twins? Do you ever take part of that?
M	Have you been losing sleep?
F	Bigger than your win over Jelena in Wimbledon? How do you compare them?
F	Can you talk about exactly what the problem is and how it might affect you going forward?
F	No.4 in the world just was very gracious in describing the match and said you most definitely beat her. She did not beat herself. How does it make you feel to have a player of that stature make a comment like that about your game?
F	What do you think when you saw your draw before the tournament? What do you think about it now?
F	You said you can't believe that you won, but before the match I think you believed you could. So why did you believe you could?
F	Is there something that happened this summer that sparked all of this? Why are you having such a breakout year this year?
F	Talk about the shoes. They say "believe" on them.
F	Is that your saying or somebody's...
F	You have this specialty of taking down really good, really famous Eastern European mega stars. There is a player in the drawer, I think her name is Sharapova. Would you like to play Maria? And secondly, at Wimbledon after you won all that money, you said you'd stick with your old Toyota. Are you going to stick with it now, or are you going to upgrade?
F	You said you have no fear, and you went out there and you weren't supposed to win. Now as people are watching you and you're making these upsets and showing yourself that might change, how do you think you're going to deal with that?
F	Between Wimbledon and now, can you talk about what happened between Wimbledon and now? Were you getting close to winning matches, or were you having some issues with running out of wildcards? What was your time between Wimbledon and now like for you?
F	Yeah.
F	So you were happy with how that was going? After Wimbledon you have a breakout. Were you happy with the way things have led up to here?
F	Could you talk a bit about Justine Henin? I understand she was kind of a role model for you, what you liked about her game. I assume part of that was that she is not the tallest person in the world and had great results.
F	How much have you been in Ashe Stadium in the past?
F	Been there as a spectator a few times?
F	What was it like just walking out there?
F	Time and again we've seen players on the verge of a big upset, and the moment just gets too big for them. Obviously it didn't today. The last few points, what were you telling yourself, just how to stay in the moment? What were you telling yourself?
F	What did you prove to yourself today, do you think?
F	Are you familiar with Marietta?
F	Would you classify yourself now as bigger than the big chicken?
F	People have been writing and saying since Wimbledon that you're the next lady to move in and take the place of Serena and Venus. I just wonder, are you paying attention to that? Is it hard not to? Does it affect you at all? Hey, I've got to move up and I have to do this?
F	Are you going to go ahead and play doubles?
F	Why?
F	Do you have an identical or fraternal?
F	She plays tennis also?
F	Can you tell us about her a little?
F	There is a certain symmetry with two 17-year olds playing two Russian powerhouses in the same day. How well did do you know Christina? Do you think that this will be an inspiration to her going into tonight? Do you plan on speaking with her?
F	Have you played her before?
F	How did you do?
F	And the bigness of the moment, she certainly is prepared for it. How did you overcome sort of the bigness of this place and keeping your mind so that you didn't let it overwhelm you?
F	What's your injury? Just a strained thigh or what?
F	You spoke before about writing "believe" on your shoes. Can you describe what the belief is and what it means to you?
F	Could you talk a little bit about your team? What's the strength of Brian in your coaching? Is it helpful going out on tour and having a boyfriend? Does that help you out in your whole life and tennis life?
F	What's his name, first off? Have you had a chance to check your phone? And if so, what were the texts and the messages you got since you've walked off the court?
M	Bit embarrassing, because we don't know how is your mood. Would you say it could have been the last one? Is it the last one?
M	What is your feeling right now for both situations, the loss and the last Slam?
M	How do you feel about...
M	I'm just asking.
M	Your emotion, do you feel on the court?
M	You're going to play some more tournaments in your career?
M	How do you feel about that huge public support?
M	If you had to go back and change one thing in your career, aside from not getting injured...
M	You'd do it the same way?
M	What's been your favorite site on the tour and your least favorite?
M	Best spaghetti on the tour?
M	When did you decide that you were going to retire? Was it something you thought about? Went back and forth on? Or you just sort of one day said, You know, what, this year is it. I'm done.
M	What is so boring for you now that you don't want to play tennis anymore? About tennis, I mean. You did many things. You played so many years. But still, some people, Agassi played until 36; Connors 39. So they were probably different.
M	They're different. So what is different? Why is it boring for you to keep playing? I mean, you say, I want to change. I want to go and live another life.
M	What are you going to do?
M	Djokovic said yesterday you told him you were going to go and climb a mountain South America; is that right?
M	Stefan Edberg, when he retired, he announces it a year before he did. He had a farewell tour.
M	Very tired.
M	How do you feel now? You wish you hadn't said it beforehand?
M	Do you wish you would have waited till the very end to say you were going to retire?
M	I'm sure you will not miss some of the questions. What will you miss most from the tennis?
M	So you once said that if it weren't for tennis you'd be picking up bottles in a park in Moscow.
M	So overall, it's been worth it? All the travel that you have?
M	Great achievement?
M	Will you stay here to watch your sister's matches, and how do you feel about how she struggled in her match?
M	Yesterday she was asked though if you had given her any advice about the difficulty of being No.1. She said, Sometimes I don't understand what my brother says. So could you tell us what the advice was? What advice would you give her?
M	Your match against Pete in the final here, where does that match fit into your career, do you think? How do you view it now that you look back on it?
M	So Marat, was the victory in Australia in 2005 more satisfying?
M	Do you think you have changed a lot as a person all these years?
M	If the young Marat Safin could see Marat Safin now, what do you think he would say? What would be his thoughts on you as a person and a player now?
M	So how did the miracle happen?
M	Is there any way that the second half of your life could be as interesting as the first?
M	You had many hilarious press conferences in the past in those 12 years or 10 years. Is there...
M	Is there anything that you regret you said years and years ago, one place or another, that today you would never say it again or not?
M	Is this an exciting time in your life, knowing that you're still young and you have your whole future ahead of you...
M	How difficult was to be No.1? You were young. And then you talk about your sister; she's No.1. You told us also about the papers writing about your private life. And also you remember Safinettes, the girls?
M	So for your sister, it is not the same problem. At least she doesn't have all these boyfriends and pictures.
M	Luckily she doesn't have all those boyfriends as you had girlfriends.
M	Happy with your play? Medium? Real happy?
M	When he had breakpoints?
M	Seemed like you played the critical points well. Was there a greater focus on those points?
M	You said last week you're learning to anticipate a little better, makes you look faster. What goes into that?
M	The whole process of your rise, obviously it's a process, but how much do you think last year's run here had to do with kicking things up?
M	Can you talk about this year. Seems a little bit like you've had two parts. The majors probably didn't go quite the way you were hoping. The summer was phenomenal. Talk about the transition you made.
M	If you were made a tournament director for a day, what would the atmosphere be like during tennis matches? You seem to have a different take on what you'd like to see tennis evolve into.
M	What about waving white towels when you're trying to serve?
M	Are you prepared to deal with the likely stories and pressure of the next great American guy?
M	You haven't felt any pressure at all?
M	When Andy was your age, he won a slam. Do you ever think of that?
M	How do you look at that but then not put more pressure on yourself?
M	The typical theory is a big, tall guy, the mechanics of it, they're not as quick. What do you do about that? Do you specifically work on things like footwork and movement or do you just play tennis and let it flow?
M	Do you think possibly the stance you take on pressure, your family is out there, a nice atmosphere, do you think the fact you did not grow up in one of those tennis concentration camps, you just went to high school and played, do you think that makes a whole difference in attitude and approach to the game?
M	Play all four years?
M	Did you ever lose?
M	There's one thing you do have to overcome. You're a Clippers fan.
M	But you are a Clippers fan, you admit that publicly?
M	How did you come to hit two home runs at Dolphin stadium last year?
M	When was the last time you swung at live pitches?
M	You want fans to chant, Sam, bring some of that football?
M	Have you talked to the USTA?
M	Do you think that could work in golf?
M	You said you thought you were playing well the first half of the year but perhaps the results and wins weren't necessarily showing. Was there a sense of urgency to get those wins or results, people who aren't quite as familiar with how well you're playing, to show them your game has improved?
M	You lost all those matches, up a set and a break?
M	So far what has been your most difficult tournament to play in?
M	Is closing out a match mental? What kind of a hurdle did you have to overcome?
M	You were telling yourself forehand, forehand, forehand?
M	How is the traffic compared in New York to Los Angeles?
M	Santa Monica?
M	Knowing who you're playing, realistically, what is your goal going into that match?
M	What was your mindset, because the first set passed very quickly? What was your mindset?
M	Were you overwhelmed when you walked out there? What were your first impressions?
M	Two quick things: Did you have a chance to hit on Ashe at all before the match?
M	And related to the nerves, how does that manifest itself in your game when you are nervous, like today? Is it you overhit or underhit or footwork, or can you at all identify the way it affects your play?
M	Sure.
M	When was the first time you were here ever, Flushing Meadows?
M	Did you ever come as a fan prior to that?
M	Was there a danger of trying to think who you're playing instead of thinking about your own game?
M	You've seen him obviously on TV, et cetera. In facing him, what did you think of his game? Everything you read about?
M	Who's the best player you've ever played before Federer?
M	And how would you describe the difference? Is Roger in a group...
M	When did you find out about the draw that you were playing in? Who told you? What was your first reaction?
M	Did he say anything to you after the match? What did he say?
M	When you got that break in the second set, the first break, the crowd was going wild, up 3-1, then you proceed to lose the next six games. What was going on in your mind when you get the break? What happened?
M	Is he even better than you anticipated? I mean, you probably expected him to be Roger, but was it even more impressive in person?
M	You play an unconventional game, especially today, depending on serve and volleying. I was specifically wondering, so you trained with Nick Bollettieri and at the academy. How did Nick, who is such a proponent of power baseline tennis, how did that work in terms of developing a serve and volley game?
M	Have you met a lot of people coming up serving and volleying?
M	Why is that?
M	Have you had any conversations with Taylor about it, Taylor Dent?
M	What's your schedule? Are you going to stay here in New York for a few days? What other tournaments will you be playing coming up?
M	You said a few things that his game was pretty out there and that it was also kind of scarey, but what are the two or three things that are the most astonishing things about Federer's game?
M	So you think you're going to have some bad dreams about that forehand?
M	Does his ball feel any different than anybody else's? Is it heavier? You have a vantage point very few people actually really have. What does it feel like?
M	I have to ask, what was the difference between hitting with both of them? Obviously you're playing one and hitting with the other.
M	When you were out there, did you ever say to yourself, I mean, this is unreal, this is a dream I'm outplaying Fed?
M	What has this experience meant to you in terms of developing as a better player both mentally, physically, you know, tactically and so forth?
M	Is it humbling?
M	Did Rafa offer any advice? What did he say?
M	Was this ultimately encouraging to you, getting out there to play with the best?
M	How did you set it up to hit with Nadal?
M	What day was that?
M	Now that you've played against two of the best players in the world, I guess this is an interview question: Do you see yourself in 10 years being on their level or sooner?
M	Specifically, though, do you have any particular goals? Are you hoping to get top 50 or something like that?
M	How did you get interested in tennis as a five year old?
M	What was your Ole Miss Schedule? Did you enter in the fall or in the spring and how did that go?
M	Who is your mixed doubles partner, and when are you going to find out about the wildcard?
M	When you broke him limb, was there a thought, Hey, maybe I can actually...
M	Tough match obviously. What were you trying to do going into the match tactically to try and get back on the winning side against Roger, obviously a tough opponent?
M	Was the difference just the serve? I think you were only broken once in each set. You seemed to serve pretty well yourself.
M	Is there a bit of a mental block in terms of the record now, thirteen in a row, and you've had some close matches and haven't got over the line?
M	What did you think about the rhythm you built up this week?
M	In the beginning of your series with Roger you were dominate early. I know he's gotten better and you've get gotten better, too. Can you think of what you did when you won against him that you weren't able to do today in terms of how well you played against him?
M	Serving at 2-3 in the first set, you thought you had leveled; he challenged, overturned the call, and went on to break. Was that a significant momentum change, or did you quickly forget about that and move on?
M	Prior to your match with Sam, he said that you and Safin probably wouldn't be seeded at the US Open and you were two people he wanted to avoid in the US Open. How did you feel your chances are in the Open obviously coming back from the injury last year? Are you satisfied with the game where it is right now? And then also, what do you think about the Open?
M	Did the rain throw you off a little?
M	You played Rafa four or five times now. Did he seem the same today as he has in the other matches?
M	From and outsider's perspective, it looked like his timing and fitness was good, but he wasn't moving as good as he had. Is that how it felt to you?
M	The match turned on really just a couple points in both sets. Do you take encouragement from that, or how disappointing is that?
M	I think Rafa can be intimidating to other players. Do you feel that way, and it is the same?
M	You didn't have a set point in the second set, did you?
M	You did in the first set?
M	Has your impending retirement changed the way you view individual matches or tournaments? Do you put more emphasis on them, perhaps?
M	You're retiring at the end of this year. Has that fact changed the way you play or view a match, tournament?
M	You talked about your lack of confidence days ago, but today you seemed very confident. What did you change?
M	What do you think you'll be doing this time next year with competitive tennis behind you?
M	On that note, you played Pete Sampras in L.A. a couple weeks ago. Did he offer any advice or encouragement about how to handle post-retirement?
M	What will your band be called?
M	I know you went on a big mountain climbing expedition a while back. A year from now you're not gonna be playing tennis. Any other hobbies that you can elaborate on that you'll be doing to get away from the game?
M	This is a totally different topic, and you may have no opinion. I'm wondering, in recent years, have you noticed players making more use of the injury time-outs? Is this an issue for you that has bothered you? It seems sometimes there are injury time-outs when people are mainly tired. Is it unfair for an observer to wonder?
M	It doesn't affect the mentality or the momentum?
M	Were you happy with your first serve percentage tonight? Seemed a little low, 55%?
M	Yesterday in here your sister said that she senses that you respect her a lot more than you did a few years ago. That true? And if so, why?
M	She said that she felt when she would tell you when she was younger that she was gonna be a top 10 player that you didn't take her seriously, and she has proven to you that she was serious.
M	Did you ever feel as if she was trying to be your shadow or she wanted to emulate you, to be like you, or do you feel like she was always her own person?
M	You've had your motivational ups and downs in your career. What do you think keeps someone like Federer so motivated all the time?
M	About what?
M	More than a lot of other people that are playing?
M	But Murray is young 20s and Roger is 28.
M	Were you describing yourself as maybe someone that finds it sometimes stressful and doesn't enjoy those moments always?
M	How did you last this long at this level?
M	Do you have any goals for the rest of this season other than to just enjoy it, as you said? Do you have any on-court goals?
M	What's your last event?
F	Your thoughts on your win today? Seemed like you were doing really well with both your serve and service returns. You broke seven times today.
F	How much easier was that match than the other ones you played against her?
F	You seem like you were just placing the ball really well and she was struggling on the other end. Were you surprised at the difference?
F	What are your thoughts of Cincinnati so far in your first visit? Have you gone anywhere outside the tennis center, or just working hard practicing and playing matches?
F	So if you made the semis he had to go...
F	When you get this far in the tournament, how important does winning the tournament become?
F	Could you please evaluate Caroline's second serve? Is her second serve weak?
F	She beat you twice lately in Miami and Charleston. Did you play a little bit different strategy this time, or it was better execution of same strategy?
F	Are you surprised by the results of the tournament so far? For example, the departure of the Williams sisters from the tournament?
F	Did you think that Kim Clijsters can win this tournament?
F	What do you think about your serve today?
F	How did you get out of that?
F	What was happening at first? Why was it such a bad day?
F	On days like this, do you wake up feeling rubbish?
F	I don't know if I missed it, what did your coach tell you down Love-3 in the second set? That's when it turned around.
F	I saw a strapping on your hand. Is everything okay with your hand, or is that for protection?
F	What happened to the coconut?
F	So now you've been in two of the last three Grand Slam finals. Are you ready to make it to the US Open and get in a final and possibly win?
F	After Marat's match last night, he had some harsh words for the critics that you have. I don't know if you heard what he had to stay, but how do you feel about that?
F	Yeah.
F	I don't want to repeat the words he used.
F	What do you say to those that criticize you?
F	Did you watch Kim's match last night?
F	Were you surprised by the result?
F	Two years.
M	How will you sum up the totality of your game today?
M	Your game today.
M	How would you compare it with the one with Djokovic?
M	Did you detect any weak links at all in his game today?
M	Would you hold out any hope for Roddick or Murray in the final?
M	More trouble, but not beat him in the end?
M	Can you compare your last match at Roland Garros with Federer and this one? What were the differences?
M	Seems like when he hit the big forehand, inside-out forehand, he was reborn. After that he was playing again unbelievable tennis.
M	Did you go into the game thinking he just might beat me, or you went there with so much confidence that you will do your best? How did you approach it?
M	What would your advice be to whoever plays him in the final?
M	If you could give them one tip.
M	You won Halle and had a terrific run here. If Andy Murray comes through, how important do you think Queen's is to him?
M	Would you like to come back to Wimbledon?
M	Can you sum up your whole Wimbledon experience. It's been a special one for you.
M	How would you assess your performance today?
M	As a Grand Slam champion yourself, do you normally feel nervous at the quarterfinals of a tournament?
M	Were you surprised at how aggressive he was playing and how he stayed aggressive all the way?
M	Was there any particular reason you weren't able to force him on that second serve?
M	That's two defeats to Tommy Haas on grass in quite quick succession. Is his game particularly suited to grass, and why?
M	So is your game suited to a hard court better than grass?
M	When you were first rising up into the top five, your personality on the court and around the tour seemed very outgoing and fun-loving. Have you deliberately toned that down? And if you have, why?
M	Do you think Tommy has any chance in the semifinal?
M	You and Ana and Jelena had great results. You really captivated our attention. Now you're having some tough times. Can you reflect on that.
M	Do you feel the results from Jelena and Ana?
M	Do you think you may change anything in your preparation to your grass season in the future or is it not worth the time because it's so short?
F	Can you talk about the match today and how you felt.
F	What did you think of her game? This is the first time she's ever won a match at a Grand Slam.
F	And what was that?
F	Did you feel she was a little tired in the end?
F	Talk about Venus next. You've had some experience playing her.
F	How do you see that match, or what do you think you have to do to get past Venus? She's won here five times, including the last two years.
F	When you play Venus, do you think it's more mentally challenging than other players? You played Venus before, and now you're meeting here. Mentally is it the same with you if it was any other player other than Venus?
M	Can you give us your impressions of the match?
M	How good was he, do you feel?
M	Do you think you could have been playing the future champion?
M	Is there any area of his game at all that anybody can work on or is there no weakness there?
M	Did you go out there with a particular game plan for Murray today?
M	No aftereffects after playing five sets on Thursday? You felt okay?
M	It was hot out there. How hot did it feel on court?
M	Do you think the heat was a factor for your opponent?
M	Fairly evenly matched throughout almost all the three sets. But your experience, do you think was what won you over and he was frustrating himself and that affected his game?
M	You beat him in Munich in straight sets as well.
M	What's the difference then? How did you beat him if he's such a great opponent?
M	When you were having hip problems and surgery, how realistic did you think it was that you'd be in a position like this going into week two at Wimbledon?
M	How do your emotions and feeling of accomplishment compare now, having done it after what you've been through, with when you were a much younger player?
M	How much did the support you had out there help you?
M	Three straight-set wins. How does progress the second week this year compare to previous years, and in particular 2002?
M	Parallels with 2002 at all?
M	There's always a lot of talk about the surface, how it's changed over the years. Where do you lay in sort of on this question of it being slowed down from the way it used to be?
M	Going back to the group of fans, do you know any of them? Are they just sort of a little group?
M	There was a point when one of the stewards apparently asked them to quiet down a bit. I presume you wouldn't want them quieted down at all.
M	Does it get distracting when they start singing pop songs and stuff?
M	It's been pretty rare that someone has finished the year No.1 and regained it. You have a unique perspective on that. What are the variables that make that so difficult?
M	Is it injuries? Is it mental?
M	You haven't played Stepanek for quite a while. What do you expect from him?
M	He talked about struggling through his match on a bad knee, getting his doctor in from Prague. Can you let that enter your head?
M	Do you feel fit enough now to go deep into the second week? Do you think your body is up to doing that?
M	You mentioned the amount of work you've had to do. Having had the career you had before having serious surgery, it would be very easy to go, That will do me, and walk away from it. Where does the hunger to do all that hard work come from?
M	Do you set your goals down in terms of getting back in the top 10, or is it the slams?
M	What is your sense of appreciation for Roger's accomplishment as he approaches the possibility of breaking Sampras' record for majors, given your experience in majors?
M	When you watch him play, what do you appreciate most?
F	Can you tell us about the knee strapping? Preventive? Something bothering you?
F	What's the problem?
F	There's nothing you aggravated, was there, the other day?
F	You seemed pretty comfortable today. Is that kind of match a good workout for you at this stage of a tournament?
F	You said that the strap was just for support. What caused you to use it, and how did your condition change so that you did use it this time and you haven't before?
F	Why did you need the support when you haven't in the past?
F	What sort of pain were you feeling?
F	It's nothing serious?
F	Larry Scott gave his final press conference this morning. You were the one current player he singled out for having a leadership role, being on the Player Council for the whole time he's been in charge of the WTA Tour. Not only have you done that, but you've actually been proactive, telling him that you wanted to be involved in gender equality. What interests you, and why are you doing that? Do you feel responsible, or are you just interested in that stuff?
F	Did she inspire you? When she was the Fed Cup captain, did she ever talk to you about getting involved, that you were important, and that it would be good for the game?
F	You did quite well in your service games today. Was your serve feeling particularly good for you today?
F	Why is your serve so particularly good on grass?
F	We often talk about the gap between you and your sister, the next generation of Americans. A couple playing today, Vania King and Melanie Oudin. Can you talk about them, what you'd like to see them do here?
F	Would you like to see one of them step up and do something at a major?
F	Obviously you and your sister are enormously loved by the people. Do you like going out to the other courts for the doubles and see the more common fan?
F	So you prefer the stadiums?
F	Bill Clinton once went to watch Andre Agassi win the French Open. Would you like to invite your new president to come watch you at Wimbledon sometime?
F	Your sister is writing scripts in her downtime. I was wondering what you get up to in your time off? Do you have a routine in London, certain restaurants, things you like to do?
F	We have all these great kids in the room today. What is the thing you like most about our sport? If you could change one thing in the sport, what would that be?
F	How much longer do you think you're going to play?
F	Gisela Dulko told us yesterday that as well as an athlete, she is a woman, which we've noticed, by the way. Do you feel as well as athleticism and talent and dedication, there's an important place for grace and beauty and femininity in the sport?
F	You were talking about longevity. Is part of the reason why some players leave early not just because of the calendar, but they don't keep mentally refreshed? How important is it to keep you not burned out, have some other interests, not think of tennis, tennis, tennis?
F	You talked about support to your knee. This isn't about your knee, but do you think a huge part of why you're able to play at the top so long is because of your support system? Nick Bollettieri attended Serena's press conference yesterday, and he said it's because you have the most amazing parents in the world. Do you think a support system is so important?
F	Much has been made of your size, your length, your wingspan on this surface. I'm wondering if there are some advantages to being short, having shorter arms, on grass?
F	When you see other players that are small that are doing well on this surface, can you understand why that is?
M	Do you enjoy comfortable matches like that?
M	How are the courts playing? Have you noticed any difference between last year and this year?
M	No different to previous years?
M	They do change as the tournament goes on. Is that something you have to adjust to?
M	What about the speed of the courts compared to the other years?
M	The weather has been great and the roof hasn't closed yet. Do you now start to feel that maybe you would like to see how it works, the effect of it?
M	We notice today after many years Mirka wasn't in your box. Should we wait for some special announcement to be made sooner than expected, or not?
M	Is it still 10 August, more or less, the date?
M	Mirka told me.
M	Inside information.
M	A question about your Facebook account. Do you actually update everything yourself there? Was it all fun? What made you do that, your Facebook account?
M	Do you update everything yourself there?
M	What does Wimbledon mean to you?
M	There was a story in the papers this morning about yet another report of suspicious betting surrounding a tennis match, one played at Wimbledon this week. What are your views on the problem? Is this something you talk about in the locker room?
M	Is it tough to control, given the amount of players in the world game, the amount of information, flow of information about injuries to bookmakers?
M	I wonder if you had a chance to watch Andy Murray's match yesterday, and whether you were surprised that he lost a set to Robert Kendrick?
M	We haven't seen too many people that have held the No.1 ranking for a long time. Can you talk about why you think that is, and what are the challenges to regaining that ranking?
M	Very few people have held the No.1 ranking for a long period of time, not like a week or two, that have lost it and been able to regain it. Why do you think that is?
M	How about physically and mentally reaching that mountaintop, losing it, trying to get back?
M	You played in the Olympics. A late report reviewed that the air pollution level in Beijing Olympics were three times worse than in recent Olympic cities. You were playing there. Did the air quality cause you any problem at all?
M	Yes.
M	I mean the air quality instead of the weather.
M	I have the feeling you're playing with a little bit more spin this year. Am I mistaken?
M	Maybe just take us through your match. You had a bit of a shaky start, but you never looked troubled after those wobbly first couple of games.
M	The serve definitely picked up. You went sort of from losing the first serve to 13 aces.
M	How do you feel about Del Potro in the next round?
M	What is it like for you playing guys of that stature, like a Del Potro?
M	Do you really feel that's a size difference? I know you've had a problems with a Karlovic or a guy like that. Do you notice how big they are compared to you?
M	Has it ever felt a bit sort of like Land of the Giants, or you've been used to?
M	Have you had to fix your game for next time? Is there anything you picked up from this match?
M	You probably share with Nadal that at a young age you played a lot of matches, and you're both pretty labor-intensive players. With your hip and his knees, do you ascribe the five-set format in majors as contributing to injuries of that kind?
M	Nothing you'd ever think about reducing to a best-of-three format?
M	How arduous is it for you sort of getting through a Grand Slam to, say, five or eight years ago when you were on fresh legs?
M	We saw you have a little bit of a stumble the other day practicing. Is that sort of a regular thing now with the hip?
M	Just going back to the five-set thing, you've been involved in thrilling five-set matches. Do you think that the women's game could benefit from going up to a five-set format?
M	Is there still a big advantage here for people who are experienced, like yourself, on grass, to sort of a Del Potro, who is a clay courter, or has that narrowed a lot because of the conditions?
M	What's changed, the balls?
M	So the actual grass might be different?
M	You've always been a big one for representing Australia in Davis Cup. You're the only Australian here for the first time ever at Wimbledon. Is that something you're aware of? Does it sort of put any extra pressure on you?
M	No one in the change room.
M	Back to the best-of-five set question. Why doesn't that take a toll on you?
M	What do you think can be done to get more young Australian guys coming through at the top level?
M	You were just talking about how you do recover now during Grand Slams. Is that some advice you would like to give Rafa, as well? You had a lot of injuries as well. Is there something you can tell him?
M	Is it every bit as special to walk out there another year, even if you're not officially the defending champion?
M	If you had a chance to tell Rafa what he missed in terms of playing on that brand-new court, what would you tell him?
M	What about the feel of a perfect court that never has been played on before?
M	There were times during your match today when I was reminded of an essay by the late American author, David Foster Wallace. It's called, Roger Federer as Religious Experience. I'm wondering if you have heard of this essay, read it, or what you think of it?
M	Can you make some comments on Lu's game?
M	What did you think of what it looks like now with the white roof there in place? Was there any part of you that secretly thought, Maybe I'd like to see what it looks like closed?
M	Do you ever feel that you don't get as much credit as you deserve for making it as deep into tournaments as you do, not necessarily winning the tournaments, but winning these early-round matches that some might take for granted?
M	What is the mental challenge of these early-round matches for you?
M	You spoke about the difference between the Roland Garros clay court crowd and the crowd here, the difference in that feeling. Could you talk about the difference in the feeling? Are you more comfortable here in front of this crowd?
M	Since you had no grass court warmup tournament like usual, did it make today any different for you?
M	As the champion two years ago, you set an unofficial record for the length of time you graciously took all the media requests for interviews and were here late into the night. It seems like you did that at the French this past year. What makes you feel compelled to be gracious that way, to fulfill those requests to this point more than anyone else has done that?
M	Last year wasn't as much fun?
M	Last year at the finals here is what I meant.
M	Did you feel any nerves at all today coming into this tournament after the French? Is there a sense that history is behind you propelling you rather than in front of you?
M	Did you feel any nerves today different than other years?
M	How was it different than other years you came on? Is there a sense after having won the French that history is behind you?
M	When is the baby due?
M	The one thing you haven't told is when the baby is due.
M	Is it going to be this fortnight?
M	He played okay, didn't he?
M	Why has he been tough for you? Even the final in Beijing a couple years ago went three sets.
M	You have a couple more matches gone leading into Wimbledon. Is that a problem?
M	Would you like to play Eastbourne?
M	Is there any chance you'll go home to the States?
M	You said your impatience or not being impatient is the thing for the next few days.
M	Apart from practicing, what else does one do when one's impatient to go out and play a real match again? Do you do anything else but...
M	Maturation.
M	Talking about that, was it difficult not to get frustrated today, the way he was playing?
M	Can you be reassured, considering the way your championships here finished last year, you still recovered and went on to have the Wimbledon you had, is that a reassuring omen, perhaps?
M	When you've played as few matches as you have over the last two, three months, did you ever lack motivation to go out and practice?
M	Does your impatience have anything to do with the fact of how focused you are at Wimbledon and how well you feel you can do there after last year?
M	Are you just really waiting for the anticipation of it starting up once again?
M	Will you be apt to practice here, or do you think Aorangi will open up early?
M	Are you down for any XOs?
M	You said that you know how to play on grass courts. What stage in your life did you have that realization?
M	Do you remember coming up against opponents where, before you played, you warmed up, you think, I know how to do this; he doesn't?
M	Nadal was saying in here yesterday that he feels much more comfortable and natural -- the movement comes more naturally on clay and on grass, and the preponderance now of hardcourts is really hurting the game.
M	The number of hardcourt tournaments played these days, the number of matches on hardcourts, it's damaging physically.
M	Right.
M	But the general focus for anyone's body is the number of hardcourt tournaments now and the fact that we might be able to turn back the clock...
M	But it is more damaging on the body.
M	You come here every year. What is it about the tournament that's extra special for you?
M	Give us your thoughts on the match.
M	You certainly started to get better in the second set. It started to close up a little bit. It's almost like you needed another set, and you'd be perhaps...
M	You slipped a few times. Was that the surface or just the speed you were trying to play at?
M	What will you do next? What are the indications about Wimbledon?
M	You've been kind of darting around the world trying to get yourself into 250, Jamie. Give us an idea what that's been like in the last two, three weeks.
M	How close were you against Polansky?
M	4-All in the third?
M	Very close.
M	If Wimbledon doesn't happen, I mean, we have a Davis Cup tie on grass straight afterwards. Is that something that you'd like to be involved in? I mean, Leon is actually sitting there watching...
M	Why do you enjoy Davis Cup so much when you say it's the element you enjoy the most?
M	Your first Grand Slam semifinal didn't turn out like you would want, but what were your thoughts on the game generally?
M	You played three five-set matches. Did that make you a little tired?
M	What makes him such a tough opponent?
M	How do you rate his chances in the final?
M	When he played that shot to break you in the second set, was that quite demoralizing, the way the crowd seemed to get into the match more after that?
M	Did you surprise yourself making it to the semifinals here? Have you regarded yourself as someone capable of making the last four at Grand Slams?
M	By making the semifinal, you're in the top 10 now. What does that mean for the rest of the season?
M	This week everyone has been impressed by the way you played the big points. You never seem to look too worried out there. How have you learnt to be so composed at a young age?
M	I know it's so soon straight after the match, but looking ahead at other majors now, looking back at the journeys you've had here, do you think you'll become a little bit more aggressive more often, hit the ball harder earlier in the points, if you can?
M	Did you have somebody come up to you out of the stands and shake your hand?
M	What did you give him?
M	He had a Croatian jumper on.
M	Before the unfortunate ending to the match, how would you have assessed the level of your performance against him today?
M	Were you especially pleased when he broke you your response in those circumstances were to break him straight back?
M	Is it a feeling of pleasure or is the feeling a little bit hollow?
M	When he shook hands with you, you were walking to your chair. You weren't looking at him. Does that mean you weren't thinking that he might retire?
M	The break lasted nine minutes. Did they warn you it would be that long?
M	He actually broke you in the game immediately after that. How hard is it to actually stop in the middle of a Grand Slam quarterfinal, sit down for 10 minutes, have to pick it up again?
M	Cilic in the next round. You played him at the US Open. How much was the wrist a factor? How much can we read into the fact that he beat you in straight sets at the US Open?
M	Rafa said, given the way you're playing, you deserve to win this title. Do you get that feeling in you, that you're at a level that it's going to take something special to stop you?
M	Watching you practice today, you seemed very relaxed. You took three or four minutes to sign autographs. How are you staying so composed amidst all this pressure?
M	You replaced Ross with Ricky Hatton. The team looks different. Is Ricky staying round?
M	Cilic has had a lot of long matches. You haven't. Is that going to be a factor?
M	You looked really focused when you went out there today. Is there a feeling now with you that you feel like you belong in these big games at Grand Slams?
M	There were three crucial points where you decided to serve and volley for the first time in the match. What was the thought process? Why did you suddenly decide to serve and volley then? You were under pressure. Can you think what you were thinking at that time?
M	You talked about revenge on court. Does it bother you that you weren't able to produce your tennis that day and he was the guy on the other side of the net?
M	When you talk with your team after a win like tonight, do you smile more? Do you have a voice which sounds more happy than now? Now you talk almost like you lost.
M	It's very boring.
M	It appeared a very straightforward match. Was it on the court?
M	Any particular part of your game that you're happy with?
M	Would you have preferred to play a seeded player to give you more push and preparation into the quarters?
M	Australian Open is first Grand Slam of the year and of course very important to prepare well. What do you think about this so far and how important is it for you to do well in the Australian Open?
M	So like last year, you had feet problems. Did you do something particular for preparing this season?
M	You will play Almagro or Tsonga next. Can speak a little bit of those?
M	If you face Jo, what do you have to focus on especially?
M	You had a great season last year, but didn't do so well at the Grand Slams. Did it bother you to have such a wonderful season but not build on your first Grand Slam in 2008?
M	What do you mean by prioritize?
M	Does that mean shortening your schedule a little bit more?
M	You've never played him before. What kind of experience is that?
M	It's the first time you got to a Grand Slam quarterfinal without dropping a set. How do you explain your consistency?
M	You played Rafa a few years ago. Obviously, should he win, do you watch videos of recent games? Do you have a style you know can beat him?
M	Do you remember that last game well here?
M	Don't know if you've had a chance to look at your stat sheet, but 75% first serve, eight unforced errors in three sets against a guy like that. Taking all those things into account, how did you feel you played today?
M	What do you do differently when you know you have to face such a serve in order to prepare for the match?
M	Do you feel like you're finding some of your best form?
M	Can you talk us through those two backhand winners.
M	You were whirling dervish after you hit that last shot.
M	You hit that magnificent backhand, and then you were spinning like a whirling dervish.
M	Yes.
M	Have you met Prince William here?
M	Would you have liked to?
M	What sort of feedback had you had from the rapping with the Bryan brothers?
M	Can you give us a bit of a rendition of it.
M	You were talking movies with Jim Courier. Would you consider a career in film yourself?
M	You sound a bit like Sean Connery.
M	Is it a quantum leap as playing against Rafa as against the breeze that you've had in the first few rounds? In hindsight, would you have preferred to have maybe a bit more game time out there?
M	On TV they said you were more aggressive in the difficult moments of the match than you used to be before. Do you feel the same?
F	A good victory. How did you see it?
F	A lot of unforced errors early. Were you a little bit inpatient?
F	You told us at the start of the season the expectations were strong on you. You seem to have gotten over that now.
F	Assuming Serena Williams is up next. You've won the last couple time you've met. What do you think about that?
F	Anything you need to do specifically better to beat her?
F	What is the mindset in that game? Is it sort of low expectations because she's world No.1, defending champion, or high expectations because you have the support of the crowd?
F	I imagine your coach told you to stay focused at all times of the game. What did he have to say?
F	The fans are pretty vocal. Does that help you more, or do you feel bad if you don't live up to the expectations?
F	After your win in L.A., Serena called you a good framer. What was that all about?
F	You didn't see it as a lucky win?
F	How do you feel about the match?
F	Have you had a quicker Grand Slam match than that? It was 57 minutes.
F	Elena said she was overpowered. Is that basically what the game was all about?
F	You looked really relaxed out there. What did you do on your day off?
F	Did you see the movie?
F	Did you watch any tennis?
F	Are you a good cook?
F	What is your signature dish?
F	Today's match, what would you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10? Improvement from the first couple of matches?
F	When you walk into a bookstore in Melbourne, do a lot of people recognize you? Do you like that?
F	What did you think of Elena's game?
F	Is it your serve that's the problem with your game?
F	Seems like it's been the same story: you fight, try to improve, and you get in these matches and you're falling a little bit short.
F	What part of the actual serve are you trying to change or improve on?
F	In some of the key moments, it seems like you're lacking confidence.
F	If someone asked you about your game in 2008 and 2010, what would you say? Why were you No.1 and playing French Open final, and now second round out?
F	Why were you lacking fitness last year?
F	When you took three months off at the end of last year, how did you spend that time?
F	You say that was part of sport, recapturing glory when everything is going well, and you're challenged by form and fitness.
F	Have you spoken to Adam about that? You both had similar years that just escaped you at times.
F	What do you do this year to give yourself a break when you're away from tennis? How do you unwind and relax? Is there something different in your routine this year?
F	Are you able to play from instinct, or are you thinking too much on court?
F	You said the ball toss is a problem for you. What is the difficulty for you?
F	You talked about playing with instinct. When was the last time you think you were playing with pure instinct and not thinking?
F	Is it still fun, or are there days when it's stressful and you feel like you're suffering?
F	What do you make of your performance today out there?
F	So what do you think you need to improve moving forward?
F	Do you know anything about your next opponent?
F	What sort of match do you expect?
F	How have you spent the off-season?
M	How did you feel today?
M	Do you feel you will be successful like 2008?
M	I don't think we know yet who you play next, do we?
M	Do you have a preference on either?
M	Why?
M	So you're hoping for an easy match for round two?
F	Slight difficulty closing it out. Must have been a thrill when you did.
F	Is this even sweeter after the year you've had?
F	First memories of Daniel a straight sets loss. We could see you were in pain when you were serving. How far do you feel you've come in the year physically and mentally?
F	Since last year, what changes have you made to your game?
F	Did you have a short-term goal for the Australian Open and a longer term goal for the year?
F	I think 2008 was the only other time you didn't get past the first round. This must be like a mini achievement.
F	It was a total reconstruction of the shoulder?
F	Are there times that you questioned whether you could get back and serve at full pace?
F	What were you enjoy doing as a normal person, as you say?
F	But the fire was still in the belly?
F	Your next opponent, a German.
F	It's Barrois.
F	Sorry. I just finished writing about her.
F	Is Target still on board?
F	Is Pratty still helping you?
M	What are your thoughts after the game?
M	What were your thoughts maybe through the first set, because it didn't look like it was all going to be as easy as you thought it might have been.
M	Did you step it up in that tiebreak? Did you find something in that tiebreak and go on with it from there?
M	What is the difference, when you say you started to play longer, more aggressive? Is it just confidence and getting more belief in the second and third sets?
M	How was the crowd?
M	Were you having some problems with your shoes or the grip on the court sometimes?
M	A bit old, were they, the shoes?
M	And the fingers?
M	Are you in favor of this World Cup of tennis that people are talking about?
M	You seem a bit slimmer than last year, a bit lighter.
M	After the match, Jim Courier was asking you about last year, reflecting on the semifinal, the final. Coming back to Melbourne, have you been thinking about that a lot?
M	Is it an advantage having the feature match at night now being the earlier match? You know when your starting time is going to be.
M	If you could give us your thoughts.
M	As disappointing as it is, can you take great pride right now in the way you performed?
M	It was exciting for us to watch it. How exciting was it to actually be involved in something like that?
M	Have you ever played better and lost?
M	You are losing these excellent contests against Rafa. Are you doing anything special when you play against him? Any specific things you're trying to implement?
M	How mental does it get when a match is over three hours is decided in a tiebreak over a couple of points?
M	In your opinion, which was the key situation or key points where the match was turning against you?
M	Talking about the tiebreakers. The first tiebreak you didn't put one first serve in the last five points when you served. You served very well until that moment. Were you more nervous at that point?
M	In the last tiebreaker, you were up 3-Love with two mini breaks. There is one single point that you remember that you think you should have played differently, that you regret the way you played?
M	What goes through your mind before you play such big points in a tiebreak?
M	Has he ever served that much to your forehand before?
M	Do you think Rafael Nadal is the only player who could beat you today playing like this?
M	Which are your thoughts on Rafa in the on-court interview said that the British crowd shouldn't be putting all the pressure on you to win a Grand Slam?
M	You've played both Rafa and Roger this tournament. How do you rate the way they've been playing, in your opinion?
M	Rafa normally is the latest one going to the coin draw at the beginning of the match. He makes everybody wait for him. Not today. You sat down on your chair for a long time. Did you challenge him to do that, to go first, or it was just one of those things?
M	This year no problem with three victories for the semis.
M	Obviously winning this event in itself is a big thing. Is there also a sense with you that you want to put down a marker as well in terms of next year to show that you're going to be right in there sort of breathing down Rafa's neck?
M	Your thoughts about meeting Maradona? We know he requested specifically to come to London to meet you. What did you say?
M	We heard last year you didn't win Swiss sports personality, year after becoming the greatest champion of all time. What are your chances of winning it this year?
M	Why is that?
M	You talked at the last match about the grit you show at the end of the year. Your record in this championship sums that up. In terms of matches you played, this one today was almost faultless. Could you possibly have played much better than you played today?
M	Starting from Toronto, now you're making at least the semifinals for eight tournaments in a row. Can you share with us some thoughts why your level is obviously more stable in the second half of the season than the first half the season?
M	I'd like to know what is your feeling once you won the first set? You know you qualified, you're number one in your group. How do you play after, more relaxed or afraid to lose concentration, or if there is a ball far away, you let it go or don't think about it?
M	Over the years you've had many different coaches at different stages of your life. What for you makes a good coach?
M	In terms of psychological learning, do you think this season was a bit different for you, where you had to deal with some harsh realities like, Perhaps I am not as ahead of the other guys as I thought, something like that?
M	Just on the last point of the first set. Robin thought it might have been a bit of a miss-hit. Was it?
M	Your backhand that he left.
M	You were down a set and a break. Did you change anything to be able to come back?
M	You said that you started very nervous. But you caught a rhythm at the end. What do you expect for the next match? Djokovic is in good form.
M	Andy mentioned two points in the tiebreaker in particular that he thought the match turned on. One of them was a serve that you got back in play. Do you have recollection of that? Do you think in terms of specific points like that?
M	The one point in particular.
M	In the tiebreaker.
M	You just spoke about the fact that you hadn't won a match over here. Was that on your mind when you went out to play, that you hadn't won a set or match at the tournament here in London?
M	Do you think going a set behind, a break behind allowed you to relax and play better tennis, or was it that you spent more time on the court, or was it your nerves?
M	Rafael, when you're playing the match like today, Roddick was a set up, a break up, are you thinking, I can lose, or you go point by point?
M	You just came back from injuries. How do you live this period when you have to stop playing in competition? Do you live it better now with experience or is it always very hard to be just out?
M	Can you just give us your general thoughts about how the match went and what was the turning points, you thought?
M	Ljubicic said you have a game similar to Roddick. What was the difference today?
M	How did you feel after the second set? You said it was a struggle most of the day, but...
M	Were you surprised that Nadal lost against Ljubicic?
M	You've played Andy a couple times before. How do you think he's changed as a player since you last played him? Do you think he's better?
M	You came up a little bit short in the end, but you had a great kind of run. Do you like playing at this event?
M	You've had a good year. Are you happy with your success this year so far and the end of last year?
M	Do you have any thoughts about the finals with Andy taking on Ivan?
M	Obviously you had your great wins and your great runs. Roland Garros is still a couple months away. In the back of your mind, are you thinking about the French at all? Are you anticipating your time there?
M	You know, you were talking about you didn't feel like you were playing well, but I don't think Andy got broken until he played you today. Can you talk a little bit about what you did against Andy's serve to have success? I think you broke him like three times.
M	Into the last four. Nice early birthday present for you?
M	What is it about here, this place and this surface and this atmosphere, that you obviously like?
M	So you're going to move to California, then, huh?
M	Was your match on TV in Croatia?
M	Did you feel you were playing well in the first set?
M	Do you have to be playing well to be playing creative, that kind of creative tennis?
M	Overall, did you have a better feel for your game today than against Novak?
M	So it must be nice to reach a semifinals; it's been a little while, huh?
M	Do you feel 31, or do you feel older or younger?
M	What did you change?
M	Some guys your age will do less practice when they get into their 30s.
M	Does it make it any easier at the ripe old age of 31 to continue with the training, or is it just the same as...
M	Can you talk a little bit about each of the possible semifinal opponents and what you think would be the key in either match?
M	You will watch it?
M	The way you're talking about the mental, the physical aspects, how you're feeling in your game, is this possibly as good as you've felt all around in your career?
M	You said you were feeling creative today. Why today? Do you always feel that way, or was there a reason today?
M	You're good friends with Roger, so how difficult was it to have the friendship grow when he was the guy, during your top years, stopping you time and time again?
M	How difficult is to keep up the friendship when the one guy that is stopping you...
M	Can it sometimes be tricky playing a player you haven't played before?
M	Is that just a nice one to get under your belt? Get in straight sets?
M	What happened when you ran into the net?
M	Did you hurt yourself in any way?
M	You've had your share of injuries at a young age, so has Rafa. Do you attribute that to his style of play or your style of play or just the rigors of the tour? Maybe a little bit of both?
M	In the case of Rafa, who has had, you know, some extended time off, do you attribute it to his physical style of play or...
M	I'd like to ask a little bit different question. We in the media are always judging all of the players. I'd like to sort of switch the cards or switch the picture. What are your gut feelings? What are your thoughts in general on the job that the media does overall in terms of the big picture?
M	Yeah, telling the story of tennis, promoting it, it being fair or not so fair.
M	And last week, Andy Roddick on the one hand complained that maybe the coverage of tennis in the United States is not that great, but maybe it wasn't so good to have reporting where they say at 4:15 you took a gulp of Gatorade. Do you think that sometimes there's too much in any way, or in your case, or not?
M	When you're playing a match, is it a positive experience, a match like the one today? Are you enjoying it? Is it sort of more neutral, this is what I have to do, or are you thinking, boy, I wish I didn't have to do this?
F	Frustrating time for you today?
F	It seemed towards the end of the second set you had begun to feel your range. Did you feel that, or no?
F	When you say you didn't do what you had to do, is that to play more aggressively, or what should you have done that you didn't do?
F	You still have nerves?
F	But at the end I think you tossed your racquet once. Were you just frustrated?
F	You get mad at the ball, or do you get mad at yourself?
F	Are your nerves more a problem when you are No.1 seed than when you aren't?
F	I'd like to ask you sort of a general question. You've been on tour for many, many years. What are your thoughts about us, about the media? What are the things you really like, you don't like, and do you think we do a good job or maybe not?
F	She played 10 feet behind the baseline, and you volley so well. I was wondering, it was obvious that you were not feeling the ball well today. I thought you might be able to intimidate her a little bit more by coming to the net.
F	What was the reason for your stepping? Were you trying to loosen the strings?
F	You come from a fantastic Russian sports family. What the heck happened in Vancouver to the Russian team, do you think?
F	So is it good that in tennis there are not style points like in figure skating? Is that good that you're not judged on your...
F	Did you watch the Hit for Haiti last night?
F	The Hit for Haiti exhibition, did you watch it?
F	How would you sum that up?
F	We have to ask you about the leg, the left knee.
F	Is it just a ligament problem or strain? Is it an impact joint in general terms?
F	How are you feeling going into next week now?
F	Has the injury of the leg caused any pain in the previous matches?
F	That was my next question: Are you gonna play doubles in Melbourne, or would you still preserve the body for singles?
F	Both days, very slow start. Down Love-5 in each match. What was causing that, do you think?
F	Speaking to your coach after the match, what did he have to say to you?
F	Even though you lost the match, I imagine it's very good preparation because you did play some high-quality tennis in the second set.
F	When it started to rain to the second set, you seemed a bit concerned about the courts.
F	Do you feel they should have carried the game over to tomorrow?
F	D you feel look I played enough good tennis today to give you some confidence to take into next week?
M	First title in nearly one year. How big a relief is it?
M	You looked a little nervous when you had to serve at 4-1 in the second set. Were you nervous?
M	You said last year you did not play well. This year you've lost only 14 games in the whole tournament. What does that mean for you? There is such a huge difference between you and all the others, or not, when you play at your best?
M	Do you think you're back to your best level now?
M	Can you explain what are the keys to be successful on clay? What do you concentrate on? Is it the movement of the feet? Is it the forehand?
M	Is this the best final you have played since when you played and beat very easily Federer at Roland Garros, that you really destroyed him?
M	You say the scores here are a little bit unreal. Who do you expect to be your toughest opponents on this surface?
M	Last year you won here, you won in Barcelona, in Rome, final in Madrid. When you arrived in Paris, you were tired and a little hurt. Now that you have won here, could you change your schedule or do you intend to play all the clay court tournaments like last year?
M	You looked very emotional on the court. What was going through your mind at that moment?
M	You often talk about the crowd, how much the crowd helps you here. Could you talk about how special the crowd is for you here.
M	The memory of this tournament is very fresh, of course. But out of the six Monte-Carlo tournaments, is there one that sticks more than the others for you? The first because it was the first, or others?
M	When you beat Federer, there is more...
M	When you play, you know every inch of the court. Everywhere in the world that you play, do you feel you know every inch of that court?
M	Can you talk us through that. What was going through your mind out there?
M	You missed a lot of first serves. Does that spread out to the rest of the game?
M	You said you felt nerves coming back before the game. Any particular reason?
M	Do you think you are thinking too much or you are not thinking enough on court?
M	How many days of practice did you have on clay? Were you hitting the ball well in practice?
M	Anything about the way he played that made it a bit tougher today?
M	Could you compare the moment you are living now, this result, with another moment of your career?
M	Does this change possibly your clay schedule?
M	So what about this match?
M	Is it harder to play on clay court? At one point it was a big problem.
M	How long did you train? A week?
M	Did you have a physical problem?
M	But now everything is okay?
M	Are you as happy to play on hard court as you are on claycourt?
M	The next one will be a real test.
F	Is it meaningful to clinch the US Open Series? Does it say you're playing well or is it nice to have that bonus money waiting there?
F	Are you glad to have the day off or would you prefer to get another match?
F	Last year you spoke about applying to Yale. What happened with that?
F	On an online basis, obviously?
F	Why does that interest you?
F	Do you have classes or courses in mind that interest you?
F	Just to figure out what you're going to do with all your career earnings?
F	Can you talk about how much you've improved your game the last couple years, what areas you think you've really made major steps in.
F	This being one of them?
F	Any thoughts on tomorrow night's match against Elena?
F	Have you looked at your US Open draw yet?
F	Never look at it?
F	Is there anything you consider your strength right now when you're on the court?
F	Can you address the off-court aspect of glamour in women's tennis, the importance of that, how much you enjoy that side of it.
F	I think it was this time last year that the Stella McCartney aspect came up.
F	At that time you were saying you didn't have that much involvement; you hadn't met her at that stage. Have things taken a step forward with that?
F	Is it important to be both feminine and a great athlete?
M	Pleased with that?
M	Was the best part of that the fact you really sat on him when you got a significant advantage, kept him down?
M	Movement as you wanted it?
M	What does this do for your confidence, seeing that you beat a guy that's been on such a hot streak and someone you never beat before?
M	Were you surprised at just how easy you made it look?
M	Do you think about the ranking situation at the moment, that you may drop down to No.5 if you don't get to the final? Does that fit into your thinking at all?
M	I read today that for the 2012 Olympics at Wimbledon they're going to not enforce the all-white rule. For somebody who is from that neck of the woods and plays at Wimbledon, what's your opinion on that? Should they be wearing all whites during the Olympics at the All England Club?
M	What are your thoughts on that as a beginning of your defense of your title?
M	You turned it around actually very quickly, didn't you? You played that terrific game to break back, and it seemed to alter the whole feeling of the match.
M	Playing a very good game, that one at 4-5, I mean, do you sort of think about trying to do that beforehand or does it happen? How did it come about?
M	When was the last time that you feel you could turn a match around just quite so quickly as that?
M	After this win, what is your confidence level going into the third round of play?
M	Just a question about Nadal. You played him a lot of times. What are the two or three biggest differences between playing him on clay and playing him on hardcourts?
M	You said you could be a bit better. You said you felt good. Was there anything in your game today that you felt you need to improve for the rest of the tournament with such a strong field in front of you?
M	What is it that influences whether you move well or not?
M	In the context of the match, how important do you think was the moment when your string popped and you were able to obviously win that point?
M	As a week, is this what you were expecting or has it come as something of a surprise after the way things have been the last few weeks, illness and whatnot?
M	I know you don't like to put percentages on your fitness, but how did you feel in the match against Ljubicic compared to how you felt out there tonight?
M	To digress from the match. You've been here now for a week. I'm curious if you know now why this event was voted the top event on the 1000 level by the players last year? As far as the amenities, the way they treat you, is there a noticeable difference here from other events?
M	We'll find out in a few hours, but any preference for tomorrow, Novak or Roger?
M	Back to the Australian Open earlier this year, the final. What did you learn from that and how have you improved as a player since that match?
M	You mentioned Toronto. Roger said this surface here in Shanghai is similar to Toronto and the situation is almost the same. You're in the final now. You're waiting for the winner of either Djokovic or Roger. Would you find any relevance to that tournament and does it help you to know you won Toronto?
M	You gave a pretty good rundown if it is Roger. If it's Novak, the head-to-head is pretty definitive in that he won the first four and you've won the most recent three. That kind of suggests that he had your number early on and you worked out how to play him. Is that a fair comment?
M	You said aggression is important against Roger and Rafa. Is that same aggression necessary against Novak or do you play him a different way?
M	Do you have some comment on this match? What is the key to your success?
M	You have played him three times and never got a set. What was different this time?
M	The first set was 6-1. Did you think it would be that easy against him? Did you sense he was vulnerable in any way in the first set?
M	Now the way to the semifinals seems open. You play Monaco. It was unexpected to play such a ranked player.
M	How does this win make you more confident you can qualify for London in the singles? If you qualify in both singles and doubles, have you imagined how busy you would have to be in London?
M	Was it the French Open this year that you met Nadal in the semis?
M	With this win today, does that give you a little redemption for that loss in Paris?
M	Could you tell us your feelings at that moment when you realized you defeated the world No.1?
M	Your first round you beat the Taipei player. What do you think of his performance? And what's the meaning of your ring?
M	Your opponent played three tournaments in a row. Do you feel maybe he's a little physically tired or not as quick?
M	Could you comment on the game today.
M	Yesterday you said that today is also a good opportunity to learn from highly ranked players. What did you learn? What is the biggest gap between you and Andy?
M	This is the first time that you played on center court. You said yesterday you felt a little dizzy. Were you feeling dizzy today?
M	What's the difference between playing with Andy and yesterday playing with Radek? What's the difference between these two players which led to the different performances today?
M	He had 80% first serves. You had only 50%. Is this the biggest gap technically?
M	Both you and Andy are tall and thin. You said there is also a gap between you and Andy in physical conditioning. He exercised a lot over the past several years to increase muscles. Do you also have that plan?
M	You said yesterday your game today would be a good learning opportunity. What have you learned and what does your performance over the last two days say about male tennis as it gets better?
M	I didn't see the technical parameters afterwards. I think in today's match in terms of the place that the ball hits the ground, in terms of the speed of the ball, you're not as inferior.
M	Other Chinese players think they don't have a big gap between themselves and the top players in the world, but you think you have a lot of gaps with those top players.
M	Your ranking is 465, but you had a win yesterday. How high will your ranking be? Next year what ranking do you want to have?
M	You talked about your game. Andy is regarded as the master of tactics. After today's match, did you think you have learned something from Andy?
M	What do you think needs to be changed in the development process for players to make that extra leap?
M	Is this one of those matches where you look at a lot of hard work over a lot of years and this is the payoff?
M	How much did you decide to change your approach with the way the match was going when you got into the match a little bit?
M	When did you become desperate, exactly?
M	How confident are you in the third set? You get your nose down in front of the break, and it seemed like you almost coasted on his serve. To have that 135 in the pocket, how effective was it?
M	In the eighth game of the second set when you broke at Love and you were ripping and/or taking some nice cuts on your forehand, what's prevented you in the past in some big matches from doing that in those matches and doing it today.
M	How often in the past have you served and volleyed on the second serve and been that effective as well? You've got to be proud about that.
M	What's it like charging forward against Rafa?
M	In every year there are certain boosts to your morale or a player's morale. Where does this one rank in terms of morale boosters?
M	You were talking on TV about how you felt after Memphis with your shoulder and knee and stuff. Did you think going into the next two tournaments it might be kind of tough for you? How pleased are you that it didn't turn out that way?
M	Andy, Soderling? Berdych?
M	How about emotionally? I mean, a match like this, it really almost felt like a final out there. The crowd and it's Rafa and all that. How did you keep that level of intensity for Sunday?
M	You just said something really interesting...
M	I thought as professional athletes you always expect to win. Coming into this tournament you really didn't see yourself as getting into the...
M	How would you say Rafa responded to your tactics? Did you feel like he fell off at the last two sets, or was he right there?
M	How do you feel about upcoming clay season?
M	What was the immediate thought or feeling right when you won the match? What did you think or feel?
M	Are you looking forward to participate tomorrow in the charity event for Chile?
M	Just when things were going great.
M	Can't get a break.
M	How long do you think it'll keep you out?
M	Have you had sciatica or anything in the past? Nothing?
M	The pain, was it the in the hip? The back?
M	From here down...
M	And what exactly was the motion you were doing when you fell down? Describe the fall.
M	I hate it pound this, but this is your best tournament here; you're playing as good as you've played in a long time; feeling great. What do you have to do to like...
M	Were you especially fired up here because of the makeover and this being more or less your home tournament?
M	You've talked about the diet and the hard work you put in. But having done this makeover for yourself, is it also like more fun? Are you happy to get out there and practice and win matches?
M	Were you envious when you would see these other guys really fit? Did you somewhere inside you say, I should do that?
M	What kept you from doing it?
M	At this point, do you pull for your old roomy, Roddick?
M	One last one on Andy. Seems the last few years he's just figured it out. He used to be more of a power guy. What do you see as the biggest change?
F	I read somewhere that you had a couple weeks off before the beginning of the tournament. How long does it take before your rust totally disappears?
F	As of yesterday you were the only American woman left in the draw. It's been happening more and more often. Does it concern you that when you and Serena finally walk into the sunset there will not be an American Grand Slam champion for years to come?
F	Do you see any light at the end of the of the tunnel?
F	Look like you were struggling with your serve. Was it the wind or something else?
F	Do you prefer playing a tournament when Serena is playing, or doesn't matter anymore?
F	16 trips to the net today. Always love to see you come to the net.
F	We've heard you say that before. Is there still reluctance at times to come to the net? Where does that fit into your game at this point in your career?
F	Do you like it when you're up there? When you you're up there, you like your chances?
F	Besides your ability, is it a way of -- I mean, you've had injuries. You're getting older. Is there a way to speed up the game to take charge faster?
F	What kind of feedback did you get on the dress?
F	So the reviews have been favorable?
F	How do you just describe it?
F	During your match, Dwyane Wade and Andy Roddick were playing HORSE on the court, and tennis. Trust me, Andy looks a lot better playing basketball than D-Wade looked playing tennis. I know you are a D-Wade. You go to Heat games. Would you have liked to be part of that?
F	Andy had him down 3-1 in HORSE.
F	Sandbagging, you think?
F	He beat him with a shot from the floor. He went on the floor and banked it in.
F	You've won when you've had long breaks and won when you've played a lot. When you're on a winning streak like this, does it do anything in terms of your confidence or your level or anything at all? You know, the impact, does it impact just the way you're playing?
F	Where do you stand in terms of Fed Cup? Have you pretty much closed the door on that? Left it open?
F	I don't know. You haven't played in a while.
F	So are we going to see you in Birmingham?
F	Have you told Mary Joe you'd like to be a part?
F	And she was receptive?
F	But if she came to you and said, I want you to play in Birmingham, you're available?
F	It looked like you framed a second serve. I'm just wondering -- everybody is human, of course. You almost laugh out loud. Do you roll your eyes, or what is the reaction?
F	So what happened there?
F	It just shows how hard tennis is.
F	Nice match today.
F	How do you feel in where you're at right now in your game? Obviously you've tripped up a little bit in the last, you know, six, seven, eight months. How are you feeling now? You feel like it's evening out, coming back?
F	Heinz Gunthardt?
F	Great coach. When you look back a little bit, do you feel like it was a little bit too much too soon and it kind of overwhelmed you, either on the court or off the court?
F	Who do you feel was pushing you so hard? Was that you, your parents, your coach? Who was pushing you so hard?
F	A lot of other girls were in similar boat as you. Jelena Jankovic had trouble after she reached No.1; Maria Sharapova to a certain extent. That was more injury-related, but Jankovic also said she trained too hard. Jankovic is coming back. Do you see her win at Indian Wells last week as kind of a good thing for you to see?
F	Last question for the new me: Your goals. I mean, once you reach No.1, is it automatic, I have to be No.1 again, or do you have other goals?
F	Could you talk about the backhand topspin lob and your decision to hit that shot there?
F	Were you thinking about the wind on that shot? Were you thinking it might sit up in the wind a little bit?
F	It was such a roller coaster. You're up 5-2 in the second, and then she storms back; 4-2 in the third, and she storms back. What's going through your head as...
F	You were up in the second, right, when she came back?
F	5-3. I will check my notes.
F	You were up a break. You were up 5-2.
F	So I guess you were thinking...
F	Can you remember a more challenging Grand Slam in terms of conditions, wind?
F	How hard is it to fine tune your game every two games? You cross the net and you have to make fine changes in what you do with the ball.
F	Takes away the instinct from a player. You can't just react. You have to factor in what you've already made your mind up, the way the wind is blowing, think about it.
F	How do you feel to be in the finals again? What does it mean that you had to get through Venus Williams?
F	Last year your run here was unexpected and incredibly sweet. What is it this year?
F	What are your memories from your first match against her back in '01, and how different of a player are you?
F	Against Venus.
F	You were taped up, I remember.
F	You have such a great record at night here. You talked earlier in the week about it being a different atmosphere. But how do those differences play into your game, your personality, or whatever?
F	Did you feel tired in the third set at all?
F	Compared to when you retired, do you have perspective? You have a child now; you have a daughter. Do you care or do you care more that you're competing for this title? Does winning mean as much as before or less?
F	Were you surprised about how much support you got out there? You're playing an American. Seems to me like you got about 50% of the support.
F	What are you expecting from Vera tomorrow?
F	You said that the wind was a problem. Was the temperature also an issue for you?
F	You said on TV there's so many players that can win the tournament. Do you really believe that or do you think there's three or four strong favorites?
F	But if it's unpredictable, are you surprised you've reached the quarterfinals?
F	What about Kaia Kanepi? What will you have to do?
F	If I recall correctly, a tough injury in Charleston, a run at Wimbledon, then here. Are you thrilled by this? Are you a little surprised by it? Is it the result of a lot of hard work?
F	At what point can you, as a player that's been around for a while, sense that a young player with potential, like Wozniacki, can actually come to a Grand Slam, not get nervous and beat a player like Sharapova? Sometimes young players play a veteran player and they can't handle it emotionally.
F	A lot of tennis, many people say, is about belief, inner feeling. Can you imagine yourself lifting the trophy a week from Saturday as the winner?
F	Has your schoolwork in any way helped you as a tennis player?
F	Are your studies on hold now?
F	Can you do any of that online, or is it all in person?
F	The courses you're taking?
F	Which ones are you taking now?
F	You said after Wimbledon that you felt like you rushed too much mentally in the final. Is that something you're going to try to be careful about here, not to rush through your games?
F	How do you prepare each match and with who?
F	No tactical?
M	You feel like you're getting better with every match?
M	Do you think after your performance today it's time for everyone to start taking you more seriously as a contender this year?
M	Would you say it's the best you've been playing in Grand Slam this year?
M	Do you think you have an advantage in that Rafa and Federer have so much attention and you can sort of play under the radar a little even though you're the No.3 seed?
M	I want to ask you about Davis Cup. You played quite impressive here, while the Czechs went out in the first round. Is it important for the matchup in Belgrade next week?
M	Do you think that the exhaustion can be important, because the Czechs are out and Radek Stepanek may be preparing while you are here?
M	When we think back three years ago when you were the sensational finalist and the joker on the court, don't get me wrong, but it seemed easy came for you, a, of things. Is that right, or maybe a wrong...
M	How do you feel about the problem coughing and lose the breath?
M	So you described how there was no pressure then. What's the pressure like now, and how are you dealing with it?
M	Next one you will be facing will be Gal Monfils. You beat him the last four times you played, but the matches were pretty close. What made the difference between you two in these matches?
M	Do you feel you're the best you've ever been right now?
M	Do you think you enjoy yourself more than some of the other top players? You seem to joke around a lot.
M	Are you a better player now, do you think, than when you won the Australian?
M	When you think about Roger and Rafa and their head-to-heads, Rafa has the big advantage. In your mind, why do you think Nadal has such a big lead in their matches against one another?
M	Are you feeling better about this place? You haven't done really too well here.
M	Oh, yeas. That's not bad.
M	I'm writing a book on Marcelo Rios. Do you have any memory? Talk about him a little bit.
M	What about the way he played.
M	The improvements we're seeing in your serve, is this a result of a change in your technique or your motion, or is it more a matter of confidence and attitude?
M	You haven't had a five-set match here yet, but you are 14-3 in fifth sets. Why do you think you're so good in them?
M	Do you like best-of-five over best-of-three?
M	Pete Sampras always said that Andre Agassi raised the level of his game and made him a better player. Do you feel that way a little bit about Roger, too? Does he raise your game more than any of the other players?
M	How much do you think about the importance of adding this slam to your rsum? How much do you think about that?
M	What parts of Roger's game has he improved over the past few years? What parts of your game have you improved?
M	It's harder to take advantage of his backhand now?
M	Simon said he was pretty anxious to get back to France to see his newborn son. Could you tell that he mentally checked out in the third set because he wanted to leave? What did you say to him at the net in the end?
M	There was a report this afternoon that the other day you didn't want to take one of the transportation vans that had a picture of Roger. Can you describe what happened?
M	Did you get out of that car that had his picture or you stayed in it?
M	Did you say you thought Davis Cup should be reduced to best-of-three?
M	So far four Spanish people made it into the next round. Tommy still has a chance. Looks a little bit like Spanish Open.
M	Why is this court the most difficult for you personally, and how have you begun to overcome that?
M	So how confident are you at this point with that ball on this surface without having a US Open championship before?
M	You told Mary Joe in the prematch interview you might have to adjust your match for the wind. Did you have to adjust your game? How brutal was the wind?
M	How would you compare your class to win the French Open and complete a career slam with Rafa's pursuit of the US Open and a career slam?
M	Last night Rafa said that in his mind you're the best player in history. If he is able to complete the career slam, given his head-to-head with you, how young he is, what are your thoughts on his chances to eventually be the best player in history?
M	How much better a player are you because Rafa has been such a rival for you? What are the two or three things specifically you've worked in your game to try and deal with Rafa?
M	But he has made you a better player?
M	What do you think separates players who are successful in fifth sets from those who aren't?
M	4-13.
M	Changing subjects. As you are a great fan of soccer, I would like to ask you about your thoughts about the last World Cup, and specifically if you saw any games of Uruguay and have you ever met Diego Forlan?
M	You might play Ferrero in the next round. How much do you think you influenced his career in the sense when you guys are from the same generation, he used to be a No.1, then he started losing lots of matches, not fighting for the big titles. How much do you think you affected him?
M	Those conditions, how successful could you be hitting high, loopy, soft balls?
M	I wanted to ask you what you think of the new, slimmer Mardy Fish? Still remains to be seen how he'll do here. He says he feels like a completely different player now.
M	Did you see Francesca Schiavone's shot between the legs?
M	Is it more difficult for a girl, in your opinion, to do it?
M	That seemed to go pretty much as well as you could have hoped.
M	He stuck with you in the beginning, but you really began to pull away. Did you find something in his game and exploit it or did you find something in your own game today?
M	Did you always get the sense it was just a question of him blowing himself out and it would be your opportunity to take control of the match?
M	I think 90% points won on your first serve, of which you got 59% in. Do statistics like that please you?
M	Is it a bit unnerving when you're playing someone who suddenly becomes a crowd favorite?
M	Have you ever played anyone before that never sits down at the changeover, marches out to play about 30 seconds before he has to? Does that unsettle you at all?
M	Did you talk to him at all?
M	Can you talk a little bit about his serve. Seemed like it surprised you, his first two attempts. Took you some time to read it.
M	I know you've done it before, but you went out, had a half hour or more on the practice court. Is that because you didn't think you had enough time on court?
M	Is there any truth in the rumor that he would like to play for Great Britain or the LTA are courting him?
M	It's looking very much like Wawrinka in the next round. Can you speak about your record with him, what kind of test he's going to pose.
M	It's a 5-3 record. You won five of the last six. Does that tell us anything?
M	If Rafa were to win here and complete the career slam, how do you think that will change the way his record is looked at, his career is looked at, in comparison with Roger's?
M	What are your thoughts on the speed of this court versus the speed at Wimbledon and how that affects Rafa's game?
M	Did you get caught up watching the near hysteria of the hurricane coming on the news programs this morning?
M	You beat Wawrinka in straight sets in 2008 on your way to the final here. Thinking back, can you remember what you did particularly well that day to win quite comfortably?
M	Does he have any sort of real weapons or it more of his sort of all-around solid game?
M	If the fans from Murray Mount or Henman Hill were suddenly transposed and brought here to Ashe Stadium, how do you think they'd handle the New York fans? Do you think they'd stand up?
M	Would they be just as enthusiastic and fit into the hysteria?
M	Do you think there will ever be a fight break out at Wimbledon like there was during the Djokovic match last night?
M	How are you feeling after that and what has happened to you in the locker room since coming off the court?
M	You haven't been on an IV or anything like that?
M	Your thoughts about what you were able to do today, persevere in that heat and beat Cilic?
M	You've had bad luck with injuries over the past year or two.
M	The fact that you are able to get through a match like that under such difficult conditions, can you look at that as maybe something that can give you confidence going forward, that you're able to persevere, win a tournament under those conditions?
M	I know you got asked about it courtside, but it's 15 years since Matsuoka had an infamous match out there when he was in agony with cramps. You were a young kid when that happened. You obviously know Shuzo. Have you talked to him about that experience?
M	You said you started cramping in the second set, which is early.
M	When you got into a fifth, were you afraid that something really unpleasant might happen?
M	So does this give you more satisfaction than anything you've achieved in tennis so far, coming through that match, coming through five hours in that heat?
M	I was going to ask you to compare it to the Ferrer match in 2008. Would you rate this higher than that?
M	Would you say this was the most satisfying match between the two?
M	How big a sports star are you in Japan?
M	Do you enjoy it? Do you enjoy being famous?
M	Is it very nice to finally be allowed to start this tournament Wednesday?
M	Because it obviously means you have a play - to win this title - seven in 12 days. Is that fair?
M	How do you feel to have your first-round match under your belt?
M	Is it just about sort of getting off the court as quickly as possible when it's that hot out there?
M	People have been falling over, and Ljubicic has been complaining about how difficult it is. Obviously Cincy a couple weeks it was hotter than this.
M	Is this tougher here than Australia because it's more humid?
M	This is the benefit of the hard Miami training coming out here. Can you just talk us through what precautions and preliminaries you do to deal with it? Obviously you take in a lot of fluids.
M	Does that become an issue? Because if you put a lot of that stuff on, you sweat and then you become a bit of a mess.
M	Well, the sweat coming through the sunblock. My experiences on holiday.
M	What do you know of Dustin Brown? Have you seen much of him?
M	How would you describe what this hardcourt season did for your level of confidence entering this tournament?
M	Would you say that your level of confidence, because of what occurred in this hardcourt season, is the highest it's ever been?
M	So basically you say you feel good, feel confident. Are you saying you're confident enough this tournament will give you a win? Give us an insight on how you perceive the tournament. You have Rafa and you have Federer. You say you feel confident. Do you think you feel confident enough that the game can take you over the top?
M	Does that mean you're very impressed by the level of talent you see here so far?
M	To have beaten Rafa and Roger in the same tournament, does that have any special significance to you, to beat them in the same tournament?
M	In terms of the speed of the court and the balls, how does this compare with Toronto and Cincinnati?
M	Do you prefer that?
M	Going back to Dustin Brown, when you don't know too much about a player, how much do you try to find out, or do you just rely on getting out there and working it out for yourself?
M	Did you have a chance to see Roger's shot between his legs the other night for a winner?
M	What were your thoughts about that and how he's able to come up with these shots?
M	Why do you think the one against Djokovic was better?
M	Is that something that you work on at all?
M	How do you do?
M	Would you try it in a match?
M	Novak said he'd be more concerned about damaging himself with a racquet. You wouldn't worry, too?
M	This year in Russia we are celebrating 10 successful years in tennis. Just want to know what do you think about Russian tennis in whole and about the last ten years of Russian participants in particular.
M	Talking about Davis Cup, are you intrigued that the next opponent would consider playing with Great Britain?
M	Do you think we might see more serve and volley in the evolution of the game in the near future?
F	What happened out there today?
F	It didn't look like you had a lot of enthusiasm. Was it difficult to keep grinding?
F	But what about the confidence coming in here? It's been such a great summer.
F	What was the heat like?
F	How hot was it, and how did the heat compare with other hot matches?
F	You've played in all the big stadiums around the world. Is the wind in Ashe the windiest, or where do you rank it?
F	What are your thoughts about your next opponent and what she's done with her career since she was a young player?
F	Mirjana.
F	Are you familiar though with her determination to overcome injuries and the types of injuries she's had?
F	Do you remember her at Wimbledon in '99?
F	Do you remember anything about it, if you weren't?
F	Do you come into this tournament this year or any of the Slams this year with the same outlook that you've had, say, for the last four or five years, yes, I can still win of one of these things?
F	You think it was at all helpful to start on Ashe Stadium where you seem to have made a home last year?
F	In terms of the season, so far in terms of losses, did this feel really good for the first time this year and dominating a match?
F	You feel you've made progress?
F	What was the feeling like walking down that tunnel and you're going to be out there in the ballpark that was all yours last year? Were you quite nervous?
F	You were coming close to going to a golden set.
F	Did you think about that?
F	Since you left last year, what's been the one high point and the one not so high point?
F	What is the one key thing in your maturing process this year? How would you describe that or what would you point to?
F	Seemed like the whole match came down to one point when it was 30-All, and I think you were up 4-3 and going for the break. Did you tell yourself anything before that one point? I guess it was two points, 30-All and then the breakpoint which you won, and it was all downhill from there.
F	How much relief is mixed in with the fact that you won just to get this one out of the way?
F	How did you come up with "courage"?
F	Do you write something on your shoe at all tournaments, or just at Slams or just at the Open?
F	Has your training and practice routine changed since last year?
F	Have you grown at all since we last saw you? I mean physically.
F	You said recently everybody has one Cinderella story in their life. Yours was last year. But do you feel like you have a shot of getting back to the quarters or maybe even better this year?
F	How different is it for you to come into this tournament considering what happened last year as opposed to the year before where you had only played once before and were out in the first round.
F	Relatively unknown I think to the general public, and now that Cinderella run. Just talk about the difference of coming into the tournament.
F	What were your thoughts on John Isner's match at Wimbledon and how he's handled all of the attention since?
F	How do you feel you handled last year's success here, you know, after the Open until now?
F	Seems like you spent a lot of time in the last year trying to tell people, Look, don't expect this out of me every week yet. Did you ever have to tell yourself that?
F	Is there anything you like better about being an unknown? Is there anything you don't like being about being the more famous Melanie Oudin?
F	Describe a little more about how is it different. How is it different being on the court as someone who is expected to win?
F	You said you wished you wanted to be taller. Do you feel like it is a disadvantage to be your height out on the tour now when you are looking up at most everybody?
F	You chose the word "courage," and in tennis there are lots of examples of courage from, you know, Blake and Ashe, the Williams sister, Monica, and so forth. Is there an example courage that means a lot to you? Talk about that quality. What does it mean to you?
F	Is there an example, whether it's Isner at Wimbledon or some of the others, of courage in tennis that you could point to?
F	When you say buckle down on those late points, what do you do? Is there a routine?
F	How does playing in front of a New York crowd at the Open differ from the other majors our other places around the world?
F	You talked about being nervous a couple times. What do you do when you're out there feeling nervous? And building up to it, how do you calm yourself down?
F	How is becoming known because of what happened here last year affected your life off the court for better or for worse?
F	Do you have a favorite story from being recognized where you might not have been a year ago?
M	Your served looked like it was giving you a little bit more problems than usual today.
M	You had 20 winners and 29 unforced errors. Was that maybe being too aggressive possibly?
M	There's been a lot of talk about your physical condition. Was that a factor at all today?
M	Are you happy with your return game? First returns were really low. Was that a function of Andy's placement? You both served about the same speed-wise.
M	Yeah. Your returns statistics were low. I was wondering, is that a function of Andy moving the ball around on you?
M	Heading to New York, are you happy with where you're at?
M	Towards the end of the match, right when you broke Andy almost the next to the last game of the set, then you got broken immediately back, what happened there?
M	You had a lot of breakpoint opportunities today. I didn't see the final stats, but it was tough converting them. What was he doing, aside from the pace on his serve, that made it tough for you to convert?
M	Are you completely recovered from your illness, and how long has that affected you?
M	The weather hasn't been as hot as it can be here sometimes. Is that helpful to you?
M	Was experience the decisive factor today in your match?
M	I know you were kind of trying to mix up your game a little bit, go to the net once in a while. What factors do you consider when you decide that, Okay, I'm gonna go to the net?
M	When you pulled out of, was it Rome or Monte-Carlo? I can't remember. But when you pulled out of...
M	Oh. Do you think the mono went all the way back that far?
M	Okay.
M	Your next match will be either Soderling or Hewitt. You're 1-2 against Soderling, and you've tied up with Hewitt 6-All. Talk a little bit about potential matchups with those guys, what you have to do really well.
M	Do you have any preference?
M	You've won the last five matches against Hewitt, so I didn't know if maybe...
M	An American hasn't won the US Open since you did it in '03? Do you think it would be a boost for U.S. tennis if you or another American could win it?
M	I guess those things, and also just kind of the whole image of it. This is the first time in a long time there hasn't been a top 10...
M	I'm doing a feature on the ball girls and ball boys here at the tournament. What do you think of them. You can be pretty intense on the court. What advice would you have to a newbie?
M	Who was the player you really admired when you were coming up as a ball kid?
M	Congratulations on your win. You now face Nadal. You only played him once, and that was earlier this year in Miami. What is the key for you to do really well, to have a chance out there?
M	Is it nice getting those big guys, like playing Nadal, in the States where you know that you're gonna go out on the court and there's gonna be people right behind you from the outset?
M	You were in total control of the match today. What was the key to your dominance, do you think? Is there something about Lopez's game that matches up really well with yours?
M	When you hit the gym, what are the four most important exercises that you use to improve your tennis game?
M	You're one of the last serve and volleyers on the tour. Why do you think that playing style has fallen out of favor with your peers?
M	How has starting a family factored into your game positively, and if there are any negatives to it, even lack of sleep or something.
M	Is your family here with you?
F	Talk a little bit about Christina's game. Do you think she played like the 132nd player in the world?
F	How do results in earlier in the day affect you, if at all, just with all the other seeds losing?
F	So it didn't make you maybe focus on that part of your game a little bit more?
F	She commented that you were one of the players that she admires. You probably are now playing more of those types of players who admire you or admired you growing up. Can you tell us how that feels? And part B, maybe an example of when you did that when you were coming up.
F	Yeah.
F	Does an easy match like this, in a sense, does did make it more difficult to play your next match?
F	You only played her once before. Talk about that.
F	You get really incredible crowd support wherever you go. This is a maybe one of the few occasions playing an American where it might be more even. Why do you think it is that crowds always seem to favor you?
F	Is it a big help to you?
F	Can you remember the last time your opponent was heavily favored by the crowd?
F	How much attention to you pay to the stats after a match, and which stats do you look at in particular?
F	You had the opportunity to play here last year. What do you think about the new stadium renovations?
F	Is there much of a carryover affect - and I know you don't look at stats that much - but tonight you were dominant on almost every single thing. Service points won at 70%; return points won at 54%; only two double faults. I'm not going to go into the whole stats. I guess does that carryover into the next match, or is it so totally separate? It's nice, but has nothing to do with the next match.
F	Ana Ivanovic has had some disputes recently with the Montreal tournament directors about giving her a wildcard or not. When you made your comeback, twice, in '05 and '07, you were always able to get the wildcards that you needed. Any thoughts on that, and if former top players should be able to get wildcards into big events?
F	As a follow-up to the question about the fans, do you have any advice for the young players who watch you?
F	You seemed overwhelmed by emotion understandably at the end. Can you put into perspective what it all meant to you?
F	How difficult was it to deal with your frustrations during the match with the unforced errors?
F	You said before the match that you had to stop her from dominating. How do you do that, and why is she so dominant?
F	Do you think she's beatable?
F	After being involved in the final today, how do you use that as motivation to go one step further in future slams?
F	Can you describe her serve for us, what it's like facing her serve, what kind of spin she's using, those sorts of things.
F	There are very few players who play both singles and doubles. You're in both finals. To what extent has your singles game improved by having played doubles?
F	What was the whole experience of being in the final like? What was the morning like, the buildup, and how were you?
F	Most people would be really intimidated being in their first final. You didn't look intimidated at all.
F	Did you have to be persuaded to parade around with your trophy at the end? You didn't seem quite to know what to do.
F	If you had to characterize this tremendous two-week run of yours, how in a word or two would you characterize?
F	Does your drive for perfection help you in your career or is it sometimes a problem? Did you have any health issues before going into the final?
F	Of all the weapons that you've seen other players have, how would you describe Serena Williams' first serve as a weapon?
M	How would you say you came to lose that game today? How can you describe what happened today?
M	You won the first set.
M	Second one?
M	Did you become demoralized when he leveled at one set all?
M	That point in the tiebreak when you let the ball go off the return, is that the point in the match that you'd want back?
M	You were tending to the thumb a little bit. Was it bothering you?
M	What do you think you have to work on to improve your game to today?
M	Everyone in England will get excited about Murray maybe winning Wimbledon. How do you rate his chances?
M	Did the crowd worry you today?
F	Seemed to be a strong first set you had, but seemed to fade away a bit in the second. Couldn't keep up the intensity?
F	You always have very good games against her, although it's 5-1 her favor. You don't seem to be intimidated by her on the court; is that right?
F	A lot of players are intimidated by Serena Williams. You don't seem to be. You go out and seem to like to play her aggressive game against her.
F	How do you assess your overall Wimbledon this time around?
M	Is it fair to describe that performance as your best of the tournament so far from your point of view?
M	Was it your best performance in the tournament so far?
M	You will play Soderling in the quarterfinal. What's the key to beat him on grass?
M	Did you notice the police escorting a fan out at like the end of second set. I think you were waiting to serve when they were taking him out. Did you notice it at all?
M	Did you have any problems from your knee? If not, what did you do after the last game to make sure it was good for today?
M	Prior to the match, it was announced that you were fined $2,000. What is your reaction to that?
M	After the coaching accusation with your uncle from the last match, you were fined $2,000.
M	What are your thoughts about that penalty?
M	You've watched the World Cup you mentioned before during the week. What are your thoughts about whether there should be a replay rule video used in the World Cup?
M	You did win against Robin Soderling a couple of weeks ago in France. What do you think will be the difference playing here on grass?
M	Yesterday was Sunday. Did you have a chance to relax? What did you do? Did you go into London?
M	Just practiced?
M	Those biscuits, are they the Mallorcan biscuits?
M	Are you at all concerned about your knees for tomorrow's match, given you had to play back-to-back days, today and tomorrow?
M	Excuse me. But are you concerned going forward that they're just gonna continue to get sore or sorer?
M	How has your relationship with Robin changed through the years?
F	Can you talk about turning that match around?
F	How have you managed to push this rivalry in your favor?
F	Where were you in the first set?
F	It looked like you, but didn't play like you.
F	We're accustomed to having fireworks and drama when you two have met. What was different, if anything, today for you mentally as you got into the third set?
F	There's been a lot said about Justine and Wimbledon. Sentimentally people think she has the kind of game and maybe she should win here. It isn't as if your game is terrible here either on grass. Can you talk about what the tournament means to you, the grass court game, how it favors you in some ways?
F	What was the first time you played Justine when you were very young? What role do you think your size, your athleticism, plays in the matchup against Justine?
F	Who won that first match?
F	Were you about 10 years old?
F	Do you think the hot, dry conditions might be benefitting players that are a little more comfortable on a hard court, less sure of their footing on grass this fortnight?
F	The footing on the grass.
F	Yeah.
F	Was this a triumph for motherhood?
F	She was going for your forehand a lot, really trying to work it, find a groove. Is there a point at which somebody going to that one shot, you knowing it all the time, becomes an advantage to you?
M	Can you answer in English about Soderling? You met him a couple times. How do you feel about meeting him now?
M	Wimbledon has been your least successful Grand Slam. How are you finding the grass these days? Is it getting better? Easier for you?
M	After a bit of a tricky start, you seemed to have found a real rhythm in the last two games. Has the confidence built up with momentum?
M	Can you talk a little bit about the relationship with your coach? You've been together for a few years. Don't want to compare it to a marriage, but how do you keep it fresh?
M	How do you work on things so the messages keep coming across?
M	What is your tip for the World Cup?
M	Are you a sore loser?
M	Given that Australia beat Serbia, do you think you might try to get back at Lleyton?
M	Was it any consolation meeting the Queen?
M	Can I ask you how you are assessing your serve at the moment?
M	Your aces were quite high. I think your placement was very good. You seemed to have lost a bit of power. Would you accept that?
M	One of the great things about our sport is that we basically have the three different surfaces. Could you take a moment and talk about which one you think demands the most of an athlete, how they compare?
M	Does any one of those particularly require the most from an athlete?
M	You're the greatest mind we have in our sport, the greatest comic. We're in the print media. Before you did your imitation of John Isner, what qualities would you think before you went into a monologue?
M	Is it going to be Michael Jackson doing John Isner?
M	You mentioned, as a fan watching the Serbia game how frustrating it was, their loss. Do you think you're a frustrating player to watch on behalf of your fans?
M	If for one day you could be a fan and watch yourself on TV, what kind of advice would you give to yourself?
M	You've been pretty outspoken about your work on the players council. Can you talk about if you feel satisfied with your term on the council and talk about the election.
M	What was your verdict on the match?
M	Were there more nerves than normal?
M	What did the Queen say to you after the match?
M	Would you say that's as good as you've played maybe since Australia?
M	Is there a sense that when it's as big an occasion as it was today, that focus is probably the most important thing, just keeping your mind on the match and not letting it drift to all the other things going on around you?
M	Can you talk us through the bows? There was not one but three.
M	How special was it for you to play on an occasion like that?
M	Presumably she congratulated you on your win?
M	Seemed to be talking about the ground conditions at one point. She said it was very dry, didn't she?
M	I was going to ask, she seemed to be taking an interest in more than just what was happening on court. She was talking about things around the tournament, wasn't she?
M	Will that bring you a bit of luck, do you think?
M	Given the Queen's presence here today, did you find yourself having to watch your reaction at all when points didn't go your way?
M	Can you get your head around the concept of 60-All in the fifth set? Forget the Queen. What about that match, what it's doing for tennis at the moment?
M	In contrast, Gilles didn't play at all today. How much of a benefit or negativity is that for him?
M	If that was you in that situation, would you prefer a rule change where there was a cutoff or tiebreak situation?
M	Do you feel stronger than you did when you came into the tournament?
M	You've had some good matches with Gilles in the past. What are your thoughts on playing him again?
M	You said your bow wasn't great. Can't be that bad because I think you got a slow-motion replay of your bow.
M	There's a few minutes between finishing your match and meeting the Queen. Were you more nervous for that? Were there butterflies when you were going to meet the Queen?
M	Did you watch England?
F	Tell us what you were pleased about what you were doing and maybe there were things that displeased you.
F	Any displeasure, besides falling down, perhaps?
F	What about her power? You seemed to be having quite a baseline battle at some stages. You had to work pretty hard.
F	Can you talk us through your outfit today.
F	Your nails look good today.
F	Are you watching the World Cup and watching America?
F	Do you know who is going to win?
F	What are your thoughts about Thursday with the Queen's visit and how are your curtsy practices going?
F	What will it mean for you to have her here for your match?
F	When you were a child, did you think that Wimbledon was a place that the Queen always came?
F	What sort of outfit do you think would be suitable to wear on Thursday then?
F	Can you explain the rationale behind your outfit today? Generally, how do you go about choosing what you wear before a major Grand Slam?
F	Your serving stats today were pretty eye-popping. Was there a particularly special rhythm out there? Did you feel different at all?
F	Do you have a sense of what your record is in majors in first and second rounds? Do you remember ever losing in the first or second round?
F	What does that say about your concentration in those first two rounds when some players have some problems? We saw Roger Federer almost get knocked out yesterday.
F	The crowd really got behind your opponent today. Did you notice that at all? Did it bother you?
F	Is your curtsy where you want it?
F	Just a little less forced?
F	You're going to watch the USA football game. What's the tension like for you when you're watching the USA team?
M	I guess first of all, tell me about how you feel you played today, and did you feel as though you were getting into the match at a point?
M	Physically, how are you at this point?
M	When did it flare up, James? When was the first time you had a problem with it?
M	The original injury.
M	What other options were you given before you took the ten weeks off? Did they go in and scope it?
M	So the doctor said about surgery, if you elected to have it you could be out, what, six months, more?
M	When you say you're thinking of taking time, are you talking about taking more weeks off or something more permanent?
M	And you don't believe in antiinflammatories because?
M	You've been through some tough times before. The last year hadn't been great. You had the toe. I mean, obviously through it all, you've sort of said you still like being out here and enjoy playing tennis. Has that changed at all in the last few weeks? Can you talk about that?
M	When are you feeling pain? On and off the court? Are there certain movements?
M	Have you seen McEnroe's book, Patrick?
M	Nice escape, Roger. Did it occur to you at any point in that match you were going to lose?
M	Why did you have more belief the second time?
M	When you win matches like that, do you consider yourself more lucky, more good, winning on mind, or do you consider that the opponent was probably trembling a bit, weak? Mixed feelings?
M	During your six-year streak of going far in majors, how many matches have you had like this, this early, where you felt as though you could lose?
M	But how unusual were the feelings that you had during this match for you, especially here at Wimbledon?
M	How are you thinking about the rest of the tournament coming up?
M	How do you think he was able to stay with you so well in the rallies? You said afterwards he neutralized you.
M	How did you find the speed of the court?
M	You said the ability to learn never to panic helped you jump-start your champion career. Was there a moment where you sort of panicked today?
M	The momentum seemed to swing in the first set when it was 5-All. You had that distraction, you were about to serve. The ball boy came across. The umpire stopped the match.
M	5-All in the first set.
M	You were about to serve.
M	Any question of nerves because it's the first match? Was there a nervous factor?
M	It looked like your level of energy was very low. Was that the feeling you had, too?
M	Do you sense the crowd sort of panicking a bit for you?
M	What carries over for you moving forward? That fifth set or the struggles earlier?
M	Do you think it might have helped you to play him three times in a row?
M	What's it like being a dad at Wimbledon?
F	How satisfying is this one compared to the first one a few years ago now?
F	This year, five finals. What's the key for you?
F	Given that you haven't played since the US Open, is there any sense in which you surprised yourself winning here, or did you always think you could get over that obstacle?
F	Can you put a couple of words on Caroline's performance today and compare the match a bit to the match you had a year ago in New York?
F	Correct me if I'm wrong, this is your first appearance in Doha and the big title. Is it a good sign for you to come back again?
F	Back to the game again. It is relatively easy, your first set, and then the second set you were leading, what happened in that game?
F	Regarding your opponent, Wozniacki, is it lack of experience that sets it for her today?
F	How do you see her in general for the coming years?
F	Obviously the women's tour fought a long time to have this two-month break at the end of the year. When you have a week like this at the end, are you kind of...
F	You're happy with a couple months off?
F	When do you think you will start to perhaps concentrate or have a look again at your tennis? Maybe three weeks?
F	Have you had a chance to talk to your family back home? Were they able to watch the match on TV today?
F	Do you think Caroline could feel extra pressure because she has something to prove because she's No.1?
F	My question is as mother and as a champion in the same time, and for me as a new parent, how do you manage to be successful in the two jobs? It's a hard job to be a mother and to play in tennis.
F	Next season Caroline will start the season at No.1, and all the public eyes will be on her because she's not won a Grand Slam. What's your advice to her? She is still young and has something to learn, I guess, the.
F	When you became No.1 before winning a Grand Slam, did you feel extra pressure about that?
F	You play a very beautiful first set; what happened after? You have a little bit less level?
F	What's happened at the beginning of the third set when you have something in your hand?
F	You have a ball for 2-2 at the third set. Do you think it was the turning point of the last set?
F	Tomorrow you have to play a special match because you are no more in the competition, but I suppose you want to win, so...
F	Perfect start?
F	You're used to it, you played here last year. Coming from other tournaments, coming to this one and going back outdoors again, is that a tough thing for you?
F	Bit more of a general question. At what point in your career did you think, I can be the world No.1?
F	So since so since you were a girl?
F	Dementieva Wozniacki is a big match. Were you disappointed by the number of empty seats?
M	What are your thoughts on that?
M	You missed an easy volley at the net on game point.
M	Is that because you're tired mentally and physically, as well?
M	How long will you rest?
M	Do you think you'll go back home for a few days?
M	You must be looking forward to that.
M	Is it concerning at all or is it also good that you got a couple of extra days off?
M	Will you touch a tennis racquet when you go home?
M	What is the one thing, Rafa, you will look forward to doing most when you go home? What will be the best thing about being at home for a few days?
M	Do you find it hard to switch off, to not think about tennis?
M	Are you confident you can recharge your batteries? Are you confident that you can recharge your batteries before Wimbledon?
M	First of all, what was it like playing at Queen's for you?
M	You said it was a dream come true. I'm sure the result wasn't what you wanted. How did you find Mahut?
M	You say there are positives to take out. You must be very pleased going into a senior match like that you come out quite well?
M	Obviously there's no Andy Murray or no Nadal here today. There has been a lot of British interest. How have you found the crowd and everyone looking at you with you potentially being the center of attention?
M	What do you hope to take from this looking at the Wimbledon fortnight?
M	How is it compared to child acting?
M	Was that the biggest crowd you've played in front of or maybe at Wimbledon last year?
M	How did you feel playing in front of a crowd like that?
M	A bit surreal going from juniors in Paris to here today?
M	What's the biggest difference? Is it power? Is it pace? What's the biggest difference?
M	Do you enjoy playing on grass?
M	Are you itching to get amongst the seniors permanently now, or are you quite looking forward to one or two final junior appearances and maybe winning some big tournaments?
M	What's it like hanging around amongst the seniors, being in the locker room and seeing Andy Murray around and that kind of thing?
M	What will you do in terms of from here through next week?
M	What about next week, week before Wimbledon? What will you do then?
M	I take it you weren't surprised to see Fratangelo winning after the way he played against you?
M	Do you feel you've got all the tools you need?
F	How difficult was that first set for you?
F	Yeah.
F	Were you sort of tentative, particularly with your serve? You seemed to build up the speed as the match went on with the serve.
F	How would you sum up your first match?
F	Nothing beats competing, Serena. What's it like to actually be out there in a competitive environment again?
F	Were you nervous?
F	What's the difference between anxious and nervous?
F	When you spoke to the umpire after the time violation, was that because she hadn't given you any indication that she was going to do that?
F	What do you remember of 1998 when you first came?
F	You made a remark at the end about how I hope you guys will give me a cheer. Was that because you felt the crowd had been a little bit tricky during the match?
F	Were you able to enjoy it today?
F	It's likely -- I think you'll be playing a repeat of the Wimbledon final probably rather quickly, more than you thought it might happen. Memories of that day perhaps?
F	It was over quite quickly.
F	You fell down in the last game. Have you been told that it's safe for you to do that now, or is it something you've been told to avoid?
F	Well, the medical opinions, that it might be dangerous for you to fall.
F	How was your fall? Did you feel anything on the injured foot at all? Is it okay now?
F	Do you think had it not been grass you probably wouldn't have been playing yet? Is it because it's the grass and you can perhaps get a bit more leeway with your movements and if you do fall, it's a little more cushion than falling on cement, for instance?
F	Any thoughts about the length of the match and not having played so well and it was quite warm out there?
F	Did you have any nice messages, good-luck messages from friends in the States yesterday and today?
F	Are you slightly disappointed that Andy Murray didn't take you up on your invitation to come and do a little bit of...
F	I wanted to know whether you designed your tennis dress, or is that part of your...
F	What color would you use to describe it?
F	Brigitte Bardot, perhaps?
F	Will you be back to defend the title next year?
F	A tear in your eye at the end of the match. How emotional was your fourth Grand Slam win?
F	How did you turn it around?
F	Was there anything you picked up in Sydney on her game that you were able to use to your advantage tonight?
F	We rarely see you so pumped up or emotional during a match. Does this one mean more than some of the others?
F	This year I read that this could be your last full-time year. Then I read that you want to come back and play the Olympic Games very much next year. Then that you may become a mother for the second time in 2013 and come back in 2015.
F	How do you explain these Grand Slam wins to your daughter? Does she understand what you've done tonight?
F	Li Na said she felt like she was playing in Belgium tonight.
F	Because of the support for you. Did you feel that?
F	Before your comeback you didn't go into the Grand Slams as the out-and-out favorite. The last two you have and you've won. Can you talk about contending with that feeling?
F	Tonight when you played the higher balls, eight times you made eight points. Why since you know her you didn't start since the first set with your experience? Were you somehow tense or you didn't think?
F	What happened to your teeth at the airport?
F	Are you going to name the mystery dentist?
F	All in all, there were 13 service breaks. What do you think happened to your serve?
F	How did your legs feel?
F	Would Li Na hit the ball as hard as Serena Williams at her best?
F	How big of a goal is it to win Roland Garros and Wimbledon? Are you playing for different things other than just major titles? Just for the love of competing, or would you really like to get those two other slams?
F	What does it mean to finally win a Grand Slam outside New York?
F	You had a great speech after the win. It was funny and well-said. I'd like to know if you had to think much before when you started, or it came out like that?
F	The Aussie Kim was just like that?
F	Will you be wearing green for the rest of the year in the Grand Slams?
M	What's the most difficult thing about playing him?
M	That was your toughest match of the tournament so far. Were you happy with your game, how you overcame his unpredictability?
M	Where is your game compared to when you played here last year?
M	How do you brace mentally when you see who's left in the tournament? There's a lot of great players left.
M	Rafa spoke the other day in the early days of his career not really feeling like he belonged. Did you have a breakout match that you can think of?
M	How do you feel now compared to then?
M	I read some article which says maybe when you were 13 or 14 you played Rafa in a junior tournament or something. You lost. That's when you decided to go to Barcelona. Is that a true story?
M	You made it to the semis pretty smoothly. Do you feel you have an extra gear that you haven't used yet?
M	Do you feel like the pressure is off given that Roger and Rafa are Roger and Rafa and Djokovic is in such good form? Do you think this is a time that no one is putting the pressure on you?
M	Does the burn get greater to want to win one the longer the time goes?
M	You were talking to yourself a lot out there today and gesturing. What were your thoughts? What were you saying?
M	Not including this tournament, you've earned $14 million in your career. Royal Bank of Scotland is one of your sponsors. Do they manage your money?
M	Do you invest in property in Scotland?
M	Where?
M	Do you feel the support you have here? Seem to be a lot of people on your side.
M	Did you go and see Billy Connolly last night?
M	Did he make any reference to you in his act?
M	Should he have?
M	Can you compare the win against Rafa at the Australian Open last year against the loss at Wimbledon to him?
M	How you played.
M	You've talked about having a lot of British support here. Do you think you're starting to win over some of the neutrals in Australia?
M	And what about Dolgopolov? Do you think you're going to be encountering him at this stage in tournaments in the future?
M	Most people say that the depth in men's tennis is always increasing. In most slams maybe all four of you four guys at the top are in the semis. What is your explanation for this? There is still quite a big gap.
M	Does that give you the confidence that you can beat these guys in front of you at any given time?
M	Yet at the 02 when you played Rafa in the semi, you sat in your chair as long as he sat in his chair. You weren't standing up at the net waiting for him. Are you going to adopt the same policy? Every other player appears to spend half an hour hanging out in the corridor or in the chair.
M	Do you think he's playing mind games with his opponents or that's just what he does?
M	Were you disappointed with your form? Was Novak in the zone? How do you assess the match?
M	Overall, are you happy with how you've played through the tournament and where you're at with your game?
M	He seems to be on a bit of a roll with the Davis Cup through this month as well. Where do you think he is, and can he go all the way?
M	Czech Republic has played incredible tennis last two years in Davis Cup finals. Semifinal last year. Do you think with Kazakhstan, first round at home, you can still have a nice progression to the final stages?
F	You lost the first set and then came back to win the match. Can you tell us how you went in the first set and then how you got back into the game?
F	Flavia said she's beaten you three times and you won one prior to this, and she thought you improved greatly. Would you agree with this? And where have you improved?
F	No, overall since your last meeting.
F	Did you feel different going into this match to the match against Stosur?
F	Why do you think you were more nervous today against a lower-ranked player?
F	Have you had this happen before from a big win going into a next game...
F	A slower start in the next game?
F	You can't explain it?
F	You made a lot of mistakes in the first set, and then suddenly something changed. Pennetta had the chance to go 2-0 in the second set. Do you think that was the key moment, because you were able to escape that situation?
F	Pennetta in the first set had 76% of first serve in. In the third set only 43%, so less than 50%. Did that help you a lot, to find the return, to make points?
F	You had two games where Pennetta was Love-40, so you had three breakpoints each game. She came back to win each game. Were you worried you weren't going to break?
F	Do you think you are playing better here than in Wimbledon? Has something changed, apart from the surface?
F	There are not many lefty players on the tour. Do you try to use that as an advantage?
F	You are a left-handed player. You are No.1 in the world for lefty players.
F	Do you try to use that?
F	You're stroking your hair. Is that a nervous thing?
F	This is a prior question. How long have you been wearing braces?
F	And for how long more?
F	How do you think you'll be feeling going into your next match?
F	Can you play with a bit more freedom, a bit more relaxed?
F	Caroline Wozniacki play for Prostejov.
F	Can you talk about that? Why did you do that?
F	You are very young, so you probably don't know how somebody can feel when they're 30 years old. Francesca Schiavone played 4 hours and 44 minutes. She has to play tomorrow Wozniacki. Do you have the feeling someone who is 30 years old can play another match two days after?
F	Who do you see favored in that match? Be honest.
F	Tell me the truth. What do you think?
F	What will you do over the next day and a half in terms of preparing and relaxing before your next match?
F	What did you do yesterday before this match?
F	Can you shut down your thoughts and not think about tennis?
F	How do you do that? What do you do?
F	What are you reading at the moment?
F	Quarterfinals at the Australian Open. Is in the best of your career?
F	About tonight's match, where did you think you beat Sharapova?
F	Were you getting flashbacks to Roland Garros after you got broken the first time?
F	Did you talk to your countrywoman Julia Goerges the other day about how that match went for her?
F	Could you talk a little bit about your dance? I know you already talked about the dance on the court, but how did you pick that kind of cool dancing move?
F	Yeah.
F	Where has your improvement come from over the last year or two?
F	This is a very big break for a tournament and obviously for you, and there doesn't seem to be a hint nerves in you at all. Are you just doing a good job of hiding it, or are you just really enjoying it, opening yourself up and enjoying the whole experience?
F	Can talk a little bit about 2008 you stepped on court and your knee got torn up. Talk about the process of getting back and now your a quarterfinalist here.
M	Your ninth in a row, yet to drop a set here. How do you assess your performance so far? Are you just cruising along very confident?
M	Do you need a four- or five-set match to test yourself?
M	Does that weigh in your favor, that you haven't gone outside three sets in that first week?
M	There's been a lot of attention on Roger and Rafa in the past couple weeks. Do you feel you're sliding under the radar in terms of media attention and that sort of thing?
M	Do you feel like you're ready to compete against those guys in the final of a Grand Slam and perhaps to go that step further?
M	Do you ever hear from Borg at all, best wishes? You've play better here than he ever did.
M	You may play against Tsonga. You never lost a set against him.
M	But you play well against him because you like his game?
M	Now you work a little more with your new coach, can you tell us a little bit about the relationship you have?
M	What kind of details?
M	When Europe is freezing and you come to Australia which is very hot, how do you adapt?
M	Roger and Rafa are the players who play always on the Rod Laver Arena. Sometimes you go other places. What do you prefer, to go on the center court or to play near to the crowd?
M	Not a big difference for you?
F	How did you feel you got into the match eventually? It was difficult to begin with, then did you feel you were getting into it a bit more?
F	What is difficult about her?
F	A semifinalist last year. Are you playing better now than this time last year?
F	What was good about your match today?
F	What did you like about your match today?
F	What were the conditions like?
F	What has changed on your team?
F	That's it?
F	What is that like, having your husband as your coach? How is that different?
F	Was that decision entirely yours and his or was the Federation having a say in that?
F	You say he's the boss on the court. Are you the boss off the court?
F	What do you think it would mean for tennis in China if you were to win a Grand Slam like here?
F	If you won this tournament, what would happen to the game in China? Do you think it would become much bigger?
F	What if China had a Grand Slam event?
F	Getting back to today's match, your opponent, did she have problems with the hot weather, did you notice?
F	Did you notice?
F	This surface suits you, though?
F	Was beating Kim Clijsters in Sydney important?
F	You played Azarenka before. You're likely to play her in the next round.
F	She's just about to, I think.
F	Have you played her before?
F	Have you beaten her?
F	Can you explain why Chinese women have done well but the Chinese men have done not so well? What is the reason for that?
F	Is the Shanghai event making much of a difference in China to making the game bigger?
F	We'll have to make you an Australian because you play so well out here all the time. Why is it you play well in Australia? Is it the conditions?
F	You obviously won in Sydney last week, Gold Coast a couple years ago, Melbourne the semifinals, so you obviously enjoy playing.
M	What were some of the positives you could take out of the match tonight?
M	With five matches to go before a possible final, what is your strategy? Do you have a strategy worked out or do you take it one match at a time?
M	This is unchartered territory for you at Melbourne Park. Why have your past campaigns been derailed so quickly?
M	Do you feel like your preparations this year were a little bit more involved? Do you feel this has helped your run into the tournament here?
M	Why did you decide to go to Brisbane?
M	Do you know much about your next opponent?
M	You obviously overtook Andy Murray's No.4 ranking coming into this tournament. Is that a mere statistic or does that give you a bit of an edge or a confidence boost?
M	How do you feel the surface and conditions here might suit your game or not suit your game?
M	What do you invest your prize money, like property or shares?
M	You must be feeling pretty good about your game, the way you're playing.
M	You've had a lot of long matches here. This could have easily been another one. Nice to finish it in quick time.
M	Are you feeling plenty of crowd support as well?
M	How far do you think you can progress?
M	What do you think about Jurgen Melzer? You're playing him the first time ever.
M	Where do you see your level right now? How close to your best form that you had before?
F	Was that a better match for you today?
F	Was your serve a key today?
F	You talked the other day about how your elbow needs a lot of time to warm up these days. Cold weather, first match, yet you started very well.
F	You said you needed matches to get your rhythm. Did that game today provide that?
F	You're No.2 on the bidding to win the title. Are you a good bet?
F	Do you feel like you're well placed in this tournament to win?
F	Do you notice ranking and seeding next to your name or do you just play, a double-figure ranking?
F	Did you come to Australia with as many clothes as you've ever brought before? Do you think the weather will have any effect on the draw, matches in a colder climate?
F	You play Kuznetsova in the third round. Your thoughts on that.
F	Obviously a pretty tough night.
F	How do you explain it? She's obviously in good form, but yourself?
F	Have you ever had that feeling before?
F	What does that tell you about where you're at, your motivation?
F	What about the emotion of the night? What has the night been like for the last hour?
F	What were you telling yourself emotionally during the breaks?
F	Does it hurt your pride more than anything else?
F	Are your physical problems solved?
F	So it's just mental probably?
F	Once Sharapova lost 6-Love, 6-Love to Davenport in California. That didn't mean she couldn't play after.
F	What does your coach say?
F	Do you have any memory of when you played well when you go out on court?
F	Do you feel in practice you're hitting the ball as hard and with as much depth as you used to?
F	Given the results as they stand, does it make you question your future in the game at all?
F	Do you regret the split-up with your former coach? New one, you didn't really make a big result.
F	Are you confident you can get back amongst the best players?
F	Doesn't sound like you're enjoying yourself now. You always said that is important.
F	Seeded No.1 on center court; a good win to start with. What is your assessment?
F	Match must have given you a lot of confidence then.
F	How were the conditions out there?
F	They called you Sweet Caroline in the newspaper the other day. Do you know that song? Are you familiar with it?
F	Are you familiar with the works of Neil Diamond, the singer?
F	As your ring tone?
M	Is that one of the best starts you've had to a Grand Slam?
M	How are the twins?
M	Are they showing any signs of good hand-eye coordination at this stage?
M	We still don't know the name of your next opponent. It could be Gilles Simon. He's one of very few players on tour you have a losing record against. Is that something that affects your preparation at all?
M	You talked about Paul after the game. You said he's a nice guy and you know him well. What else was it about him thought you thought he could help you? What was it particularly about Paul?
M	Going back to the memories you had about the match with Simon, normally you remember more the wins?
M	I'm just asking you if you remember more easily the wins, the loss, certain specific matches? Do you remember, in general, a lot of them or just a few very important?
M	Yeah, or the wins.
M	Do you remember when was the last time you didn't play on Rod Laver Arena?
M	You mentioned the dreams. Do you have bad dreams about losses in Grand Slam finals where you wake up in a cold sweat?
M	There are a few members of the England cricket team watching you play - a very successful team, by the way. Have you been made aware of the significance of what the England team has done here? Do you follow cricket at all?
M	The YouTube video where you hit the bottle off the guy's head, is that real?
M	You've never done it before and got someone in the face?
M	You're losing too many times. We're not used to that. How do you explain it? Do you know that losing, you have more chances to go to the semifinals now if tonight Ferrer beats Berdych?
M	You could be the first winner ever in the Masters Cup even if you lost two round robin matches. Never happened before, but you still have a chance.
M	When you think back to the early part of this year when you were winning all those matches, is there anything missing now that was there then?
M	It's obvious to all of us for obvious reasons you're not as fresh as you'd like to be. How is that showing itself in your daytoday life? Are you sleeping a lot, feeling lethargic?
M	After getting hurt in the Davis Cup, have you changed even just a tiny bit your service motion?
M	It's a very unique situation. How do you go about it? Do you now prepare that you play Roger Federer tomorrow or do you wait for the late match and then start preparing?
M	Yesterday Rafa said he's lost a little bit of his passion for tennis because of the fatigue. Can you understand how that can happen and has it ever happened to you?
M	Can you tell us what you'll do between now and the Australian Open after this tournament?
M	Will you make any changes to your schedule next year, bearing in mind the Olympics coming up? Probably that's a title you'd like to go for next year.
M	If you're going to lose to anyone, are you happy it's to Janko, especially as he gets a nice endofyear bonus?
M	In terms of confidence, imagine ending your season today, can this end of season be damaging for the start of the next one or are you still full of confidence from the past months?
M	Strange match. Two big servers indoors. Nine breaks of serve. Can you explain it?
M	The early part of the year you're winning first sets like that. They've got away of late. What's gone missing?
M	You had a fairly long exchange with the umpire at one stage. Was that part of the general frustration you were feeling? Anything sort of specific?
M	Looking ahead, you have one match left. How will you approach that one against Roger? Just go out there and have a bit of fun in a sense?
M	You mentioned being out of the rhythm with the injuries you've had lately. Having said that, when you look back the last couple matches, do you feel 11, maybe 20 if you would have won the first set today?
M	You talked respectfully about this tournament. It has another two years in London. Who knows after that. There's at least one American venue being talked about. How important would it be for boosting tennis in America for this event to go back to America for a few years?
M	What happened after the sixth game of the second set when you lost six games in a row?
M	You know what it's like when you get into a run of form and you feel so confident about everything in your game. Is that what you sense a little bit from Novak at the moment? Whatever the situation, he feels really good about it?
M	You know what it's like when you feel as though you're so strong.
M	Can you pinpoint why your serve went bad on you today? Can you tell us why you think your serve went bad on you? It seemed pretty good the first set, and then it just...
M	Anything you can point a finger to?
M	As you said, when you've had a month out of the game and you're not quite sure how strong you're going to be. To get a full week of tennis, even though you've lost the final, has to be somewhat encouraging for you.
M	In the second set, the long game that ended the set, you had a breakpoint. If you had gotten that, could that have turned it around?
M	During the trophy ceremony, Novak said that for him you were the best player ever. What were your feelings at the time? Is that something he said to you privately? Was that a surprise to you? How do you feel about that?
M	Could you talk a little bit about Novak's play? He's had this great run, maybe since Davis Cup, Australia, here. What has he done to pick it up? What's the difference?
M	What was going through your mind second set and third set? He won six straight games, and you said earlier you felt like you were playing well and wasn't a big difference. But when he wins six straight games, can you talk about how you're feeling and your frustration?
M	For the No.1 spot, who is the bigger threat, Federer or Djokovic?
M	I said threat.
M	Del Potro said the other day he thought Novak had the best return of serve at the moment. Del Potro the other day said he thought Novak has the best service return in the men's game at the moment. Would you agree with that?
F	That was a good win. How is your stomach issue today? You weren't feeling too good in the previous round.
F	I suppose you'll be watching the game tonight. Which one of the two opponents would you rather see in the final, and why?
F	You've been on tour for a few years. You've been a Wimbledon finalist. Does a result like this excite you? Does it thrill you? What kind of emotions do you feel?
F	What happened against Caroline a couple weeks ago? That isn't a normal type of defeat for you. You only won a couple of games. You couldn't find a way to put the ball past her.
F	What was the most satisfying area of your game today, even though you weren't feeling at your best?
F	If you happen to be playing Sharapova, what are your thoughts on that one?
F	You told the French press or in French yesterday that you have a 175 IQ.
F	That's very high.
F	How do you know that?
F	So for someone with 175 IQ, choosing tennis over math or painting.
F	With the amount of money you've made, I would not say that. But it's different, though.
F	You're very mathematical, correct?
F	So do you bring that in tennis? Do you see tennis mathematically on the court?
F	But thinking a lot also can be detrimental on the court.
F	But you also have your artistic side, right? You're a painter?
F	You do everything. You have the math side. You're into both sides of the brain.
F	Are you more of a mathematician or more of an artist on the court?
F	This is your father who is a chess player speaking?
F	As an artist, what trend do you prefer? More on the abstract or...
F	Impressionists?
F	It was a very big celebration for a quarterfinal win. Was that because you weren't feeling well?
F	So you have a flu? Is that what you have? Or a virus? Something that's giving you fever?
F	How did you get that much energy in the second set? You were running a lot for somebody who was sick.
F	Could you feel she was gathering a lot of momentum near the end of the second set so you really had to shut it out?
F	Did you feel a little bit her quality was improving as the match went on, or was that not something you sensed?
F	There are many players out on the tour who have very classic strokes. You obviously have different hitches and grips and so forth.
F	In any case...
F	No, I'm not. But my question is: Do you think your difference on your strokes and your serve, do you think that helps you in some way against opponents or not?
F	In between the points you take a lot of practice swings and service motions. Is that just a mental game to psych yourself up for the next point?
F	I think this is your seventh tournament just to start the year. Do you ever get tired of the travel, just the week-to-week grind?
F	Not at all? Not even a little bit?
F	So you are not lying on the couch watching the Australian Open saying, Oh, this is nice? I don't have to get up today?
F	Having not played your best tennis yesterday against Kim, how concerned were you coming into today's match?
F	If you win your next game and Caroline Wozniacki keeps her seed, then there's a good opportunity for you to make it further than you have at Indian Wells. What is your opportunity of the remaining competition at the tournament?
F	You have been the top French player more or less since Pierce and Mauresmo went away. Does that matter to you?
F	What's the T-shirt?
F	Seems pretty appropriate the way things happened.
F	They think it will dissipate...
F	We're here talking about backhands down the line and so forth, but what are your thoughts about the situation over there? It's in an area of obvious great interest to you.
F	Yeah, and just the nuclear...
F	You've been so impacted in your own life by Chernobyl and done a lot of wonderful work around that.
F	Are you a little cautionary about nuclear...
F	Incredible.
F	Solid outing today.
F	How important is it to you right now to put yourself in a position to win a tournament like this?
F	Can you just talk about the serve? You've changed your stance, is that correct, a bit?
F	Why did institute that, and what are you trying to do with that?
F	Do you feel like it helps the kick serve?
F	Is that a function of the racquet change or coaching advice?
F	Obviously you're a basketball fan. Can you comment on or talk about the basketball tournament, college basketball tournament? Were you paying any attention? Any thoughts on the Bruins or the Trojans, anything along those line, or are you just a pro fan?
F	Go Ducks.
F	Care to give us your NBA predictions then?
F	You have had a lot of ups and downs and really good wins and some disappointments. Is it more strategic things you've had to learn over the years or more stroke changes? Could you tell me a little bit about what you have had to focus on over these last two or three years?
F	Just to follow up on the Nike thing, they made a lot of special designs, Hepburn, red rhinestone. If you had to pick one that is still your favorite outfit, which would that be?
F	Yes.
F	The black one?
F	If I could just ask, it was mentioned about the racquet change. Sometimes it can be a pretty dicey thing. You haven't had that many tournaments, I don't think.
F	Could you talk about the change, how that's affected your game or your stroke?
F	Dinara said after she got back from the Australian Open she called her mom told her she was going to retire because she was so frustrated with just trying to come back from the back injury and all that goes into that. Can you just talk about your own experiences of, you know, being down at that level and then just trying to scrape through it?
M	Best win of your career, Donald?
M	Just talk about the match and how you felt and how you managed to pull it off.
M	Was there a point at which you're in the match and there is a point you realize, Hey, I got this?
M	No?
M	What does this do for your confidence?
M	Can you talk about hitting with Pete Sampras at Riviera last week? What did that do for you?
M	You said you've been in this situation before in a lot of tough matches, but you haven't been able to pull out. What did you do differently today to pull it out?
M	Do you realize it's been three years since you won back-to-back matches on the tour?
M	It's been a long journey for three years. You want to discuss that?
M	There have obviously been a few comments about your career. You haven't exactly been asked to go on Davis Cup, even though the rankings look pretty good. You were a pretty happy guy out there, a lot of heartfelt fist pumps. What does this win mean to Donald Young?
M	How important is Davis Cup? Is that something you're burning to have come in your career?
M	How long did it take for your phone to start to blow up when you started looking at it from all your friends?
M	What has the journey been like the last three years or so?
M	Was there an explanation? Were there physical issues?
M	Was there a moment when you said to yourself, I'm just not doing what I should be doing?
M	I've got to change?
M	How much burning desire do you have to be, say, a top 10 player?
M	What is the difference between Sam and Mardy's approach and what you were doing? What do they bring? Would you have redone it a little earlier in your career with all those wildcards you were getting?
M	And the difference between you and Sam and Mardy?
M	Donald, at 21 it's kind of ridiculous to say you're starting a second career. You turned pro at 15 or 16. Is that the mindset to bring to your career at this point to fulfill your potential?
M	Do you feel less pressure on court now than you did when you were 18?
M	You've been flying under the radar. If you start to come out of that orbit, are you ready to handle more expectations again?
M	When you hit with Pete and lost the groundstroke rally, were you just psyched out?
F	Congratulations, Agnieszka.
F	Talk about how big it is for you to win a tournament like China Open.
F	Could you tell us what happened in the second set? You seemed to have lost your form there and managed to get it back. What kind of mustered you for the third set?
F	How do you make it to win back-to-back two championships? How do you put together for your mental and the physical?
F	Yeah.
F	Would you consider these back-to-back wins something like a turning point in your career where it'll boost you up to the very top ranks? Also, how will you be rewarding yourself for winning twice in a row?
F	First of all, congratulations to win the China Open. I want to know can you talk about the performance of this year?
M	Congratulations on the win.
M	That was quite a grueling contest, three sets. Give us your thoughts about the way things went out there? And does this sort of take it out of you a little more for the rest of the competition?
M	In all your nine meetings against Mr. Youzhny, you lead 8-1. What do you think are the reasons?
M	(Through translation.) First of all, I would like to extend my congratulations on your win. As a veteran on the tour, you have participated in many big tournaments, and particularly the Grand Slam competitions. What do you think is the major difference between those big tournaments like a Grand Slam from China Open?
M	I believe that you've been to China many times. Have you noticed that the girls of tennis sport in China, like the popularity among the spectators and maybe the girls, the level of Chinese tennis players as well? And do you have any suggestions for like organizations organizing tennis matches in tennis, like China Open?
M	That was a great match. Congratulations on your success. I believe this is your first time playing in this new stadium, the Diamond. How did you like it?
M	Things seemed to go pretty smoothly for you out there. Do you have any particular thoughts about today's match and what sort of a start this is for the tournament for you?
M	Just moving away from here, are you a rugby fan, and will you be watching the match on Saturday? Are you concerned that it might clash with your schedule?
M	I still remember first time you came to China Open, and you came here as qualifier. Now you're a top seed. What does this kind of story mean to you? You have anything to say?
M	It is ATP 500 tournament, but we see a lot of top seeds pulling out of the tournament, such as Novak Djokovic and Robin Soderling. So far you're the top seed. Do you think you have a chance to win this tournament here in Beijing?
M	You said you have a problem of consistency, but this year you defeated Roger Federer two times. Did you find the key to defeat him because you upgrade your level or because he's a little bit old?
F	(In Serbian.)
F	Your opponent today is over 40 years old. Have you ever imagined that in your tennis career or your life when you're 40 or just 30?
F	Your opponent is over 40. Have you imagined your life or career after 40, after 30?
F	(Through translation.) Congratulations on your win. Yesterday your compatriot, Jelena Jankovic, lost the match. Have you had any contact with her after the match? And recently have you had any communications with your compatriot Novak Djokovic?
F	The Serbian local newspaper reports that Novak Djokovic will be married at the end of this month. Have you heard about this? Because other female player didn't know about anything at all.
F	I would like to know what do you think of the current women's tennis? You know, more and more women's players have been major titles winners, also the very young women's players. You used to be the world No.1 and you have the French Open title. How do you see that? It's very unlike men's tennis.
M	Can you just take us through some of your emotions.
M	So definitely positives to take away from the performance, do you feel? You feel positive after your performance?
M	Do you think the key to beating him was to mix it? Because you had some lovely top spins from both flanks, and then you produced the lovely slice on your backhand. You were mixing it up a little.
M	You say he's now the fastest in the world. A friend of yours has a stake to that claim as well.
M	What else has improved in his game in, say, the last couple months?
M	So where now for you? Straight into Davis Cup?
M	When do you link up with the team?
M	Do you feel coming back here where you've done so well before is part of the reason you played so well tonight?
M	Why don't you start with your thoughts on the match.
M	Was there anything about playing him that was different from how you always imagined it would be to play him?
M	What's the learning you take away from playing your idol?
M	Generally when Roger plays here, almost everybody supports him. But here we saw the crowd largely in your favor. That must be kind of different as well.
M	What was your game plan at this start of the match?
M	What is it about that serve?
M	There are not so many Asian men's players on the tour. What do you think the key points are for an Asian men's player to develop and be a player on the tour level?
M	If you were playing against somebody like Novak instead of somebody who was your idol, how different would that match have been for you?
F	Pretty important to win that off her set points, wasn't it?
F	How much of a help to you is your father when he comes on court?
F	Did he, because you asked for him early, didn't you, after you played poorly at the start?
F	These are things that you know, or when you listen to him, does it calm you down?
F	You were down 4-1 and actually she had four set points. What were you thinking through that whole process? Because you repeatedly came back that first set.
F	40-Love and then...
F	One thing that she talked about is she called you probably the best defensive player on the circuit. For people that are maybe seeing you for the first time, you think you showed that today? I mean, you really were reaching the points or going way beyond in the court, and she didn't seem to have that mobility.
F	Back to your father coming on court. The TV commentator suggested that perhaps the reason you haven't won a Grand Slam yet is because you're not allowed to have your father there. How much you miss him during a Grand Slam?
F	Do you think it's an advantage having your father as a coach? A lot of women players have fathers as coaches, and maybe fathers can be harder in what they say.
F	Can he be hard on you sometimes?
F	I understand both your parents have a sporting background. Does it help that they both perhaps know what you're going through?
F	How does the first final of 2011 feel to you?
F	No hangover then either, which happens to quite a few players, you know, losing in the Grand Slam semifinal. But you've bounced back.
F	You won six tournaments last year. I mean, I'm not sure if you're one of the people that kind of thinks -- would you go beyond that this year? Do you think you're in that kind of form? Do you even think like that? Or is it just one take tournament at a time?
F	When compare the Australian Open to now, how would you characterize your form? Were you playing the same there and it just didn't work out, or do you feel something come together in this tournament that wasn't there?
F	Do you think it's unfair when people criticize you or when people talk your game and they say, She gets lots of balls back, but she hasn't got a big weapon? You've got to No.1 in the world. Do you think that's unfair when you hear people say that?
F	That was good, wasn't it? You must have enjoyed that.
F	Why were you able to win it so easily?
F	Are you finding that the gap between the top-10-ranked players and the outsiders is sort of narrowing?
F	With that, do you find that if you're ranked outside the top 10 you might have a slight psychological advantage with nothing to lose?
F	Vera said you seemed to really enjoy playing against the top 10 players.
F	So when you think back on today's match, what were some of the key points? What do you think you had that she didn't have today? Was it the serve?
F	Confidence-wise, knocking out the No.2 seed, you're now in the quarterfinals. You must feel very confident in perhaps progressing even further from here.
F	Is it difficult to face fellow compatriots, perhaps Fed Cup teammates and so forth? Is it harder in some respects?
F	The way you're playing now -- and you said your game is really on -- looking ahead, is this a tournament that you have in your sights that you think you can definitely win?
F	In the second set, there was a stage where it could have gone either way. There were shots won and shots lost. What was going through your mind at that time?
F	Why was that so tough?
F	What do you think got you through the match?
F	You've done well here in the past. Is this somewhere that suits your game, the conditions here?
F	So what did you learn from coming out of today? You did have seven double faults. What do you have to work on going into your next match?
F	You served for the match twice and didn't serve it out. Does that affect your confidence?
F	On one side was it the sun or the wind? What was the problem?
F	You've been in and around the top 10 for quite a long time now. What do you think you need to do to make the breakthrough, in the Grand Slams particularly? I think quarterfinals is your best so far, isn't it?
F	Is it a question of keeping up a level for two weeks, seven matches?
F	I was going to ask, Victoria, while you wouldn't have chosen to get through the way you did today, do you feel it gives you a sort of instant competitiveness that perhaps other tennis players that have got through easier haven't had? You've come through a tough test and you're ready for subsequent ones if they come along?
F	Have you spoken to Caroline, your good friend? You're both at opposite ends of the draw. I presume you have the same agent or representation. You went out for dinner I think the other night. Do you liaise on that level?
F	Something else we don't know about you, how many pair of shoes have you got?
F	How late did you both stay at the party?
F	Wow.
M	So how did it feel winning tonight and coming back from the knee injury and everything you've been through in the last year?
M	How close do you think you are to getting back to your best?
M	What about your opponent tonight? It's now a 5-nil record you hold against him, but he's still a pretty tricky opponent.
M	Viktor got a bit firey and seemed to lose his cool. Is it difficult for you to keep your cool in that sort of situation?
M	Looking ahead to the Australian Open, obviously you've got to get through the first round, but you've got Roger second round. Pretty tough task?
M	You made a great start today, and then things got a bit more difficult. What happened in there?
M	How do you feel now?
M	You think you will recover for tomorrow?
M	Is it going to affect the way you're going to approach tomorrow? Will you change your game plan?
M	How will it set you up for the Australian Open? Obviously you're tired now, but you will have played a lot of matches this week. Do you feel like that will be good preparation for the Australian Open?
M	Physically you have some problem because the preparation was very hard, or because you need still more to work?
M	So you had an excellent off-season? Where did you train? Did you train somewhere hot?
M	You mean weights in the gym type weights?
M	In terms of the men's game now, how tough is a tournament like this running up to a Grand Slam? Might get fewer and fewer people.
M	You're at the edge of the top 20 now. I presume your goal for the year is to get even higher up the rankings. How far do you feel you can go this year?
M	You've got a win over Federer this year. Did that make a difference to you in terms of what you felt like you could achieve in your game?
M	But that you had belief even before you beat Federer or is it...
M	What do you think of the possibility of the so-called Rafa slam? What does it mean for you that he may win the four slams in a row?
M	Do you think it's possible?
M	Huge, can it be very huge? How big of an achievement do you think it could be?
M	You say you're tired now and you're suffering from the humidity and exhaustion, but you say you're mentally strong. How assured are you of winning this tournament? How confident are you about winning this tournament?
F	So a more difficult day for you today. What was happening out there on court?
F	Did you have to call your husband on te court when you lost the second set?
F	So maybe in the future you won't call him when you're in trouble.
F	You were talking about jet lag yesterday. Have you recovered a little bit from that?
F	Sleeping a little better last night?
F	So you weren't sleeping on the way to the match today?
F	What do you hope to improve this week to be ready for Melbourne?
F	So for today, what do you want to do better in your next match?
F	Just going to ask you again about your husband. I know you've been sort of joking about him for the last couple days. Was it him that persuaded you to come back to tennis when you took the time out to go to university? Tell us a little bit about how your relationship as a player/coach has developed.
F	Just going back again, when you took time out to go to university, did he persuade you to come back and try tennis again? I read you didn't want to come back and play tennis again.
F	This was 2005? National Games?
F	(Question regarding managing the shoulder during the match.)
F	Have you ever been involved in anything like this, where a player ran off the court in the middle of a game?
F	Did it throw off your rhythm at all?
F	What makes your game work better when you can't serve as well? Do you concentrate more or do something differently knowing you can't serve as you might want to?
F	Starting the second set, you win 10 games in a row. What changed during that period of the match?
F	So when she got back to 4-3, were you thinking, No way she maintains this level? Or were you thinking, Now I might have to raise my game even more?
F	One, it doesn't look like you get very tired. Only a couple times when you were running. Number two, it looked like you were playing inside the court, trying to push her back. You were dictating a lot of the points.
F	I could hear you joking with the crowd afterwards about Starbucks. Can you talk about that.
F	Are you working on a new sponsor?
F	In the final game when you were serving for the match, she started playing really well. Did you feel any pressure that you needed to really serve that match out then because she had found herself again?
F	Did you feel like you played a good service game? You weren't nervous at all?
F	When did you make up your mind that you could actually play today?
F	You've won other events. Do you count this as the biggest victory of your career? I know you won Eastbourne.
F	Can you talk a little bit about what different challenges either Vera or Ana will provide tomorrow? Will you have to play differently depending on each one of them?
F	Are there different keys to doing things well against Vera as opposed to Ana?
F	You haven't won a tournament since 2008. You've gone deep in a lot of tournaments, beaten a lot of good players. I would think winning another tournament would be important to you mentally?
F	So you feel ready physically, mentally, the whole thing?
F	Can you talk about how the court surface compares to the one from last year.
M	You started 3-1 up. What happened after that?
M	How difficult is it to get focused the day after beating Federer?
M	Your back hurt?
M	Good start to the clay season getting to the semifinals here. Pleased with your work?
M	Just about yesterday. Whenever Federer loses, there's talk of a crisis. Do you sense his level dipping a little bit at the moment or not?
M	David doesn't have the most impressive shots on the tour. What makes him so difficult to play?
M	You had him in trouble when he was serving for the match with the two breakpoints. Did you hurry a bit or good defense from him?
M	Just what you said about the start of the match. He took about 10 minutes to hold his serve. Did you generally sense that he was nervous at that point?
M	How much do you enjoy playing on clay courts?
M	At 4-All, do you have any regrets about a particular shot?
M	Is it difficult for you to know whether you should move forward to put pressure on him or stay back without allowing him to be in control?
M	In the beginning you were able to make him stay behind the baseline without forcing it. Is it tough to maintain that pressure for a long time?
M	Did you play the match you wanted to play against him?
M	You believe, apart from him, you wouldn't have problems with any player on clay now?
M	Do you believe he's improving consistently or is he just staying at the same level?
M	Is he still able to surprise you, like with that passing shot?
M	You might be able now to give him some advice for his next opponent.
M	What should you do against him?
M	In your particular game is there anything you did that gave him trouble?
M	It seemed to me that when you were forcing him to run forward, it was good for you.
M	You played well. The only weakness today maybe was your first serve?
M	A nice workout, 50 minutes?
M	Were you especially pleased with the way you were finishing points at will, the way you wanted to play?
M	One assumes, as experienced you are, the first game on a new surface is always a little bit of a touch of nerves.
M	Every time you play a tournament, you play to win it. What does it mean for you the fact that Nadal won six times in a row this tournament?
M	I wanted to know your approach. If you get to the final, are you happy, or if you just get to the final you're not happy because it's not enough?
M	How did you find Federer today?
M	You said yesterday that you wanted to play to a top 10 standard this year. Do you feel you did that today?
M	What did you do well? You hit the ball well sometimes?
M	Yeah.
M	What do you expect from yourself in Australia?
M	If you compare now Federer playing at very high level to others like Rafa, Novak, Andy, when they play on the really best level, who is the most difficult for you to play when they are top, top?
M	You played him so many times. Is this the best match he played against you?
M	But he never played better against you than today?
M	It's your first time here. What did it feel like? Does the court feel good and the conditions? Tell us how it feels.
M	Tell us about yourself. You had a lot of injury problems last season. You thought you got over them and it came back. Are you completely fit and free? Tell us about how you feel.
M	What do you hope for during this coming year?
M	This time of the year leading into Australia, does that give you a special buzz, a special memory?
F	Is that one of the best wins of your career, do you think?
F	Fair enough. You're honest.
F	Just satisfaction, happiness.
F	What is your best victory in your career?
F	Can you explain why you were in qualify, you were injured and now you are in good shape? Can you explain exactly what happened these months?
F	Do you think you have the same level as when you were in Australia last year now? Do you have the same level of tennis today compared with the Australian Open last year?
F	Francesca was saying, you know, today she just wasn't feeling right. Sometimes you come to a tennis tournament, and maybe your mind is not there, or you're physically exhausted or you're emotionally exhausted. Do you understand what she means? Sometimes as tennis players, you play so many tournaments, you're traveling all over the world. Do you understand what she's sort of going through?
F	This is your first win in the main round here. Last time you lost after winning the first set in 2008. But it's a brilliant start for you in the main round? Good start in the main draw? Good match win in the main draw? I mean, because last time you had lost in the first round after winning the first set. But this year, this time getting...
F	Yeah, getting the first win in the main round with victory. Brilliant start? What do you think? After you won -- you had lost the first round in 2008.
F	In Doha. So first victory in the main round. It's a brilliant start to the tournament in the main round for you. Better start to the tournament this year? Better than 2008?
F	How do you feel just to play Marion Bartoli tomorrow?
F	You've got 20, 24 hours now before that game. What do you do? What are you going to do? Do you sit in your room and watch DVDs? Do you go do painting like Marion?
M	Is there even more satisfaction to win a match when you fought off three match points in it?
M	As a player is there a physical skill and mental skill you're proud of? Being mentally strong, it sometimes separates players. Is that something you would pride yourself in?
M	Do you remember many matches in your career where you fought off a lot of match points?
M	And won the match?
M	You are really lucky. You saved one match point yesterday, three today. Who is protecting you?
M	Seriously, do you have protection?
M	What do you expect for your match against Djokovic tomorrow?
M	But how will you approach that match? What will the conditions be?
M	You could say, for example, that it's fun playing against him?
M	Well that's a good answer.
M	Was it a good choice to play Washington, making a lot of efforts lately?
M	But aren't you a bit tired?
M	What do you think of the crowd here in Montral?
M	The match against Djokovic could be a good test for you.
M	You've played Troicki before?
M	For your next round, Bellucci, you played him at the French, what kind of match do you expect there?
M	Will it be harder because it's a different surface?
M	Just describe how you thought you played today and where your confidence is right now.
M	The only time when you were shaky today was when you served against the kid on the court.
M	So it was really the only time when you were tense, otherwise you played a very clean match. It was completely different than your other match against the same player.
M	What did you do since Davis Cup?
M	When you were off, you didn't even touch a racquet?
M	Have you been working with Sebastien and Ricardo?
M	What do you think about your draw? As we say, it seems to be a lucky draw for you.
M	How do you explain the great improvement in your ranking lately?
M	There are four French players in the top 20. It's good for French tennis.
M	Did working with Sbastien Grosjean change anything for you? Did you change your approach?
M	Do you think the French players have a chance to win this tournament? You almost did it in Toronto.
M	You made the final in 2006.
M	You're talking about another life. What has changed?
M	Maybe you have less pressure now than in the beginning of your career where you had many expectations on you.
M	What can you improve in your game to catch up with the top players?
M	In France, do you have younger players up-and-coming?
F	Does it feel a little bit like deja vu this week again?
F	Can you just talk a little bit about how your shoulder is doing?
F	After the win last week, I'm just wondering how you're feeling about your game, because obviously you're rolling through this tournament, as well.
F	Very dangerous opponent today. How is it you've matched up so well against her thus far in your career? I think it's four straight wins against her.
F	You were 3-Love up and then it was 3-All and then it was Love-30. Did you feel then it was slipping away a little bit?
F	Does it make it harder with the shoulder to really believe you can come back?
F	Do you know exactly what it is with the shoulder?
F	You have a new coach. Do you think that played a role in your recent wins?
F	Do you feel that your ranking is a bit misleading right now just with the way you have been playing?
F	Do you feel like you're a better player than what your ranking is showing?
F	Is your goal to win a Grand Slam or to be No.1? Is that what you're always thinking about?
F	Which of the Grand Slams do you think you might have the best chance at?
F	Can you just talk about playing Stosur tomorrow and how that matchup looks to you?
F	What's special about your game?
F	You must know what you do well, what you think you do well.
F	Definitely your clay court is where -- I think it's safe to say it's your strongest court. This is your first hard court tournament since Wimbledon, your first tournament since Wimbledon. How do you feel heading into the US Open? Do you feel you're going to have enough time to get ready? Do you feel you will be a threat on a surface that is not your strongest?
M	Would you say in all the circumstances, that was one of the most satisfying days you've had?
M	I know it's a predictable question. You look like you belong right at the top. In terms of looking forward, thinking sort of Grand Slam and world No.1 ranking, what is your immediate ambition?
M	With this win, next week you pass Roger in the rankings. How does that feel? I know it's one of your goals for the year, to get to No.3. Then if you could also talk about Roger's position in the game at this point. Do you think he'll be contending next year for Grand Slams?
M	What especially about the achievement of these three weeks pleases you most? Just keeping the momentum going? Slightly nervous match today because of the situation riding on it, I suppose.
M	I know you have just opened a microblog account.
M	Why did you choose such a channel to communicate with your Chinese fans? How will it relate to your personal Twitter?
M	After three tough weeks, how does the body feel? As you sort of monitor and study yourself, what has the resilience of these three weeks told you?
M	So hypothetically you would be all right to start another tournament tomorrow? I'm not saying you're going to, but...
M	Would you have been fit enough to do that this time last year or a couple years ago?
M	You talked about your defeats to Rafa and Novak this year. Quite apart from what the rankings might say, does it feel to you on the court as the gap between you and those two is inching closer and closer?
M	Your game seems always stable and consistent, less errors than your opponents. Do you think it's enough for the Grand Slam stage? What else do you have to improve to claim a major?
M	Defeating Rafa, overtaking Federer, defending your title here, which one satisfied you the most?
M	I assume you're pretty happy with how you served today.
M	It's a fairly impressive statement of intent, a win like that against a very fine player. Does the roof being closed change things at all?
M	Did you just feel more comfortable out there generally today compared to the first two rounds in? Your net play was pretty good overall.
M	This hasn't been a particularly happy hunting ground for you. Getting that first one under your belt, the first win here this week, the incentive from that do you think perhaps has raised you to the next two performances?
M	Andy and Rafa have been saying how difficult it has been adjusting to a different ball from tournament to tournament, Bangkok to Tokyo to here. How have you found it?
M	You said the other day about the divide and rule, how the players appear to be divided. I think that's how I interpreted what you said. How do you then see or what would you bring to any discussions, should you attend? How would you try to unify all the players as you try to make some changes?
M	Of course the day after we spoke, the NBA delayed their season by two weeks. Has that given you extra incentive, seeing what's happening in that sport, to pursue your argument?
M	Can you tell me some differences between the back-to-back competitions, Beijing and Shanghai?
M	What are your feelings about them?
M	So you have a good holiday here?
M	Do you want to talk about how you felt at the end of the match. I saw you get a little bit angry when he broke back at 5-4 in the second set after you got the break. How were you feeling at that point and how did you close it out?
M	Although you're not playing as well as you might want to, it must give you confidence you're getting the job done.
M	What would be a satisfactory ending to the year for you?
M	What would be acceptable?
M	What do you make of him? A couple of years ago he was going to be the next big thing. He's come up gradually. What did you see out there tonight?
M	You mentioned yesterday you may have to think about changing the way you prepare, the way you train. Is it going to affect the way that you're going to play the game, as well? Do you think you're going to have to change things?
M	Do you ever feel like you're too hard on yourself? You always seem to be taking yourself to task.
M	When you say you've got to be aggressive, does that mean you've got to hit the track? Does it mean you have to hit the gym? Does it mean you take time off the court?
M	It seems like you started a little bit of a trend with moving to Austin. It's becoming Tennis Town. Can you talk a little bit about that.
M	What facility do you use?
M	Yes.
M	Rafa and Andy Murray were in here today casting doubt on whether any discussions would take place this week about the schedule, how to approach the tour about that. I want to ask your response to that and whether you think it's going to take one player pushing this effort forward, getting everybody together at the right time.
M	Returning to the theme of the younger players. Given the number of questions over the last couple of years about the state of American tennis you've had to field, you must be delighted to see the likes of Donald, Alex and Ryan putting in great performances here in Shanghai?
M	Going back to what Andy was talking about earlier. He was saying that he fears these talks about talks and scheduling and so forth could make the players be seen as spoilt. He says that money isn't really the issue. Is that something that you fear, too? Yesterday you mentioned the money.
M	Would it be fair to say you were a little happy to see the rain?
M	You were skidding a lot. It was almost like you were playing clay court tennis for a while. Were you having trouble with the footing?
M	When you get off to a patchy start like today, aside from the rain, is the fact that you've been winning for the last three months, is that something you draw on? You talked about confidence. Is that where that really comes into play?
M	What do you on breakpoints this tournament that just seems you're impossible to break? Today was key in the first set at 15-40 when Mardy was serving 3-5 and he hit a serve like right at you.
M	It looks as though when you're in those pressure situations you're able to find another gear and sort of just get an extra level. What is that? Is it focus and concentration kicks in a little bit more?
M	You said something in Portuguese. You tried to talk about Brazil. Are you planning to go there and maybe learn some soccer with Guga?
M	You looked at a translation?
M	Brad Gilbert forgot ask you the big question. You're going to watch from your hotel, but who do you think will win and who do you want to win?
M	You have an edge on Rafa on hardcourt, I think; not with Roger. If you're going to get Rafa, I guess you prefer a hardcourt; is that right?
M	Do you think it was good to get a day match in before a final that's going to be at lunchtime just to get a sense...
M	You've been playing with a strap on your knee for a while. Any concern there? Seemed like one game you might have tweaked it a little bit.
M	Have you been following the record, your match records that you've been creeping up on guys. Are you looking at this at all? How important is it for you?
M	You've been pressing the top of the rankings for years. A few years ago I remember you going like this a lot. (Holding up index finger.) It was when Federer was kind of in a slump. Do you feel that...
M	You were like saying No.1 or whatever this gesture meant after you would win a match.
M	It's not true?
M	Anyway, do you feel like this is your time or do you have any sense of invincibility now?
F	How did you get through that last game?
F	Who are you?
F	Do you feel like you can beat anyone at this point? You take out a No.1, you take out a former No.1, and you did you it in championship style. Confidence?
F	Was the rain delay helpful for you? Because you had a really slow start.
F	You put a lot of emphasis on your game plan yesterday. Today did you have a plan going in?
F	Did you discuss a new strategy as a result with your coach during the rain delay?
F	Do you sense that there is a lot of opportunity on the WTA side these days? You have a No.1 who has not won a Grand Slam event; you have a couple of champions struggling, like Maria Sharapova. Is there kind of an open field for some of you other girls who might want to take initiative and go forward?
F	There was also a change of style, you think, and we had a generation that was sort of quite defensive. You mentioned Kvitova, yourself, attacking players.
F	Are you ready to beat another former No.1, if Sharapova wins?
F	Do you have a game plan against Maria?
F	Speaking of doubles, are you watching your partner's progress here?
F	When you say you always believed in yourself, how precise was the belief? You believed you could reach the top? You had a specific goal or just believed you could make it on the tour?
F	Who was the most difficult to beat her? Wozniacki or Jankovic?
F	Are you ready to win this tournament?
F	When you talk about your fitness, how much time do you put into your fitness as opposed to your on-court stroke work and details, technical...
F	What kind of running? Distance or...
F	For those that are getting to know you, can you talk a little bit more about your celebration dance at the end?
M	Good win. I guess you really needed this week. Struggled a bit and looks like you're getting your confidence back out there?
M	I guess with Andy out early, surprising everyone, you get the old story, Oh, American tennis is dead. Meanwhile, Mardy is having a fine resurgence. Obviously you're right there. Does that bother you, hearing all that stuff?
M	How about you?
M	You were probably expecting to play the other Andy in this round. What was your reaction to that?
M	Related to what you said earlier, I read that you said something about that you were not going to focus on Grand Slams but just on what you needed to do to become a better player. What prompted that? What was the point that you kind of made that shift, and how that's been going?
M	So I know you had a disappointing round at Delray Beach. Do you regroup after that?
M	With you and Kevin Anderson playing in the next round, we'll have two former college stars meeting in the fourth round. What's that like for you?
M	Why is it good?
M	I think you're three wins, one loss against him in the pros, but in college was it the same way?
M	That was '07?
M	The other thing is the tall angle. Is that something that fans seem to enjoy or people talk about a lot?
M	Does it change it a little bit for you because you're used to people being somewhat smaller as far as strategy?
M	Do you feel like today was the best you played this season?
M	Do you have you VCU and Butler in the Final Four?
M	Who did you have?
M	Considering that you played so much tennis, is it helpful that tonight's match was so short?
M	How did you feel out there?
M	When you're playing like this, are you just chomping at the bit to get back out there as quickly as possible? Is it hard to wait between matches?
M	How much do you think you'll have to rely on your net game this tournament?
M	How much do you think you'll have to rely on coming to the net in this tournament?
M	Considering the fact that you've been really unbeatable this year, does playing so well bring another level of pressure to maintain that high level of play?
M	You've got James next; is that right?
M	Your thoughts about that matchup?
M	You talked about confidence. Andy at the moment has no confidence, I guess. Can you feel for him? Do you understand what he's going through at the moment?
M	What are you going to do in doubles tomorrow to cheer him up?
M	How does it come to pick Andy as a partner for doubles? You were both practicing doubles to be better later?
M	Would you like to see more top guys play doubles? Do you think it's good for the game?
M	You were this week in my country, in Colombia. How did you enjoy that experience?
F	How much did you feel that that match was on your racquet?
F	Then just three early breaks in all the sets, that was tough to overcome?
F	Well, in all three you were down a break pretty early.
F	Did you feel like you made some progress, at least? You won a set today. You got much closer than you have in the past.
F	Could you assess your season now that it's done, please.
F	Is it harder to play against a left-handed opponent for you?
F	What's next for you, sort of the next couple of months?
F	With what's happening the last few months, would you almost want the season to continue or are you pretty much ready for that break?
F	If Petra wins tomorrow, she's going to be No.2, and she'll be pretty close to Caroline going into the new year. Could you just compare and sort of contrast their respective games from a player's perspective?
F	Of the maybe under 23 players that are out there right now, does she look to you, Petra, like the one with the skill? She can be erratic and she plays a high-risk game, but does she look like she has the skills that can really consolidate and be a solid No.1 player?
F	The men are still talking about the length of their season. You were saying you feel pretty good at this stage. Do you feel that's a sign that the women have got it just about right in terms of length of the year?
F	But looking back, do you think it was a tough decision for the women to make to cut the year?
F	You've obviously improved a lot in the course of the season. Is there any part of your game you're going to look at during the offseason to improve even more?
F	What are you expecting when you get back? You only had that four or five days after the US Open. Are you going to be bombarded with attention, do you think?
F	What will you do in your down time? Sit up in your house and what else?
F	Are you planning to make sightseeing next couple of days? Are you excited to come back in next year in Istanbul?
F	Your flight is not with Qantas, is it?
F	Could we have your view about the match you just played?
F	Your view, your thoughts about the match you just finished.
F	Well done. Great game. What do you think about the atmosphere in Istanbul and the audience of Turkish tennis game?
F	(Through translation.) What was the most important part of the match which was a crucial turning point for you?
F	I'm not sure, but I think one set will be enough for you advancing for semifinals tomorrow. What do you think about the game tomorrow?
F	(Through translation.) How is the injury on your shoulder?
F	That was a battle out there, huh?
F	Is that becoming more of a trademark of yours, just being able to put the past behind you, fighting it and gutting it out?
F	What was your dad telling you? He came out several times.
F	So dictate more?
F	Stacey yesterday spoke a little bit about the idea of the women's tournament and the men's year-ender all taking place at the same time possibly in the future. What would you think about that? Would you support that? Or do you think the women should stay separate?
F	You don't think it would detract from the women's tour at all?
F	So how would you compare this venue to Doha where you've also played? Can you describe how it's different or not?
F	The court surface, it's I guess kind of slow or sticky? How would you describe it?
F	In your mind, what was the difference in the match today? Obviously you came back in the third set. What was the key to the match today, the win?
F	She jumped on you pretty early there. Was that a big experience for you, just being in your biggest match?
F	You talked about the people and the lights. Were you happy when you heard that you would be playing on Grandstand instead of Ashe?
F	You said there was nothing you could do. I mean, the men players stepped up and talked to the USTA and got a day off. Do you think the women need to step up?
F	What's next for you now that you've reached a semifinal at the slam? What are your goals for the rest of the year?
F	How do you know if this is one good run for you or the beginning of you stepping up and becoming more of a challenger?
F	What are your expectations now in terms of challenging next year? What do you think you're capable of?
F	What would you say is either your best surface or your favorite surface?
F	Did you have family here with you?
F	I saw someone with a big bouquet of roses. Were those for you?
F	Someone supporting you. They had roses. For you?
F	There were some who were wondering if you were being paid by the hour in the third and fourth, round but today it must have been a relief just to get that match over.
F	Vera has been playing some great tennis. Obviously it shows in her ranking. You have dominated her the last eight times that you've played her. What is it about the way you two match up that enables you to get the best of her consistently?
F	She said that she felt that you felt comfortable against her because of the way she plays her game. Is that so?
F	Obviously the job is not done yet. What does it mean to you? What does it feel like to be in the semis of the Open for the first time and the first Australian Queenslander since Wendy in '84?
F	Can you talk a little bit about the rain delay and what you did and what mentally you had to do to stay focused.
F	Rafa came in earlier today and said that he felt that the players are not considered more in the decision-making here at the US Open. Do you have any thoughts on that?
F	Do you think it's also a situation with the way the scheduling is done with this tournament, in that you've got first round across three days rather than two at most slams -- French starts on a Sunday, anyway.
F	And then it's more evenly spread, so you probably would have had the quarters done by now.
F	What are your thoughts on that?
F	How intense is that playing day after day after day? Usually just semis and finals, but now you have quarters, semis, finals. I guess it's less of an adjustment for the women because you probably do this during the year. Is very intense to do it at a slam?
F	Can you look ahead to first playing Kerber and then separately to playing Pennetta?
F	You said after beating Kirilenko that you felt more pumped than ever in your life. How did you feel today?
F	I think you played Flavia in Fed Cup. Is that the last time you played?
F	Can you talk about how you're feeling about your game now compared to then?
F	Is this some of the best tennis you've played since your run at the French?
F	That run you went on at the end of the first set and then the first two games in the second, was that almost as close as it gets to perfect, 12 straight points in a row?
F	With the anniversary of 9/11 coming up, can you talk a little bit about your memories that you have and where you were and what that experience was like for you?
M	You're one of the few players wearing sunglasses. Is that for vision correction or a fashion statement?
M	Have you been watching that tiebreaker? They're tiring themselves out for the next match they're gonna have to play.
M	Yeah.
M	How often do you two practice together?
M	Is there a plan for you two to play doubles in the Olympics?
M	How special is this for you to get to a quarterfinals of a Grand Slam in singles?
M	If you happen to play Novak, would your familiarity with each other make it harder or easier on this stage?
M	What's your most memorable match against Novak?
M	About today's match, I just wanted to ask you, looked like you guys were very, very even for the first three sets. What happened in the fourth set that led you to pull away? What do you think was working for you today?
M	You had the injury timeout. How is your leg? How are you feeling?
M	As well as you know him, are you as astonished as the rest of us as to what he has actually achieved this year?
M	Ana Ivanovic was right here talking about Novak's importance now in your country. How big would it be for you to beat Novak - this year, I mean?
M	Talking about wearing the glasses, most athletes who wear contacts have the laser surgery. Is that something that...
M	I'm writing about your racquet, and I wondered, what's the benefit and the challenge of working with a smaller brand? How did you hook up with them?
M	At this level, how much of the game is mental? How would you assess your mental strength?
M	If you play Novak, the fans in Serbia are watching. Who do you think they'll be cheering for?
M	We've been bothering you with what's been wrong with American tennis. We have four Americans making it to the second week for the first time since 2003. Tell us what's right about American tennis?
M	Speaking of positive, after the match you were so positive with the fans. Did you get that vibe coming in early in the match or did something grow as the match went on?
M	I presume you heard about what happened to Rafa in this room a little while ago. Could you talk about the physical tolls on athletes.
M	The worst case of your cramps?
M	It's just that he's sitting there and next he's sliding out of sight.
M	You've always been an exceptional baseline player. What has changed now that makes you become more aggressive and really attack the net?
M	Donald Young seems pretty confident. Have you had a chance to watch him? What's different about his game now?
M	As many matches as you've played in Ashe, have you figured out certain conditions there that could be to your advantage?
M	Can I ask you this?
M	Seemed to be a southwest wind. Is it the same breeze on the court? Are you waiting for the next player to come in who doesn't know something?
M	You talk about three, four weeks ago you were hurt and you didn't know. As you progress, are you feeling, okay, I'll be there, or are you still doubtful until the tournament starts?
M	We know how tough David Ferrer can be. Are you going to try to do some things differently against him? What are your thoughts on that matchup?
M	Talking about your progression coming back from injury, once you're in this tournament, is there sort of a work-in-progress element to it, or once the tournament begins you are what you are at that point?
M	Can you talk about Ferrer's return of serve? Is that a particular strength of his?
M	How do you deal with Nebraska going to the Big Ten?
M	16
M	How different is the occasion playing him here? Obviously in Austin, total fan support. You'll have a lot of support here. Different feeling?
F	You said before the match that you had to go out and you had to play your game. How do you feel you did overall today?
F	What did you improve on? I know you faced each other at the Aussie Open; I know that was a little more lopsided. What did you improve on today?
F	What was go her game? Aggressiveness? Strength?
F	Interesting to hear you say that she was more aggressive, because, you know, people say she's not aggressive.
F	You had her on the ropes several times on her serve. You broke her three times, but it could have been a lot more.
F	Obviously whenever there is a No.1 player in tennis -- I don't know, going back to Tomas Muster or whoever -- who hasn't won a slam. There's always comments and questions, whether it's a legitimate No.1. Now, we all know Caroline also had trouble even reaching finals. What are your thoughts about that frame of mind, that it's not a real No.1?
F	With all due respect, I was asking you what your thoughts were on that mindset.
F	How did you feel physically? You have been playing a lot of tennis the last couple days, both the singles and doubles. Did you feel fatigued?
F	You were training largely on clay. Are you still training primarily on clay?
F	Just talk about that. Is it a plus even coming to a hard court or grass court tournament?
F	With women's doubles, you and your partner, you take on in the next round a couple of American wildcards. Are you looking forward to playing them? Overall, with American support, how do you feel the crowd has been the last couple days for you?
F	Jessica Pegula and Tara Townsend.
F	They're wildcards.
M	How did you turn that match around?
M	What do you put it down to, that slow start?
M	Was his injury a turning point as well, do you think?
M	Seemed almost bemused at the end of the match.
M	Yes. Net cord, laughing. Quite unusual.
M	Do you take confidence knowing you came back from two sets down a few times before?
M	What was going through your mind in those first two sets?
M	Do you maybe feel a particular pressure here because of what's happened the last two years?
M	You seemed really relieved moments after the match.
M	The lights came on about halfway through the final set. The sun was very low in the sky. That's about the time that the 13-game streak came to an end. Did that affect you at all?
M	Coming through a match like that, fighting back, did it sort of give you a spur for the next match, a bit of a lift?
M	Lpez obviously somebody you played a few times before, good record.
M	How are you going to celebrate tonight?
M	Do you find the New York crowd really makes a difference to you? They really seem to lift you at the end and support you.
M	Do you think it's beneficial early when you can get through a match like this?
M	You were certainly on cruise control today? Doing very well.
M	Is that why you were nervous when you came in? The commentator said you were nervous.
M	Yeah, you did. Was this because it's the first encounter with Sela?
M	Any sense of the court playing any different during the day than it was at night during the night?
M	What was your reaction when you heard the news about Venus Williams and what are your thoughts about her career in general?
M	When you hear about other players missing slams, in the middle or at any point, what sort of perspective does that give you on how you've been so fortunate and durable to not just play, but do well in slams for so long?
M	Have you had a chance to read Rafa's book?
M	Are you comfortable with the level of latitude that officials give players, or do you think it's maybe gotten too strict?
M	Yeah.
M	On that subject, would you be surprised to learn only half of the top umpires in the game are actually officiating at this championship and half have stayed away?
M	A little bit to do with money, conditions, unhappiness with the tournament. There's no Graf, Maria, the people you'd see week in and week out.
M	Can you give us your thoughts on your next round? Obviously Marin and Bernard are going to be playing this afternoon.
M	What do you think of Bernard's style? It's quite sort of unusual, I guess, in some ways.
M	Although you cruised in straight sets, do you feel he was out of sorts or out of character today?
M	When you have a bad day, and you don't have many bad days...
M	But when you come home to the twins, do they put things in perspective to you?
F	Did you ever get those Christian Louboutins you were talking about?
F	Can you describe the tiebreak, what your mindset was in that? Was there a key point or two you remember?
F	Did you let down in the second set or did she play better?
F	What are your expectations of yourself today?
F	It seems like you were pretty carefree and it was almost like gravy for you at this point.
F	Is your mom always like that?
F	You were noticing where your mother and brother were during the match?
F	Did you ask him what he was doing?
F	Do all you American teenagers pay attention to what the others are doing? Do you look at the draw, check their scores?
F	What about Madison?
F	How did you handle what happened in Paris?
F	Did you feel like you handled it the right way and built upon it?
F	Here or there?
F	Does it change your preparation? When you feel any kind of anxiety, all that stuff coming on, since you've been through it again, do you know what to do?
F	In Paris, were you in a similar situation?
F	Is the gold nail polish, does that mean anything?
F	How do you deal with the fumes?
F	Are you a little Serena in training here?
F	Are you in high school now?
F	You graduated?
F	Are you thinking about that?
F	You must have some mixed emotions on perhaps the biggest day of your life, playing so well and not winning.
F	How close do you think you came to pulling it off then?
F	You obviously had a set way you wanted to play. You did execute it pretty well. How difficult is it to sustain that level again and again against someone who hits the ball like Sharapova?
F	When you're out there, you're very quiet returning shots. Your opponent was screaming. Was it hard to concentrate?
F	Was that because when somebody is making such a lot of noise you find yourself being drawn into it?
F	When you watch Maria as a spectator on the television, is the noise apparent to you?
F	You got a pretty good standing ovation when you left. What was the atmosphere like? How do you feel you handled it?
F	There didn't appear to be a trace of nerves. Did you sleep well last night?
F	Have you ever been on court with Sharapova before, at Bollettieri's, for example?
F	She missed quite a few shots today, much to do with the fact you were playing so well. In terms of weight of shot, does she hit the ball as hard as anyone you've faced?
F	What about the court? Did you ever look up and realize the enormity of it at all?
F	What do you think you need to do, Heather - you've made impressive progress this year - to keep on that trajectory? What parts of your game do you need to improve?
F	Did you talk to Laura about playing Sharapova since she had the experience at Wimbledon?
F	Is there a kind of rivalry between you and Laura at the moment?
F	A rivalry.
F	How far do you think you'll go in the rankings, say, in the next year or so?
F	Where do you play next?
F	What's the plan after that?
M	Talk a little bit about your serve in the second set. Both you guys got broken three times. What was the problem there?
M	Were you struggling with your heel again?
M	When you challenged on Andy's first match point or whatever that was, did you expect that to...
M	You guys walked to the net and were ready to shake hands.
M	Did you find that that affected you after that?
M	In the first set, you dove and went down and scraped yourself up a little bit; he started to dropshot you and then you started to dropshot him. Take me through that period of the match.
M	You had a couple of 20-plus-shot rallies. I would imagine that's not part of your game plan on playing Andy.
M	What was your game plan?
M	When Andy's on the other side grabbing his hamstring between points acting injured, but the plays fantastic side-to-side shots, how does that affect you?
M	Is it safe to say that you've never played as well as you would have liked at the US Open? If so, is it a combination of the expectations and just being at the end of a long haul? How do you explain?
M	What positives do you take out of a match like this?
M	Players talk about peaking at the right time, especially this time of year when there are two big tournaments and then going into the slam. How can you control the pace of the level of your tennis?
M	You said that you fell in love with the US Open in 2008.
M	How would you describe your feelings to it then before 2008?
M	The format of Davis Cup gets bashed quite a bit, and players like you say it's a thrill to represent your country. Some players say it's the highlight of their career. Can you tell me what Davis Cup means to you?
M	Did the last couple weeks sort of catch up a little bit today? You beat Rafa yesterday, and you wake up and you're in a game like this.
M	How do you prepare for the attention that you're going to get at the Open being the new old face of American tennis at the American major?
M	Can I ask a follow on that? Were there times when Andy was just at the height of his popularity and just the craziness, the hubbub...
M	That comes to mind.
M	Stay away from them. What would you think to yourself as you're watching all that go on?
M	Coming into this match, you had won the last three encounters with Andy. Is there anything that you can point to that you were not able to do today or that he did better that caused the outcome today?
M	You came back from two Love-40s in the second set. Wondering, serving at Love-40, what are you looking to do differently that you hadn't been able to do?
M	Are you ever able to take a step back and think that in this era of Roger and Rafa and with what Novak is doing now that you're part of what may be looked upon in the future as the Golden Age of tennis? Are you ever able to reflect on that, or are you just too hot in the moment?
F	Congratulations on your win.
F	You seem to have very varied head-to-heads with certain players. With certain players you always do well, Li, for example. Is there something about your game that you think makes some players unable to deal with it ever?
F	Talk a little bit about the difference between the second and third set there and how Li was able to come back and how you settled yourself. Looked like you were getting frustrated on the court in the second.
F	Having played all the way to the final last week, are you glad to have gotten a break yesterday with Serena pulling out?
F	I know you hadn't been happy with the beginning of your 2011. What do you think you were able to change to get going the last couple weeks?
F	Is your confidence much higher now?
F	Li Na was saying she was finding it a bit demoralizing against your serve. Obviously your serve is a key component of your game. Do you ever get that sense when you're serving against somebody, that they have to work so hard to try and even get a point off your serve, and then you fire an ace? Do you get a sense it's demoralizing to them body language-wise?
F	With Serena pulling out and a bunch of other people already exiting the tournament, this week is very wide open. What would winning this title mean to you if you were able to?
F	You're one of the few players that doesn't use on-court coaching at all.
F	What's the rationale behind that?
F	Sometimes it's a distraction. Do you think it can disturb you, your focus?
F	You think that the reason, one of the reasons that older players have been doing well in Grand Slams compared to the younger generation, is that younger generations came up during this era when on-court coaching was allowed?
F	You think having younger players call their coaches during tournaments slows their development?
F	It's wide open here this week, and also wide open for New York. Do you think it's a good opportunity for to you really make a push?
M	How are you feeling? You're going to be the top-rated American going into the US Open. Is that a lot of pressure to play in the United States being the top-rated American?
M	And looking back, what has been your improvement over the last year or so that's brought you all the way to where you are?
M	I know you never expect things to be easy, but to start the tournament like that coming off Montral, could you have asked for anything better?
M	You ever leave the court wishing for a little more?
M	You talked last week about the importance of having belief in big matches.
M	Did you still get something from the final even though you lost it?
M	Davydenko is historically such a good returner of serve. He only had 9%, I think, service points returned.
M	Was that you? Was that him? A combination?
M	He won the toss and elected to serve, which is kind of like a football team with a great defense electing to put its offense on the field. Were you surprised by that?
M	Then you broke him at love.
M	Few years ago you would have been sort of the dangerous player in the early rounds; now you're the seed and expected to win. Talk about learning to handle the challenge of those early matches.
M	You said the other night that because of last week you could play a little more freely this week. What does that mean? You try new things?
M	Could you just briefly address what went into your decision to withdraw from Winston-Salem?
M	Can you just talk about signing up to play every tournament in summer and what the thinking was.
M	Just changing topics slightly, it's going to be the tenth anniversary of September 11th. Talk about your memories of that day, where you were.
M	How does it feel to still be here at this stage of Wimbledon?
M	You've achieved some firsts now for you: No.1, first Wimbledon final. Now you have another that you're going to try to achieve: beating Rafael Nadal in a Grand Slam. Can you describe that challenge and how the other ones may have helped you prepare for this one?
M	What have you proven to yourself about the mental side of the game with what you've achieved in this half year?
M	Yesterday Andy Murray at the start of the second set had one point which was very crucial that he missed. Seemed to let it affect him for a while. What do you do to make sure if you make one mistake that it's not the start of more?
M	Do you feel able to do that now? Do you think that's something you've put into your game this year?
M	You've got the No.1 ranking. Do you feel you need to beat Rafa in a slam tomorrow just to prove to everyone you are the No.1?
M	Will you be doing anything special to prepare yourself for Sunday?
M	At the beginning of the tournament a lot of the experts and pundits were tipping either Rafa or Roger, talking a lot about Andy Murray, even though you had been the form player of the season so far. Do you feel you've got the respect for what you've achieved so far this season?
M	We've been quite carried away in this country about Liam Broady. You have a younger brother playing at a high standard. Have you brought him over just to show him what a Grand Slam is like? Can you talk a little bit about him?
M	How would you best describe Nadal the player and Nadal the person?
M	You say he's always fair play. He does have a reputation for slowing the game down, particularly when he's in a difficult situation. What's your take on that? If he does that tomorrow, how will you deal with it?
M	Your reaction yesterday was very expressive. Winning this title, would this mean more to you than anything else you've ever achieved?
M	Because it's Wimbledon?
M	What are your immediate reflections on that?
M	Do you feel like you lost it or he won it?
M	Were you starting to believe you could win at that point, 3-1 in the third?
M	When you say, "if I was a little bit smarter," what do you think you should have done differently?
M	At the end of the first set you looked pretty tired, but then you came good. Can you tell us physically sort of the peaks and troughs during the match how you went.
M	You mentioned getting into the top 80 as the end-of-year goal. You're ahead of schedule. What do you think is possible after what you've been able to do here?
M	The crowd started getting behind you in that second set. Describe what it was like out there. Could you feel the momentum shifting back to you? What's it like playing at Wimbledon for a player like yourself?
M	Do you feel like you really belong now with this result you've had?
M	What do you think you have more to improve, which specific skills?
M	The Olympics here next year will be looking a bit more attractive than a few weeks ago.
M	How difficult do you think it is for your dad sometimes to stop coaching you and just be your dad, just be your parent?
M	You have other people involved. Is it maybe a bit of a transition the next two or three years as you mature yourself that your old man won't be on tour as much with you?
M	When you say, " slip out," you mean find another coach to take you to another level?
M	You're obviously one of the younger players here at the tournament, the youngest, I think. You were the youngest to reach the quarterfinals since Boris Becker. If you'd won today, there would have only been two younger players than you, and that's Becker and John McEnroe. What are your thoughts being compared in that same light as those great players of previous years?
M	Did Goran say anything to you before or after the match that you'll take away with you?
M	Did you think you had a quarterfinal in you?
M	You think you're that far ahead of schedule in results?
M	With the sort of game you've got, do you think you can be a good player on clay or...
M	You talk about maturing physically. Do you think your game will change? Seeing you for the first time, I'll admit, you've got this counter-puncher's game and you take the pace off the ball. You had Novak guessing throughout today. Do you think when you have more power you'll be tempted to change that game or you'll stick to the thoughtful approach you bring to it?
M	A few years ago you were playing with some Italian players like Giacomo Miccini. Sometimes you were losing; sometimes you were winning. Do you ever think, I'm lucky, I made it and the others didn't? Is it just a matter of luck, of strength? What are the reasons why someone is capable to do it and someone is not? It's just talent or something else?
M	Where do you go?
M	What has your Wimbledon experience taught you about yourself?
M	You've seen everyone close up. Who is your tip to win the tournament now?
M	Any chance you'll hit with Novak before his semi?
M	Why are you going to Monte-Carlo?
F	It appeared you ran out of gas in the third set. What happened?
F	What is it like facing her serve, and is it the best serve on the women's tour?
F	Do you feel it would have been any different with the roof open?
F	How difficult was it to concentrate when you had the thunder, the rain so loud? The umpire had to shout at some point to be heard.
F	How important is it to hear the sound in a match? Have you ever played in a situation like this where there was so much noise from the elements?
F	Do you feel like the amount she used the dropshot in the match, which was unusually high, did that play a part in you losing energy a little bit as the match wore on?
F	You said you hate even losing a game of Monopoly to your brother. How will you be tonight? What is your mood going to be tonight?
F	Do you get upset when people say the women's game doesn't have many stars, because that was an excellent game? Do you feel there's a lot of talent in the women's gave perhaps not being recognized at the moment?
F	During your run to the final here a while back, you had that great win over Justine; the other day you beat Serena. How would you compare those two wins? Which was more special?
F	You talk about running out of gas. You were always on the moving from place to place and whacking your racquet. Did that slow you down or was that pumping yourself up?
F	After Serena yesterday, did you see yourself as going all the way to the finals?
F	Do you think Sabine's game plan was in a certain way in that direction, exhausting you, making you run, making you move a lot on the court?
M	How does it feel to be the last American standing?
M	What are your thoughts on being this far along in the tournament right now and what is your level of excitement about it?
M	You look at your results on grass recently and how you feel about it, do you think, Why did it take me this long?
M	You seem real measured, almost mellow. Do you feel like screaming like crazy inside?
M	If I'm not mistaken, you've only been broken once in your serve in four rounds. Did you see that coming?
M	Against him though today I guess returning somewhat important.
M	How does it feel to be the Lone Ranger?
M	Not to get personal, but John McEnroe said that somehow Andy's marriage might be a distraction or detrimental. In the past you said your relationship and marriage has been a real help. Can you just talk about that as a factor in your career.
M	Some guys are good at playing someone for the first time. Do you feel like you're a good first-meeting player or not in your career?
M	Looking forward, what would be the best conditions for you come Wednesday?
M	In 2003 you were the only one who took a set off of Federer when he won the tournament. Many years have been passed.
M	Do you still remember that?
M	As someone who follows the Lakers and NBA, is it sort of odd to see Sasha standing around as part of an entourage here?
M	He seems to be a magnet. People from all countries are coming up and slapping his back and talking to him. Is that what you're talking about?
M	When you were Roddick's teammate in high school, what kind of game did you bring on the court?
M	Did you hear from Andy or any of the other guys before your match?
M	You heard from all those guys?
M	Sounds like Rafa is not too interested in visiting Austin, Texas.
M	Do you think it's a tough decision for him, because he comes from a country where tennis matters a lot and they're used to him playing?
M	If Rafa does come through, how do you get in a mindset against a guy you've never beaten on a really big stage?
M	Most people like him. He's considered to be a good guy. Ten slams and all that. But there is criticism that he tends to take too much time on court. Talk about your feelings with that.
M	You've been to this stage before in a slam, but not here. Have you learned anything from past experiences that might help you this week, do you think?
M	Talk about when you're playing later in the day and everywhere you look upsets seem to be brewing, many of which come to pass. How aware are you of that? What does that do for you as you're waiting?
M	You spoke briefly about the mental challenge in facing Nadal. From a strictly tactical and style point of view, what to you is the biggest challenge for your game against his? He just won the third set.
M	What was the injury?
M	Did it affect your performance at all?
M	You obviously played Roger a lot over the years. Can you compare the way he's playing now to the way he was playing three or four years ago?
M	So do you think it's more that maybe Nadal and Djokovic have improved rather than him getting worse?
M	And just to come back to you, you've had a lot of injuries recently. How tough is it to keep coming back from that over and over again?
M	It must have been one of the more difficult situations to sleep on that particular score. I just wondered how hard it was and how you come back out again to that situation.
M	Did you sleep last night? Seems without saying so, seemed like the result was almost predetermined. So in a way, is that more relaxing?
M	You were one of the last two Americans. Now there's just one. Is that a little bit sad, too, in this?
M	Next round it's Xavier Malisse. What do you know about him? What do you expect?
M	Chennai.
M	Is it 50/50?
M	Why haven't you played since Rome?
M	And you are 100% okay?
F	How tired are you in your mind?
F	Can you tell us what went wrong.
F	The wrong result. You almost had it, didn't you?
F	Was your mental strength there, determination, your famous drive?
F	Has she got one of the best serves you've faced? Your coach said to me, She serves like a man.
F	How different was it for you coming in here as the French Open champion for the first time, as a Grand Slam winner, obviously a lot more attention from China? Was that a difference here playing at Wimbledon?
F	Did the fact that your husband left halfway through the second set, did that affect you?
F	Years from now, back in China, when you are an old woman...
F	Years from now, your friends say to you, How was your trip to Europe in 2011, what will you say to them?
F	What are you looking forward to at this moment?
F	And tomorrow?
F	You're going back to China?
F	What greeting do you want to have when you get there?
F	What message are you taking back to China?
F	In this country we get very excited every time Andy Murray plays at Wimbledon. Britain is a country of 60 million people. Can you tell us what it is like to carry the hopes of 700 million people back in China?
F	What lesson do you want the children of China to take from your adventures over the last weeks and months?
F	There's a positive message for them, isn't there?
F	Do you expect a good reception when you go back to the airport?
F	Are there lots more Grand Slam champions to come from China? Will you be the standard bearer for a long procession of Chinese champions from now on?
F	Will there be lots more Grand Slam champions out of China in tennis now, do you think?
F	Why is there such a difference between the men and the Chinese women?
F	What's the problem with the men? Lazy?
F	Are you telling the Chinese men to work harder?
F	What do you like to do when you're not playing tennis? Do you like fashion? What do you like to do?
F	But do you like shopping, going to theater, see movie?
F	What do you like to shop?
F	How did your Coach Mortensen help you the most, your coach?
F	Will you continue to work with him or don't you know?
F	When you wake up at 3:00 in the morning and you remember this match today, are there going to be any moments where you think, If only I'd done that?
F	I hope you find your husband.
M	You must be very pleased with how you played today.
M	Was that because he started playing better or do you think your level dropped a little bit?
M	Did you feel any difference in the conditions, playing under the roof?
M	In Paris you got to renew your rivalry with Roger in a final for the first time in a while. What else is going on this year is it seems some people think there's another rivalry emerging for you with Novak Djokovic who defeated you four times this year. Do you think this rivalry thing is something that players think about or something that just journalists think about?
M	The difference with Roger, though, was that you were deemed to be in the ascendancy. If you look on the Wimbledon website today, the most popular story is you being toppled as No.1 if you don't win this tournament and that you may be a man in decline. Do you feel like a man in decline?
M	Yes.
M	Did it feel slightly odd today to be playing indoors with a roof on when everyone else was playing outdoors in sunshine?
M	How do you look at Michael Laudrup's first seen in Mallorca?
M	Did you get nervous in the end?
M	You played Muller a few years ago in the second round and lost. You probably didn't expect to be playing him perhaps in the third round. What is your view of Muller, your memories of that match? How have you changed in your game and your belief in yourself since then?
M	In your spare time when you go home, are you still cooking in the evening to relax?
M	What's your specialty?
M	Are you as good a cook as you are a tennis player?
M	First win at Wimbledon, right, over a former No.3 in the world. Must be excited.
M	Did you think he might be a bit susceptible on grass? He hasn't got the best record at Wimbledon.
M	Were you happy with how you came back from dropping all those break points in the first set, and the set points as well? You had chances, didn't you?
M	How do you compare that form in your match to the Rafa match in Australia?
M	Happy with your playing schedule? In the lead-up to the French you maybe weren't playing as much as you could have been.
M	Does your game really suit grass, though?
M	Why in particular? Is it because you hit a bit flatter?
M	You're pretty happy overall with your serving game today? It was pretty strong?
M	The advantage of beating a seeded player, of course, is you don't get one in the next round. Have you had a look forward in the draw yet?
M	What does that studying involve? Do you get a DVD of it?
M	It's nice to avoid a big name though, I suppose, though, isn't it? Nice to have that out of the way?
M	You're still the youngest guy in the tournament. You've been around on tour for a while. Do you still feel like the young guy?
M	I think you were quoted as saying your goal is top 80; is that right? Are you going to have to revise that depending on this tournament?
M	It's very early, your first match in the tournament. But this is the first Wimbledon since you were a teenager that people aren't expecting necessarily a Federer/Nadal final. One of the stories of this year is you've played yourself into that rivalry. How do you think about that? You're friends with Rafa. How does that change your approach, if it does?
M	You only dropped 11 points on serve. Can you ever remember being so dominant on serve in a five-set match?
M	Were you pleased how quickly you adapted to the win?
M	How much would you wish that Caroline Wozniacki was here to ask the questions instead of us?
M	Better questions.
M	Following her question, you have one winning streak.
M	How do you relax yourself during the Wimbledon tournament? You play golf?
M	You looked like you had some strapping on your left knee. Is that just a precaution?
M	A little while ago you were the focus of all the talk in tennis. Today there's plenty of room to stretch out, not that much focus on you. Talk about this new stage. Do you enjoy having a breather, that not everyone is concentrating on you?
M	Tennis is a game of cycles and growth. Inside Novak Djokovic, does he feel that he's ready to win Wimbledon?
M	On the night that the streak ended, you went out to have some fun in Paris. You were even tweeting. Do you remember anything about that night? Looked like you were very happy.
M	Do you have any superstitions of any description before you go into a big tournament like this?
M	You've beaten Rafael Nadal four times in a final this year. I can't remember him losing four finals. How does that affect your interpersonal dynamic with him? When you're in the locker room with him, how does that change?
M	I wanted to ask you, what is it like to receive serve against Raonic?
M	Did it get any easier as the match continued?
M	Was it the biggest serve you've ever played? You've played Roddick.
M	Is Raonic different because he's so tall?
M	Was it difficult just getting to know at the last moment that you were going to play?
M	Did you know much about him?
M	What are your thoughts on that?
M	Would more matches help?
M	Do you think it's like the hamstring and it's hard for you to get going this year?
M	Fitnesswise where are you? 80% fit?
M	Is that the main thing you'll work on now before Wimbledon, or to find more rhythm on the grass?
M	Are you going to play somewhere next week?
M	You had an interview this week in which you discussed retirement. What made you decide to talk about...
M	Some players like Ljubicic said in advance it will be at a certain tournament. Do you think when the time comes, whether it's in five years or whatever, that's how you'll do it?
M	Do you find yourself now thinking more of what will be, when it happens, what you'll do?
M	Yeah.
M	You have had so much success here, and you've gone out first match this year. Would that encourage you to come back next year, to keep playing?
M	Are you going to still play the doubles?
F	So how were the conditions out there?
F	Is it difficult not to get frustrated?
F	Down a set and 4love. What happened?
F	How does it feel to be in a final of a big tournament like this?
F	You had a great Wimbledon. What is it about grass that an Austrian likes?
F	What does it do for the confidence, obviously ahead of such a big tournament like Wimbledon next week, as well. Puts you into such a big spotlight now.
F	Looks like you will be playing Angelique. What do you make of that?
F	How long have you been working with Andrei?
F	Not long, but what has he managed to help you with?
F	How did you link up with him?
F	What were your injuries?
F	You must be well pleased with that?
F	She's a an old campaigner. To beat someone like that on the grass court is a good feather in the cap?
F	What have you been doing on your serve? It seemed to be particularly well today.
F	Did momentum coming through qualifying really help?
F	Have you seen some of the other results today? There's quite a few upsets.
F	How do you feel? Do you get a special buzz as Wimbledon gets nearer? Do you kind of get swept up in it, excited with it?
F	Is it difficult perhaps to really get totally into the tournament when you can't go home? Usually when you're at a tournament you're at a hotel and totally immersed in the tournament.
F	Do you cook for your dogs?
F	You're going to be inside the top 100.
F	Well, according to your website, you are.
F	No?
F	Where would you, in your own rankings of matches and victories, where would you place today?
F	Much was made of your Wimbledon campaign, the match with Sharapova last year. How much of a different player do you feel you are 12 months on and the progress you've made?
F	Today was obviously not the result you wanted, but it's been a good tournament. Looking forwards to next week there will be more positive than negatives.
F	4:30 this morning is when you got to bed.
F	What happened in the four hours after the match?
F	Does it feel like the tournament in Melbourne is very open, like there could be eight, nine, ten women who could win it?
F	At the start of the week you said when you drew your sister you were obviously in the too happy about that. With the draw in Melbourne tomorrow, are you a bit nervous about what might happen?
F	If it does work out like that, what would be your reaction?
F	Rock, scissors, paper.
F	Did you think you would be so happy at Love4 down in the third set?
F	What's the most satisfying coming back like that when you've lost the last two firstround games you've had here and she beat you twice last year. What's the most satisfying about that win?
F	When Li Na was in here, she said one of your great attributes is just how you fight for every point, every situation. I imagine that held you in good stead today in the third set.
F	What makes you not give up, because at Love4 you could have maybe gone to Melbourne and had a week. What makes you keep fighting?
F	How big was that double fault in the game with the break point?
F	You were at 41, and then she double faulted to give you a break to get back to 42.
F	Did you sense that she was struggling because you were getting momentum back when her coach came on court?
F	Do you feel like the stars are aligning a little bit? You and Petra are 1 and 2. Whoever wins here will take the No.1 ranking. Do you feel like there is a lot riding on this tournament?
F	I wanted to ask you one more about Venus. She's pulled out of the Australian Open. I know you played doubles with her a couple years ago. She says she's coming back in February. Of course you want her to come back healthy.
F	If you at your best is ten out of ten, where are you at the moment?
M	How are you feeling physically?
M	Has this sunk in, the results, the magnitude of the match?
M	Has the results sunk in yet? How do you feel mentally as well as physically?
M	If the day before the championship someone would say you would play a fivehour53minute match in the final, would you have been completely surprised that you could even compete?
M	Did you feel at any time in the fifth set the match was in your control? Given that he had to play so long against Murray a couple nights ago, were you surprised that he could stay with you that long?
M	You always said that Roger is the greatest that ever played the game. How great now is Novak?
M	You have been a part of two of the real epic battles in tennis history, this and the 2008 Wimbledon final. Is that something that you're proud of or a reason why you think you...
M	Where does that rate? How tough was that? Was that the toughest match? Toughest game you have been involved in? Where does it rank?
M	Are you going to watch it again on videotape?
M	When you're in that match, did you ever look at the clock? Did you ever look at the clock during the match, at the time?
M	Definitely better entertainment than the last match, Andy.
M	Do you feel you're kind of climbing step by step heading towards the semifinal?
M	Five semifinals in a row. What does that mean to you? You're looking for consistency. You must be incredibly proud of that.
M	Today your opponent said he looks at you as kind of a role model. He likes to play the way you do. He said he likes your backhand and your intelligence on the court. Do you think you find any similarity between you and Kei in terms of playing style?
M	What kind of advice would you like to give him?
M	Do you put your first serving down to your neck only today, or how do you think it's been going throughout the whole tournament?
M	You played in quite different conditions for all of your matches. What were the conditions like today?
M	You haven't had to spend too much time on court. How are you feeling other than the neck? Are you feeling fresh for this stage of the tournament?
M	What have you been able to see of Novak and David? Can you give us a quick preview of the two of them?
M	Do you feel more relaxed at this Grand Slam than maybe previous Grand Slams? Does it feel different?
M	Do you think that will help you in the semifinal?
M	With the top four having been the same for so long, you being part of that, does it feel any different for you this time having Roger and Rafa finally on the same half?
M	Can you offer an opinion as to who might come through between Roger and Rafa?
M	Obviously last year the final loss was quite a shattering experience against Novak. If you were to play him again, how much confidence do you take into it knowing that you've subsequently beaten him last year?
F	You looked in control on the start of the match and suddenly it got tougher at the end of the second set. How were you feeling in the tiebreak?
F	Do you feel you were 100% after what happened last match?
F	Can you give us an idea about, say, the last 48 hours how much you had to do to get ready and whether it was a lot more complicated than other times you had to get yourself ready for a match?
F	Is there any ancient Belgian recipe or snake oil that you used, something that you swallowed or rubbed into it or something? (Laughing.)
F	When you hit that big forehand that took you to match point, you looked really relieved, almost emotional. What was going through your mind then when you got to those two match points? You hit that enormous forehand.
F	Can you explain lack of match practice, I guess, a little injured, where does that unbelievable belief come, the selfbelief come from?
F	Does that give you a sense of destiny what happened against Li a little bit when you saved four match points and win a match like that?
F	Does stress ever really go away in big matches? Completely where you're out there and you have zero stress at all?
F	Your ankle in the third set against Li and compared to the second set today, does it feel the same? Does it feel worse better now two days later?
F	Sometimes it's forgotten that after you first became No.1 it took you more than two years for you to actually win your first slam. Now Caroline has been going through it for a long time. She was actually No.1 a lot more weeks than you were. Can you kind of relate how tough it is for her to come out every single slam and not win it and people are saying, Oh, you're not a legitimate No.1?
F	She's never beaten players like yourself or Serena. Did you feel today, maybe especially in the end of the second set, that she's getting closer?
F	Each of the matches you've played so far when you're standing in the tunnel waiting to come out, is there ever a thought this could be the last time I'm coming out onto the court of the Australian Open?
F	Did you get a scan on the ankle? What is it exactly?
F	Few thoughts on Azarenka, semifinal match coming up?
M	Was that an injury you had at the start of the match or something you did during the match?
M	Did you think about pulling out before the match?
M	Is it embarrassing when you know you've got an injury? Obviously people on television wouldn't be aware. They can just see that you can't serve. Is that embarrassing when you're trapped in that situation?
M	When you decided to switch from representing Russia to Kazakhstan, can you explain what the situation was there? How did that come about?
M	Was it mainly the Federation or are their private interests in Kazakhstan who helped fund this, like corporate interests, very rich individuals?
M	As part of the arrangement, do you live there?
M	What do you think about the next round of Davis Cup with Spain?
F	Bad luck. How did Kim's injury affect you? How did it affect your game?
F	Can you say anything about how you played at the end? Because you nearly came back in the third set. You got very close.
F	Can you talk about the tiebreak? On the fourth match point she lobbed you, but you didn't really try and run for it, even though I think you may have been able to get to it.
F	Do you believe in the year of dragon? Do you think the year of dragon will be more auspicious for you?
F	Last year you had the same with Wickmayer in Dubai.
F	Is there an explanation for it?
F	Is it a matter of nerves?
F	Were you affected by the heat today?
F	In the tiebreak, at one point you seemed to take your finger to your mouth towards the crowd. Was someone in the crowd bothering during the tiebreak?
F	I thought I saw you on television do that.
F	What happened at the beginning of the third set? Was the loss of the tiebreaker and the match points still in your head?
F	Have you ever had a match where you had four match points that you didn't take?
F	Against Kim last year in Sydney, you turned 05, at 5Love down in the first set, you turned it around. Is it easier to play against an opponent when you're down, when you have nothing to lose anymore?
F	This the first Grand Slam of the year. The whole year is in front of you. Would you like to change your game against a particular opponent like Kim, or do you think you'll continue with the same strategy and same type of game?
F	What do you think you'll take away from the match today going forward?
F	Are you going to head back to China?
F	Did you think Kim was at her best level after a couple of games coming back after her injury?
M	You said earlier today or yesterday, regardless of his injuries in recent past, Hewitt knows how to win. Is that basically the summary of tonight?
M	Would you say experience played a part?
M	There's no way you can duplicate in practice what this experience is going to be like. What was it like compared to what you might have thought or hoped it would be like?
M	How did you feel playing with the Australian crowd? A lot of support for Lleyton out there.
M	The smash you lost that break on, would you hit to again? Is that normally what you do in that situation?
M	When you say you got a lot to learn from this, will you watch the video and analyze it?
M	Do you think an environment like this tonight is going to help you in things like Davis Cup?
M	You kept your cool pretty well when things were slipping away. Did you struggle to do that? Are you at the point now where that was all right?
F	How did you feel out there?
F	Did the score in the first set look easier than it actually was?
F	Do you think at all about the whole No.1 situation, or just not in your mind?
F	You seem to come in quite a few times during this match, more than we normally see you do. Are you starting to feel more comfortable at the net?
F	Change for more reach?
M	That obviously wasn't the easiest threeset match you've ever played. How did you see it pan out?
M	When you got that break in the third set, what went through your mind? Did you think you had it when you finally broke him?
M	Have you had much of Anderson before the match? Did you know much about him?
M	Overall, how do you feel gamewise in this tournament?
M	I feel sorry if I ask a question which is not related to this tournament. We are going to play Davis Cup in Australia versus you, and I saw that Rosol, which is your No.3 Czech in the rankings, lost 6Love 6Love, 62 with Petzschner. So just you and Stepanek can play Davis Cup. What do you expect there? I know it's a long time. I know everything you probably don't like to talk about Davis Cup, but do me a favor if you can.
M	What do you think about Ivan Lendl coaching Andy Murray?
M	Do you have much of a relationship with Ivan?
M	He said some other players have asked him to coach him. You're not one of those players who ever asked him to coach you?
M	Lendl comes from Ostrava, which is where you're going to play Davis Cup. There is a reason why Ostrava is sort of now capital of the Czech tennis, or is not true?
M	Why there?
M	How much do you like to play the Australian Open compared to the three other Grand Slams?
M	Don't you have one favorite, one that you will never miss if you can? And one instead you'd like to miss maybe?
M	You will not tell me the second part of the question, but...
M	Can you take us through your feelings.
M	What was going through your head after the second set?
M	A few breaks, too. Did they disrupt you at all? Had the trainer out a few times.
M	A bit of frustration, too?
M	Given how good the first two sets were, how poor the score was in the last two sets, do you treat the match as a net positive or a net disappointment?
M	Are there any specific points or shots that make this match turn around?
M	Do you feel like he mixed it up a bit?
M	He looked like he started to mix it up a little bit more from the third set.
M	Good learning curve? Good players do that in matches. Have you learned a bit about that?
M	You have mixed doubles with Casey now.
M	Do you have plans after the Australian?
M	Not much to get down about?
M	Just your thoughts on the match, what happened.
M	Were you having problems with your feet early on?
M	How much did the timeouts for cramping that he was getting distract you? You had a tournament referee out talking to him about that.
M	Was your frustration also partially due to the score at that point, that you were down two sets, do you think?
M	Is it a bit of a gray area for treatment for cramps? Is it clear to you and everyone else what the rules are there?
M	Is it something the tour needs to look at and try to remove that gray area?
M	Do you think they should maybe rule out the trainer if it's each player's requirement to be as fit as they can, should they rule it out and say...
M	Is there a way to stop it?
M	Should the impetus be on the trainer? If he's got cramps should they be allowed to say, I'm not going to treat you because you're cramping?
M	But that's not necessarily a delay, though, if it's in the changeovers?
M	You seem to be sort of uncharacteristically frustrated a lot in Australia this month. Do you think that's to do with fatigue from last year?
M	Just sort of ending this match, getting angry with the chair umpire, Yelling?
M	Or questioning him more than you normally do.
M	For the sake of the game and the longterm prosperity, are there a couple of things that you think are highest on the agenda for the players in terms of perhaps changing things? If you had your magic wand, what would you do?
M	Just as a longterm professional, what do you think can be done to enhance the game for as many players as possible?
M	Probably not the best time to ask it. I just wondered. It's early in the season, but it hasn't been a great start. Are you questioning at all your offseason preparation or confidence?
M	How would you describe your feeling about the match today?
M	Wind was tricky? Did you think you were aggressive enough?
M	You had the control of the game, of the match, except in the second set. What was the problem in the second set?
M	It's your first time being seeded at a slam. How does this feel different for you?
M	Do you feel added pressure being sort of the leading Asian man by some distance at this tournament?
M	Can you describe how life has changed for you in Japan since getting this higher ranking and breaking through the Project 45? What is your popularity like at home now?
M	This is an Olympic year for you. How much of a goal is that, to do well at the Olympics? With there being no other Japanese men near the top, have you thought about playing mixed doubles there?
M	Have you talked to any of the women about mixed at the Olympics?
M	Is Brad Gilbert traveling with you now?
M	You finished?
M	At the end of the year?
M	So who is your fulltime coach now?
M	The best result for a Japanese player in a Grand Slam is quarterfinals, correct?
M	Do you think you're ready to do the same? What is your ambition?
F	Fantastic win. You must be thrilled.
F	Significantly easier than the other time you met her. Did it surprise you?
F	Have you set yourself any targets for this year?
F	You lost heavily in Sydney, but seem to have turned those things around pretty quickly.
F	You looked so in control of those nerves today.
F	What has Louise been bringing to the table?
F	You mentioned staying positive. Is that something you've got better at, in life and even in matches?
F	You sound like you're in a good place.
F	Is it nice to fly under the radar?
F	You spoke briefly on the conditions. Was it a combination of heat and wind?
M	On paper that potentially was a very dicey match. You seemed to take care of business pretty well.
M	So sort of like being at home?
M	What is your mindset coming into 2012?
M	You sound worried already.
M	You made the quarters here five years ago. Do you feel the way you've took off to the degree you have now, do you think this is probably your best slam surface?
M	You mentioned being the topranked American. Did you ever think that you would be the No.1 ranked American?
M	You've given a lot of reasons, fitness, a bit of a wakeup call three or four years ago, getting married, all those things. Is there something that stands out in all those things that you did that got you to where you are at 30, which is unusual?
M	Roddick said yesterday he feels there is a clear gap between the top four and the rest of the field. They've kind of proven that. He said he also thinks it's cyclical, which lends itself to the possibility that maybe one of you guys can break through and knock one of the top four guys out of the semifinals. Does it feel like there's such a wide gulf that Roger, Rafa, Novak, Murray are going to end up in the semis?
M	You've just played Bernie; Sam is going to play him next round. Can you break that down?
M	Do you think he's lightyears ahead of Ryan? How do you see him matching up against Sam?
M	How would you compare him to Ryan, basically the same age?
M	Mardy, you said always one of your goals was to crack the top the top 10; you've done that. What goals do you set for yourself for 2012?
M	How much did you need a mental break after London? When you came to Australia, which was fairly early  you played Hopman Cup  did you actually feel refreshed?
M	Was there anyone in tennis, maybe outside, that was a role model for you in terms of peaking later in their careers?
M	Is the major challenge to beat one of the top four guys, to just knock one of those guys over in a slam?
M	Do you feel any pressure both from yourself and external factors to really match it with these guys?
M	We're used to seeing you a bit quicker into press conferences. Has there been a bit of a problem?
M	Yes.
M	Seemed to turn around so quickly, the momentum, in the second set. Was there anything tactically you did different?
M	Could you sum up what it means to you to reach the final?
M	I'm sure you wouldn't say which opponent you prefer. You've played so much against Andy this year. It's been such a narrative. Would that be in some ways the perfect ending to the year if it was him?
M	When Del Potro is hitting his forehand like that, is there much that can be done?
M	On the face of it, your levels of energy look as though they're pretty good at the moment. Are you feeling inside as good as you looked at the end of the third set today?
M	Do you have a favorite for the Davis Cup final?
M	This is a very special tournament where it can happen where you can play twice with the same players. Some players didn't like that at all. Does it make any difference for you to play the same player twice in the same place, in the same tournament? Do you think psychologically it makes a difference? Would you rather always play a different opponent?
M	A lot of people see Juan Martin as maybe the guy who is most likely to challenge you for the Grand Slam titles. Would you agree with that?
M	Could you sum up the ATP World Tour Finals, your memories really, what the key this week has been to get to the final?
M	Pretty interesting year, you winning the longest Grand Slam final ever, then Rafa beating Bjorn Borg's record, then Federer winning Wimbledon, breaking Sampras' record, then Murray at the US Open. As a fan, which was the best narrative?
M	It's been such a tough season. How much are you looking forward to putting your feet up and doing nothing?
M	You are No.1 in the world. Nobody wants to take anything out of you being No.1. This was in a year where there were four different winners. Murray was the only one who won also Olympic Games. Do you think if he would win, for the public opinion, even if you will be No.1 for the ATP computer, he could be the No.1 in the public opinion image, as it happens for Serena Williams, that she is No.3 in the world but everyone thinks she's the best? What do you think?
M	Everybody obviously knows how much your home country means to you. Are there ways in which you are either as a person or a player a typical Serb? You're atypical in terms of success.
M	You stand out in many ways. Are there ways in which you think of yourself as a typical Serb and are there things about Serbian history or character
M	Whatever way you think that definition is. Are there things about the history of Serbia that inspires you on court?
M	Can you give us your assessment of the match, coming back from a set down?
M	How crucial do you think saving the breakpoints at the beginning of the second set was? On the big points, do you ever consider not going for the lines?
M	Do you believe in the crucial moments when you stay calm, even when your opponent has match points, do you believe you've matured in those situations, like in Shanghai and today coming back from a set down?
M	Given all the history that you have with Andy, going back to juniors, does it make it extra special that you're now having these matches and rivalry right at the top of the game?
M	One of the most interesting stats during the match was that you apparently run 3.2 kilometers during matches against Murray as opposed to 1.8 in matches against others. Can you talk about what it's like playing against someone who is as good a defensive player as you are?
M	You've been pretty clinical this year in matches that come down to a deciding set. Can you talk about the confidence and emotions that go through your mind when it comes down to the wire.
M	Looking ahead to your next match against Tomas Berdych, what are your thoughts?
M	Talking about you going the distance with Andy in the last couple of matches. But when you get into that situation, you're in a fifth set or a third set, do you have flashbacks to the previous couple of occasions when you've gone the distance with him?
M	A question off court. Yesterday Roger was saying a couple of things he can't do, is not able to do, one is cook and another one is skate. If it came down to you, what are some things you just can't do or you're not good at doing?
M	No.1 in the world, millionaires, probably billionaire in a few years. You are a role model and sometimes also a fashion model. Now you're wearing a jacket by UNIQLO which costings $40.
M	Yes. I bought it for my wife.
M	I want to know how much...
M	You get sponsored by UNIQLO.
M	Do you think when you come into press conference, I have to wear this because it's my sponsor or not? Is it worry or not?
M	You had a lot of support out there today. Were you surprised how much there was in front of Andy's home crowd? Does that make a lot of difference to you when it comes to key moments?
M	Today it was much more difficult to play your own game, mainly returning his serve. The score was quite tight. It's not a bad score. You succeeded in doing something.
M	So can you tell us about what you felt on the court?
M	Can you tell us how you felt against such a player? What kind of tactics could you use? Did you think he would start missing?
M	Did you have problems finding the right tactics, or do you believe he was unpredictable?
M	Janowicz is 21 years old. What's your impression of him? Do you believe he's going to be a future top 10? I believe his game is pretty similar to Safin's game.
M	How would you assess the end of this season with this semifinal in Bercy?
M	And about the whole year, how do you assess the year?
M	Are you going to train physically differently then?
M	It's cruel there were no break points until 22. You had the first ones, three in the same game. What happened then? Did he go out of his way to get them back?
M	How does it feel playing against him? There are not many rallies. Is it difficult to keep focused? It's just aces or...
M	On his serve, what is most impressive? His first serves? Very fast, 230 kilometers, or his kick? Very short?
M	What do you remember from the season?
M	Nalbandian seemed pretty comfortable until about 5All in the second set, and there seemed to be a big change when you broke him. Did you feel the match turn there?
M	Is it true you're going to be carrying the Spanish flag during the Olympics? If so, what will that experience mean to you?
M	Has that been mentioned? Has anything been said to you at all or hinted about that possibility?
M	Fans have such great interest in your rivalry with Roger. In your book, you said that if you silence your doubts and you increased your hopes more than Roger did that you could beat him. Could you talk about that and about your doubts that you've had against Roger and how you've overcome those?
M	I have lots of doubts.
M	Did an entire column on doubts.
M	After your long match with Nalbandian about three years ago, you came in and said, He's one of these guys you just can't figure out. Is that still the case?
M	No, before. Remember the one that went to 2:00 in the morning? About three years ago you played Nalbandian.
M	You came in after that and said he was difficult for you to figure out. You just didn't know how to play him. Is that still the case?
M	Roger suggested these courts are very slow, almost as slow as clay, and that most of the tour events are played on slow courts these days. He suggested he may like to see faster courts. How do you feel about that?
M	He suggested she is courts are very slow?
M	That the tour is also playing more tournaments on slower courts and there haven't very many faster courts to play on these days, that perhaps that would be better for...
M	In just a while, the tour will be going to the clay season. When you get out there on clay, what's the feeling like? You feel more confident?
M	On clay.
M	Is clay more fun?
M	Looked like as you began to pull away from Nalbandian in the third set you started to do a lot more serve and volley. Is that something you like to do a little bit more of in your game?
M	Yeah, many.
M	You and Roger have played 27 times already. When this sort of a meeting happens, everybody sits up and takes notice. When you go out on the court to play him, is everything different? Is everything new? Is there a lot of the same stuff from other matches? How do you feel when you go out each time to play Federer?
F	Tough one, Caroline. Want to talk about it?
F	Just talk about...
F	Just talk about how you felt and all that.
F	How much better was her level today than it was Doha? Her level.
F	You looked pretty upset. Is it because you were unable to push yourself forward the way you wanted to when you knew she was playing at a certain level?
F	Can I ask, at the beginning of the tournament you were saying that you were willing to take the things in practice that were new and try to bring them into matches. At times during this tournament you looked like it, but at other times looked like you were kind of hesitating and going back to things that maybe weren't working for you.
F	Any changes to the schedule coming up, or are you going to stick with the same thing?
F	What did your dad say after the match?
F	Yeah.
F	You're probably more upset with yourself than he was.
M	It looked impressive, but how did you feel, the first match back?
M	Roger Federer has suggested that he feels that sometimes you take too long
M	I have something I'd like to add. Today I timed the period between the end of the point and your serve, and you were always within the allowable limit. Were you hurrying because of what Roger said?
M	The top four men in the game now have been so dominant and lose so rarely. When something happens like Murray losing in his first match last night, do you take notice of that? When he lost last night because the top men don't lose very much now, does that catch your attention when that happens?
M	You are known for many things, but also including your mind, your mental strength. When you're in trouble, when your game is not working well, what goes through your mind? What do you say to yourself?
M	Yes, on court.
M	Does your mind ever go too fast? Does it ever race when you're in trouble, or do you stay calm?
M	You had a lot of victories in Roland Garros, but what is your best memory there if you had to choose just one?
M	Yes.
M	You lost today only three or four points on your service. Did you work especially on it during your...
M	You have spoken about yourself, Roger, Novak, Andy, this group of players that's around at the moment.
M	Exactly. Del Potro and all that. What I ask is from what you heard of the past players in the open era, do you think what we have now is probably or possibly the greatest era of men's tennis?
M	We watched you play doubles, and you're a wonderful volleyer.
M	You don't go to the net much. Is that because you win without going to the net?
M	Singles.
M	If you ran into a person who is better at the baseline than you, would you become a volleyer?
M	On your serve, we saw in the US Open in 2010 that the velocity of your serve went up, and it seems that since that it hasn't been at the same level. I'm wondering, is that the conditions of the balls or the conditions in NewYork?
F	Mona, did you have some nerves at the end? Was it trying to serve out the match twice? Was that a new experience and one that's hard to get through a little bit?
F	You've played her three times now this year. This was a much, much closer match than the last one you played her. Were you able to make this one much more competitive and really give yourself a chance to pull off this big one?
F	When you were down in that second set 51, what kind of things were you doing to try to get the match turned around?
F	Did you discover anything against Victoria that was working that maybe didn't previously work?
F	Which part of your game were you most pleased with today?
F	You have a pretty big rise the last nine months or so. What was going on before that?
F	How do you explain that so many girls from Germany are playing so well now?
F	It looks like it's something else other than coincidence. All you German women are big women, good players. You almost think that Germany has acted to encourage big girls to be good tennis players.
F	No one has beaten Azarenka this year, but you've come closer than anybody pretty much. If you had to give the rest of the field in this tournament or anyone advice on how you beat Azarenka, what would you say is the key?
F	A long time at the net at the end of the match. What did she tell you?
F	What are the goals you want to achieve this year?
F	When you talk about school, did you finish college or is it the same...
F	Do you remember this point: you were leading 54 in the third set and you were serving with a 3015 lead. On the next point, you had what looked like an excellent serve and they called a let on it. Without that let you likely would have had a 4015 lead and two match points. Do you remember that point?
F	On those long rallies you seemed to really raise your game on the big points when the big points came up. Is that just part of the evolution of your game this year?
F	At the end of the second set, was it your mother who came and sat beside you?
F	What did she tell you?
F	Congratulations. Next match you might fight against either Li Na or Radwanska. What's your comments on the next opponent? And also, today Kerber was injured. You also suffer from injury before. So as a player, how are you going to try to avoid injury either on the court or off the court? What are you supposed to do to avoid injury?
F	So you didn't really have any sense during the match that something might be a little bit off with her? I mean, I know that she beat you earlier this year in Paris, and I think she played you pretty close last time, as well. For you to come out and dominate this time...
F	Is there anything that you noticed in particular that was different playing against her today than maybe like in Paris when she got you?
F	Can you tell us a little about your candy line, Sugarpova? Are you carrying any bags of candy with you?
F	All this talk about prize money and stuff like that, I'm just wondering, from a personal point of view, do you feel like players are really underpaid? I mean, they seem like "poor little me," like they make a lot of money.
F	Yeah.
F	We know that next round you have a big possibility to meet Li Na. Could you just talk about Li Na, maybe what is your advantage and her advantage, especially when this tournament was held in China?
F	Are there times as a tennis player where the scoreline can kind of dictate your decision of whether to stay in a match or retire from a match if you kind of have a nagging injury?
F	Can you comment on your performance today? Do you think what might have been the most important reason? Is that because you're not prepared for this match? Because I have noticed you have too many unforced errors.
F	After China Open, do you have any plan for the other tournament? I know that you're going to participate into the Federation Cup final. What kind of expectation do you have for that tournament?
F	It kind of seemed like Oprandi wasn't really trying to win a lot of winners or hitting the ball that hard, just trying to extend rallies and waiting for you to make a mistake. Did you feel that way, as well?
F	She also kind of was going with the dropshot a lot. Is that something that maybe surprised you or caught you offguard?
F	How do you feel you served? She broke you a few times, but it wasn't like you were doublefaulting all that much.
F	For your opponent today, you didn't beat her for three times before, so what might have been the reasons for you to defeat her today? For the second set, in the very beginning, you took a big lead, and unfortunately she tried to catch up but finally you made it and then win the game. What might have been the reason?
F	I have two questions. After the match I know that you drew a heart when you give signature. I don't know what that's for. The second: We notice two statistics today. The first you have eight break point chances, but just only master four. And then the opponent have nine break point chances but she masters four. So that's a very important indication that you have a very stable performance and you have a very good performance in handling the critical ball.
F	You have already participated into China Open and GuangZhou Open. I know that you are going to go to Europe to participate in the ITF. I want to doublecheck whether it is the real schedule you are going to have. Another part of my question is some players are very much influenced by injuries. So I really want to understand, how is your fitness right now? This is the thing that we care most from the perspective of fans.
F	We know that in last season you have a very good performance. In this season, you were injured and also change the racquet. Do you think this year it's a special year for you? You have a lot of test from God? How do you say that?
F	Just now you mentioned that it's more important to focus on the physical fitness. Did you ever try to discuss with Allen that for example in terms of the recovery and the physical fitness training, you will inject more energy to make yourself stronger than ever before?
F	Come back to this match. In the first or second set, at every match point or set point, in the first set it's easy to guard the set point, but in the second set it's not easy for you to keep the, you know, set point. But anyway, you win. Do you have any specific plan to celebrate?
M	Bit of controversy at the end. What was your take on it all?
M	So you wouldn't have complained if you had to replay the point?
M	Tomas says that his understanding is unless it's an ace, the point should always be replayed.
M	Seemed to be going pretty smoothly and then you were holding your knee a bit in the second set. Was that a problem?
M	Is it the usual split patella thing?
M	Second set frustrating for you? You broke twice, you came back, and then there were all those match points.
M	How would you sum up the match itself?
M	Is it particularly pleasing to beat someone you've lost to the last three times?
M	About five years ago.
M	People would be happy pretty happy tomorrow if it's you against Novak after the way that match went in Melbourne.
M	To beat him after Australia tomorrow, if that was the case, what would it mean? Same question I asked you I think the first day you came here.
M	You played three matches in a row at 2:00 in the afternoon, bright sunshine, and the matches at the sharp end of the tournament have played in the evening under the lights. Would you have preferred to have had a night match by now?
M	That said, can I ask you a bit of a silly question?
M	What factor sunblock do you use? Because if you spend all that amount of time out in the sun, you still look as if you've had a fortnight up on the north coast of Scotland.
M	Your reaction to the win? How do you feel about your firstround match?
M	Is it intimidating facing a Djokovic, although not Novak? Does it play with your mind?
M	You've faced Novak and Marko now. Are there similarities between their style of play, would you say, at this stage from what you've seen?
M	Next it's Dolgopolov or Del Potro, two tough opponents. Juan Martin just won in Marseilles. How do you see that clash?
M	A lot of us are quite interested about the emergence of Kazakhstan as a tennis nation. We know most of you guys are born in Russia. How much time do you actually spend in Kazakhstan?
M	Offseason?
M	What are the facilities like in Kazakhstan?
M	Does the Federation ask you to help with young players in the country?
M	When you were asked to change your nationality from Russian to Kazakhstan, was it a big decision for you?
M	What kind of numbers do you see in the sport in Kazakhstan?
M	Children, how many children?
M	And your passport, is it just Kazakhstan or Russia and just Kazakhstan?
F	Good one to get through, wasn't it? Tough match.
F	When you're coming up against a player who did well last week, does it make you extra sharp going into the match, or is it like any other match?
F	You got a cold?
F	How long you been suffering with that then?
F	Quite a lot girls are not too well.
F	Is it the fact that it's unseasonable chilly here?
F	You've had sort of two different careers. How did things turn around for you in the singles?
F	Was there more focus on physical fitness after what you went through?
F	Jelena Jankovic next. Talk about that match.
F	Going back to today's game, obviously when an opponent wins the second set on tiebreak, perhaps the crowd is thinking, This could be quite tight and whatnot. More often than not, it seems that that player then drops down a level and the opponent just sails through, as happened today. What was that boundary? Did you step up? Did she drop off?
F	Vika pulled out today; obviously Petra is not here. Does that open up the draw for someone like yourself?
F	Quite a difficult start for you, and then you kind of ran away with it, didn't you?
F	It took 16 minutes to finish the first three games. Were you feeling her out, the court, the conditions?
F	What was the best part of your game today?
F	Talk about your first serve percentage.
F	I don't know if someone already asked you this, but the past four years you've come here, first round out.
F	What's going to be different this time?
F	You got to the third round in Australia and lost to Kvitova.
F	You retired. You then got to the final in Pattaya. How do you feel about the season so far?
F	You called for the trainer I believe quite early on. Was there a problem there?
F	When did you arrive in Dubai?
F	You manage to get out and about at all?
F	Next match will be a tough match. How do you expect it?
F	Ana Ivanovic or Schiavone.
F	Both players are very tough players on hard.
F	You have a better record against Ivanovic, I believe, compared to your record against Schiavone. Would you prefer to see Ana win in a way?
M	Was the key today that you played better the big points, saving all the breakpoints?
M	How important is tomorrow for you after seven defeats with Novak, and seven wins here in MonteCarlo for you? Is it a match like any others or not?
M	Are you sure the pain is less?
M	What does it mean for you to go to an eighth final in a row here after the problems you have with your knee?
M	Do you hope for a windy day tomorrow?
M	You come from an island. Maybe.
M	You say that Novak is the favorite tomorrow because you have not enough training sessions.
M	You talk about the physical condition. The kind of story we had in Melbourne with the physical condition. Do you feel better now?
M	You made it to the finals.
M	Physical performance.
M	Do you feel better now than you did in Melbourne?
M	Will you try something different tomorrow?
M	I don't know. That's my question.
M	Play more aggressive?
M	Even if you lost seven times, the two matches you lost on clay are one year ago. You were not playing at your best when you lost in Madrid and in Rome. I don't know what you think.
M	Did you see the match of Djokovic today with Berdych?
M	What's your opinion about it?
M	Apart from those two games, maybe being difficult to wake up, it was a very good match.
M	What went so well today? Did you have a better feeling on the court or are you better physically?
M	What about your serve?
M	Last time you won a match like this, you won the tournament. Is that a good omen?
M	Who is going to win in the match between your opponents?
M	Who would you prefer?
M	Did Davis Cup on clay help you feel more comfortable?
M	We've been talking a lot about being 27 years old lately. How many years do you intend to keep playing?
M	Would you like to play the quarterfinals here? It would be your first on clay.
M	Are you thinking about a possible quarterfinal against Jo?
M	Back on the center court after Davis Cup, did you think about it?
M	In the first two sets you were up a break and things became more complicated. What happened? Was he playing more aggressive?
M	But you played on this surface for the Davis Cup.
M	But did the Davis Cup preparation help you?
M	When you play that kind of match, do you want to win lovelove, as quickly as possible, or do you prefer the match to become a bit more complicated just to see how you are reacting?
M	How do you see your clay court season? Is it going to be difficult, especially with the Olympic Games on the horizon?
M	You're supposed to be a hard court player. However, your best results in Grand Slams have been in the French Open.
M	After winning the match, did you think, Oh, good?
M	What about your next opponent, Melzer?
M	Since last summer you've been playing a lot, but you took some time to cool off. Are you back on track now?
F	How difficult in your mind is it, given the status of Caroline, who hurt her knee, hopefully she's able to go tomorrow, but does that affect your preparation at all?
F	Can you talk about how you're hitting the ball? Seems like you're in a nice rhythm. Happy with where your game is right now?
F	Quick match today. You had a walkthrough in the second round. Are you getting as much work as you like? Is it important that Caroline be able to play tomorrow just for your sake?
F	You've won a lot of matches, making your way up the rankings. Can you talk about where your game is and your career right now.
F	We were all expecting some drama with the ankle, but it didn't seem to bother you out there.
F	How did you feel coming off with the ankle? Going into Dubai, do you think it's going to be something you have to think about? Do you think it was not as serious as you originally thought? Playing today, how did it feel?
F	Talk about the match. Obviously you dominated. What can you say about the match? What do you feel you did really well against Stosur?
F	Third title of the year. You keep winning. As you keep winning, is the excitement just the same? Is it as exciting to win every time you do it?
F	As he said, third title this year. Maybe talk about your year. It's early on, but you've already got the Australian Open, you're No.1. Now a third title. They year is turning out to be, early on, pretty good.
F	Before playing Sydney, did you expect that it was going to be better than usual?
F	I didn't say that.
F	Did you feel a little bit better than usual?
F	Sam Stosur mentioned confidence. That's something that's hard to quantify, but you've got this winning streak going. I mean, do you go out on the court feeling  with that confidence, does that make a big difference? It's not like you have a weapon that you didn't have three or four months ago. Do you think confidence is a big factor for you doing so well?
F	As you said earlier, last year you were watching the game on TV and you were sad because you were not here. So how do you feel...
F	Pictures. So how does it feel to have your first trophy here in Doha?
F	One of the things that came out in Australia was you know, I think you and Maria Sharapova both have you're very vocal during the match with, I guess, whooping or whatever it is. Then there was some talk afterwards, I think, but someone said they're going to start training young kids not do that. Someone explained to me that's kind of how you guys it's a breathing thing. Obviously it's a little bit of distraction, but if someone said, Okay, you can't do that anymore, is that something you could go on the court and adjust like that, or is this something that will be with us for your entire career?
F	I do, actually.
F	Well, there are ways, I guess.
F	Yeah.
F	I mean, when people bring this up or people say...
F	There you go.
F	That's the point that people say is it's a distraction for other players. I mean, I don't play I'm not out there against you. But do you think you talk about confidence being overrated. This whole controversy over yelling and kind of vocals on the court, is this something that's way overrated and people need to move on to something else?
F	Djokovic, Nadal, and Federer will be flag bearers at the Olympics. Could you be for Belarus? Would you like it?
F	And 10 out of 11 titles obtained on the hard courts. What do you want to do to improve on grass and clay now?
F	What do you think worked well for you today in the match?
F	How have you done in the past with her?
F	In past matches.
F	Do you sense when you're on the court with her that she's lost maybe a little of that confidence?
F	Compare it to when you played, though, her game. Do you think like the players are figuring her out a little bit more and frustrating her?
F	I think you played well today. I'm suggesting that the players have kind of figured out what tactics work against her well.
F	Where do you think that she was vulnerable today that caused you to win the match?
M	What was the conversation like between and you Andy?
M	Does it bother you at all that you didn't get a match to get there? Might you be underplayed when you get to the quarterfinals?
M	I know it's a dubious honor to be in the quarterfinals because your opponent had to withdraw, but I want to ask you this: Although you are in the quarterfinals, there was such hype about this match. Had, let's say, Andy not come to the tournament there would have been a lucky loser to kind of substitute. Do you feel that the rules of tennis could be changed? That perhaps when the player goes on for a victory and then withdraws from his next match there should be a lucky loser so that way the fans would in not denied the match that they should see?
M	How much is this helping you in terms of rest and preparation for your next match?
M	Obviously there are implications here pertaining to ranking and seeding going into the US Open. Is that something you think about at all?
M	Just a general question about rain delays. The forecast for tomorrow is a disaster too. Is this something that you ever get used to as a player, having to deal with the uncertainty? How do you deal with that?
M	We won't have a chance to talk to you before the quarterfinal. What would you think if you ended up playing Isner just because you guys are both known for your big serves? Is it a confrontation you look forward to? Is there something special about it?
F	She said that it only felt like your arm was warmed up for that because it didn't seem like you played twoandahalf hours. Is that what you felt?
F	Your matchup for the semifinal, it gives you a chance to move on to the final. It's been a while since we have had someone here in Montreal win backtoback years in Montreal. Your thoughts on that and what stands in your path.
F	You have had so many matches with Aleksandra. I think this was the ninth. Won eight of them and the other one you retired. What is it you've got going against her to win that?
F	You ended up putting a patch or bandage of some sort on your upper shin or lower knee, whatever. What was bothering you? Is winning the cure?
F	Am I correct in assuming that you seemed a little bit tired out there? Was that a result of the big Olympic run you had until the quarterfinals?
F	The match seemed to turn on the rain delay there. You dropped the first set, then 44. Was the rain delay a factor, do you think, or was it that the opponent seemed to have an injury?
F	Is it good to get a match like that out of the way going into the rest of the tournament if you've overcome some adversity, maybe?
F	The game seemed to take a while to pick up speed. There wasn't a whole lot of rhythm. Is it hard to get involved in that kind of a game?
M	You looked frustrated with yourself really until sort of well into the second set. How did you sort of turn it around?
M	After the game, we saw that you wrote 'happy birthday' to somebody. I didn't recognize the name. People said it's for your girlfriend. Is that true?
M	So it's a wish, a surprise?
M	You wanted to win this game very much?
M	Can you talk a little bit about the ending of the third set, because you won 21 of the last 26 points. It just seemed like you shifted gears.
M	You could face Roger for the first time since the Olympic final. Can you talk about what playing Roger does for you, what you enjoy about it when you're out on court.
M	Are you satisfied with your serve, your firstserve percentage? It was 54%. Are you satisfied with that?
M	You were in control early on, completely in control. I noticed you had a medical timeout. Then you missed an overhead in the second. First of all, what was the problem? Why did you need the medical timeout? Can you talk me through the match afterwards.
M	Looking forward, do you feel under more pressure now being seeded higher in tournaments, particularly after your most recent success? How has that changed your approach to tournaments?
M	First of all, how do you feel about this match? How do you comment on your performance over the past two or three years and in which areas do you think you need to improve?
M	There are three male players from China in the first round. You're the first Chinese player. Any advice for the other two Chinese players?
M	Zhang Ze played pretty well in the China Open and had some breakthroughs. He thought his coach helped him a lot. What do you think about his coach?
M	Over the past two years many people say that to have a breakthrough with the male tennis players, we need to learn a lot from the female team. Any ideas from you?
M	Next year there will be the national games. Is it true that you, together with other Chinese male tennis players, will focus more on the national games rather than the other tournaments?
M	I also want to know whether this will have some effect on your personal ranking.
M	I heard from Zhang Ze about his career plan. He hoped that he can be in the top 100 and play the Grand Slams. What about you? Do you have any clear career plan?
M	You mentioned there are a lot of factors which may affect your performance. I suppose you have a very good coach, a good team. Will you choose to fly solo?
M	Can you give me more details?
M	Because everybody is discussing this issue. Sometimes players find it very difficult to make choices, so I want to know whether players really want to fly solo.
M	If you look at the male players in China, what are the reasons why they don't want to be an individual player? Is it because of their poor performance?
M	What are the main or biggest obstacles which may hinder the further development of the Chinese male tennis players?
M	I know that you have had your current ranking for one to two years. You also said that you hope your ranking can move up to the top 100. What is the most difficult thing for you to move your ranking higher? I know you work very hard. You have been working very hard over the past several years. What are the main ways to push your ranking?
M	Congratulations. First semifinal here. Also on your birthday. Can you talk a little bit about what you're feeling now?
M	In terms of the speed of the court, did you feel like that was favorable to your game also in terms of because some of the outside courts are playing a little bit faster than the stadium court.
M	Djokovic/Ferrer?
F	Do you feel fortunate in a way with getting through that match when it was pretty tough?
F	How about the double faults? Are you worried at all?
F	You've gotten through the first two rounds despite them. Will they catch up with you at some point?
F	Off the subject, but a few weeks ago you played a point with Rory McIlroy, right?
F	Number one, could you assess his abilities? Number two, did you throw the point? number three, do you play golf?
F	You hit long on purpose?
F	Can you talk about what it adds when the Williams sisters are in a tournament? People say women's tournaments lack rivalries, and you and Serena had such a great rivalry for such a long time. What does it bring when they're both in the field?
F	Have you watched them both play? How do you think they're doing, considering both of their layoffs?
F	How would you compare the Penn balls at this tournament to Wilson balls or balls at other tournaments? Which better suits your game?
F	So you think more of it's more conditions rather than balls?
F	Do you ever stick around and scout an opponent or on a day off go watch an opponent, a possible future opponent?
F	I want to ask another equipment question about stringing. Some players are very, very particular and like to change the strings based on weather and stuff like that. How particular are you about the stringing of the racquet? Do you have your own stringer? Do you use the ones onsite?
F	Uhhuh. You're not into the science?
F	This is the first tournament kind of where everyone's back: The Williams sisters are back; Kim Clijsters came back; pretty much the entire WTA Tour is healthy. Can you discuss the depth of the WTA Tour right now, you know, again, presuming health of everyone? Do you think it's the deepest it's been in a while?
F	Seemed like a match where the scoreline was reflective of how it went, tough start, and then...
F	You said you don't hang around the locker rooms, but how much did you know about her game or her personality?
F	You're into the fourth round for the eighth time in nine showings. What is it about this tournament and the conditions that really suits your game?
F	Do you think it's harder to face somebody that's new for you?
F	Is your family here with you? Is your dad living in Florida now?
F	Where is he now?
F	Are you one of the spokespeople or representatives for the Winter Olympics in Sochi?
F	Are you going, planning on going?
F	Makarova is a player who can step it up in bigtime way.
F	Have you had a chance to follow the comeback of Kleybanova at all?
F	Do you have any plans like Federer, Tsonga? They're going to be in South America in the end of the year. Do you have any plans out of the regular tournaments?
F	Yes.
M	What was it like having somebody return your serve like four meters behind the baseline?
M	How do you adjust that? Try to be more accurate, less powerful?
M	Isn't that a message for you to just go in when a guy is standing that far back?
M	The last four serves were 137, 135, 136, 129. So what were you thinking then? Seems like every time I watch you play your matches they're pretty long. My question to you is: Mentally how have you become a better player?
M	Is that the new confidence you have? After you lose the first set that you'll figure it out?
M	How does somebody 6'10" volley so beautifully?
M	It's been a few days now since getting into the top 10, and I appreciate it's not the end of the road for you, you want to go higher. But has it sunk in that you're in the top 10 for the first time? And how are you feeling now about it?
M	You might have Tsonga down the road. He's looking pretty good. What are your thoughts on that possible match down the road?
M	Lately you have become like very difficult to beat when you get, you know, the guys out there at the end of a match. So you're very seems like you're very confident. What was the difference before and now? Where do you get this level of confidence just serving out a match?
M	(Question concerning weather in Indian Wells.)
M	Milos was asked who has the harder serve, you or him. He said he has the harder one but you place it better. Do you agree with that?
F	Congratulations.
F	This wraps up obviously a big year for you. How important was it for you to get it title and end it on a good note all the same?
F	How close were you to not playing this tournament potentially? I know you've been sick for sometime between here in the US Open.
F	Why all the pressure? Why after the year that you've had did you want to win this one so badly?
F	You've only lost one match since you lost at the French Open. How much credit of that goes to your new partnership with Patrick, or is there anything else that you've done to change? And just even bouncing back from that loss.
F	You started the week a little bit slow and you really didn't have your rhythm, even though you didn't drop a set, and today was pretty good overall. Talk about the performance. She didn't have a break point; you were hitting winners from everywhere.
F	Talk about how you focus. You get out there in front of this crowd, it's totally sold out, and people are yelling and screaming. Are you in your zone and able to block everything out and focus on the ball?
F	You played in so many Grand Slams and so many of these Championships. What do you think about the quality of the women's game now as compared to how it was perhaps when you' first emerged as a player, the depth of quality in the women's game?
F	How do you rank this season in your career?
F	When you look back after couple of years, what is the biggest thing you're going to you remember about this tournament?
F	Yeah.
F	You said you knew you were a heavy favorite coming into this tournament. How heavy a favorite will you be at the Australian Open, do you think?
F	Have you got another Serena slam in you?
F	On Monday on the media day, Li Na was speaking about you and she said that when Serena is on her 100% she's impossible beat. Do you feel invincible? Obviously she's right.
F	Patrick suggested that despite all you've achieved in the game that you can still improve. Do you agree with that? If so, can you say how you go about it without giving away secrets?
F	At the top of the game at the moment you have, as it were, two 31 year olds, Roger Federer and yourself. What do you think that says about the longevity of tennis? If a young player is coming in now, they're probably got a very long career ahead of them before they actually reach their ultimate.
F	Could you ever imagine a time when you wouldn't want to be competitive and out there playing tennis?
F	They announced the candidates for the 2014 locations for the tournament. How much of a priority do you think it should be for the WTA to find somewhere that can kind of replicate this kind of environment, this sort of overflow crowds you get here, the enthusiasm, because it hasn't always been that way.
F	Start of the year you tore up your ankle in Brisbane.
F	I know. Thinking back to that and not sure if you could play the Aussie, if you would've know you would've gotten to this point where you're Olympic gold and Wimbledon, and US Open champion, I guess you might have taken that, huh?
F	So Patrick says you're going to be training in Mauritius.
F	Yeah, he does. That's a change for you. No L.A., no Florida. He didn't talk that much.
F	But he said you were training in Mauritius. For you to put yourself out there, staying in Paris, going to Mauritius, not doing the normal things, is it something you're trying to do in your life to change things up and keep it fresh?
F	I never seen you so fast to go to the net and play so much at the net.
F	The net, play so offensive all the time. Do you think this is the evolution of yourself to play shorter points, always every match, and this is the best Serena?
F	The statistics are good.
F	Is this the best Serena in' your mind?
F	No, this one, this Serena.
F	You've been playing very hard, and then maybe after tomorrow back to your country. So what are you imagining in Istanbul, the Turkish people?
F	You're playing all the week. You're playing hard.
F	No, no, playing all week here.
F	Tomorrow it's back to your country maybe after tomorrow.
F	No, what are your thoughts of Istanbul?
F	So for example, what are you doing tomorrow?
F	I may be wrong, but at one point I hear you shouting in French, Allez.
F	So you didn't shout allez in French today?
F	Anyway, I was told by Patrick that you're practicing in French, correct?
F	She's a very good player, but you just seem to have her number and win the big points when you need to. Talk a little bit about the match and coming back in the second.
F	Seemed like there were a lot of momentum swings in this match, even within games. A lot of games started one way and went another. How easy was it for you to sort of get a rhythm in this match?
F	In some ways you were saying coming in here you were practicing, you were sick of practice, but you hadn't played in five weeks. Maybe expecting to play really well off the bat was a little unreasonable and you're now in the groove three matches in?
F	Long layoff, and now you've played three matches and you'll get a day off. Looking forward to the day off or still ready to go?
F	Just breaking down the matchup against her, you've lost to her once and you've beaten her five times this year. The US Open match was super close, but what do you think the little or medium size or big difference is that gets you the wins every time?
F	Seems like given your record against her and Maria that you don't mind playing the hard, flat hitters, that you kind of invite the matchup.
F	I saw when you were coming on the courts a nice picture of you with the gold medalist Serena Williams on your bag. Is that luck for you?
F	Olympic gold medalist Serena Williams.
F	On your sport bag.
F	Last night I was watching you on TV and you were saying you love it here and you would like to move to Istanbul. How serious were you?
F	Last night in the TV interview you said you loved Istanbul and you would consider about moving here to Istanbul. How serious were you?
F	The last Championships you played was in Doha, and then this is your first time in Istanbul. Can you compare the two cities, the two hosts?
F	How much are you looking forward to Monday and vacation?
F	In some ways too I would think given how well you've done the last six or seven months that you have the feeling I don't want season to end; I just keep winning and winning.
F	You likely play Radwanska in the semifinals the way things are shaking out now. You guys haven't played since that Wimbledon final, which was pretty up and down. Talk about the players that play with spin and stuff. Talk about that matchup and the challenges she presents.
F	It's been a while since you played. Just talk about how you felt it went, whether you had rhythm.
F	Are you okay physically? Do you feel you're moving all right? Body responding to what you want it to do?
F	You lost to her last time you played in Cincinnati. You seem to have a pretty good record in your career of avenging losses. Is that something that can motivate you on court?
F	You were not here last year. How do you find the grounds, atmosphere, and the supporters?
F	We saw you quite emotional out there, kind of fist pumping and screaming. Was that intensity? Nerves? What were you going through emotionally on court today?
F	How much do you care about finishing No.1 as opposed to winning majors?
F	Obviously you had a great summer, but you haven't played since the US Open final. Coming out tonight, were you wondering, How am I going to hold up? Am I going to be able to play as well? Am I going to be rusty?
F	Did you follow the Lance Armstrong stuff at all?
F	Yeah.
F	Not really about the specifics, but you're aware of who he was.
F	So for something like that to happen to a legend where all of his titles are gone and his reputation is trashed, just your reactions to that.
F	He never tested positive but the government found him guilty and striped him of his titles, yeah.
F	Do you feel testing in tennis  you talked about this before  do you feel it's stringent enough?
F	Kerber's coach said it was very high level for first match, and he said for Kerber it was new experience and she was really excited and felt it at the end. Do you remember yourself for your first experience for your first master? How did you feel during your first master, and were you as excited as she was?
F	And about your first experience in a masters, do you remember it?
F	You told us that it's your first time here. How will you spend your free time in Istanbul, and what are going to be the souvenirs you will take home?
F	After the tournament.
F	Talk a little bit about what the WTA was like for you in terms scheduling and commitments and tournaments before 2009 and the Roadmap and how it differs from how it is now?
F	Some of the younger players have been a bit more vocal about wanting more flexibility sometimes with the tournaments. They I feel like it's a little bit constricting in what tournaments they can or can't play. What's your response to that, or do you feel the same way?
F	On a very small organizational point, the in the men's championships they play on alternate days. You've had to play today and tomorrow. Do you think it would be more sensible if you played it group by group so you're all playing on the same day?
F	I think after this you go to Africa; is that right?
F	Talk about your plans for your offseason schedule and how rest for next season works into that?
F	You going to play against Li Na tomorrow. What would you like to say about this game?
F	Did you feel you were out of your league today playing Serena today? That the gap of talent was just incredible today.
F	We use a term, out of our league, that she was at a different level of talent because of her game today. Did you feel a little intimidated being on the tennis court the way she was playing?
F	Was there anything you could do today tacticswise to try to get into the match?
F	When she's at her best, can anybody beat her?
F	What do you think about the final? Is Serena the clear winner?
F	How would you describe your fire to win this tournament right now?
F	Sam said that she played her best tennis of the tournament today but it wasn't enough. Did you play your best tennis of the tournament today?
F	How important is it to have a match like this where you really are challenged? Because thus far at this tournament you have dominated.
F	What were you telling to yourself in the third set when you kept being ahead and she was coming back then the breaker was crazy and you had this 5All. What was going through your mind?
F	At 5All in the tiebreaker, what did you think? You know, you hit an ace. Were you nervous at that point?
F	To go up 65 in the breaker. You saved a break point 5All.
F	How often do you have to tell yourself, Don't be a chicken?
F	Did you know that the No.1 ranking was on the line?
F	So when you went like this at the end to your box, that wasn't...
F	Do you ever get nervous during matches anymore and were you nervous at any time today?
F	When you faulted were you nervous or you just went for the serve too much?
F	You put it behind you just like that?
F	I want to ask you a question about your ambition. You said, "I want this." Does that mean I just want to win this tournament? Does it mean I want to be No.1 at the end of the year? Does it mean I want to win 10 Grand Slams? What is your ambition about tennis?
F	You have obviously had a great year since Australia. Maybe not the results, but did you miss not having the trophy? Did you miss it? Is that part of, I want to get that feeling back again?
F	You have been working with your coach about three years now?
F	How important was it for you to find the right person? What was that process like?
F	If you play Maria in the next round, not looking too far ahead, just one match now, how would you describe what that match will depend on and what you've learned from playing her this year?
F	You were talking about learning to trust Sam. How long has it taken you to trust your own instincts on court, or did that just come automatically?
F	Going back to the ace that was 5All, break point in the third set. You only served one ace in the whole match. Does that show your ability to come up in the clutch? Did that feel like a clutch moment for you to come up with that?
F	One ace down the middle.
F	It was a big moment to come up with the ace because she had she just got in front she could break for 65.
F	The other thing was the squash shots that she came up with a few times and surprised you. Do you see many of those on tour? Is that another one that Sam has in her arsenal not many others do?
F	With your win today you keep your No.1 ranking. You have a slam; you've been No.1 for a while. How meaningful is it to stay No.1 to you?
F	Maybe talk about Bartoli a bit. You played her this year.
F	When you played Maria at Australia, what do you think the key to that match was?
F	Many people, especially Europeans, the first time they come here don't like the US Open. They don't like the energy. It's too much. It's overwhelming and distracting, crazy traffic. You obviously clearly love playing here. Did you always feel that way, or was it an evolution to get there? What's it like to sort of get to the place where you love it?
F	You come off court feeling disappointed or satisfied with the performance that was quite strong at the end?
F	Very different in that way to anyone you played before?
F	Moving forward after the great week you have had, what can you take from this to push on?
F	Is the fact that you produced this consistency in performance proved to yourself that you really can compete with these girls?
F	Now that you're out of the tournament, have you had a chance to digest that you will always be remembered as the person who played Kim Clijsters in her last singles match?
F	What especially in the way you played the last three or four days have you been most pleased with?
F	Do you feel like you'll be looked at a bit differently in the locker room after these wins?
F	You said unforced errors today. You also appeared not to be hanging back on anything. You were swinging through all of your shots. Do you count those as errors or just as an unsuccessful winner?
F	Now that you've had these big wins, do you think you're ready for more than this in the future? Do you see yourself in second weeks of slams?
F	Where is it next?
F	When you watched that Kim interview last night, were you crying?
F	The Asian leg for you, is the key reaching the level you achieved here on the regular tour to prove to yourself week in and week out you can get there?
F	Do you get any downtime or straight into tournaments again?
F	Have you been aware of the levels of support you've had, especially from people back home who have been willing you on through this adventure?
F	This shopping expedition, anything in particular you're looking for?
F	Is there a particular serve of Sam's that you'd never seen before and really caused you more issues than others, like the kicker out wide on the advantage side, for instance?
F	What did you do when you realized the camera crew was for you?
F	Could you have expected when you arrived here in New York that you'd beat two Grand Slam champions to earn that right to shop?
F	Do you have a ranking target where you want to be at the end of the year?
F	Have you worked out what this will do to your ranking? Have you been calculating a little bit?
F	With your new coach, what will your training base be away from tournaments?
M	26 out of 27 net points won today. Do you ever remember a statistic like that?
M	What are your thoughts on the Davis Cup tie against The Netherlands in Amsterdam? Will you be there?
M	But will you be there?
M	The Spanish media published today that Rafael Nadal may not play until next year. How do you feel about it? Did you ever have a conversation with him about his many injuries?
M	Maybe gave him some advice?
M	Aside from doing all these press conferences time and time again, what is the toughest thing you've had to go through in your career?
M	You're known for your game management. When you are having a tough time out on court, is the most important thing to stay calm?
M	When you started out, social media is not what it is today. Is that better for a player to be able to tell people in their own words or is it better to be judged by the outside world?
M	From the athlete's standpoint, are you happier being able to give out the information yourself, or do you want other people to judge you?
M	Stan said yesterday if you played more doubles you could be the best doubles player in the world. Do you think playing at the Olympics improved your singles game at all?
M	Has it improved your volley or your play at net? You played doubles four weeks ago at the Olympics...
M	Has that positively impacted your singles play?
M	But you practiced.
M	After the match today you mentioned as you were serving for it you had some memories of the semifinal last year. Can you talk more about that.
M	How do you feel physically after your first day match in New York's humidity? Sounds like you may have a bit of a cold. You're sniffling a bit?
M	Can you compare the two quite different experiences of playing a big match on Centre Court Wimbledon versus playing on Ashe?
M	You mentioned the great Dutch fans. What are the most intense fans that you played in front of?
M	Do you feel as much pressure to win a slam now as you did before you won one?
F	Obviously an extremely long day for you but great result. Take us through your day a little bit.
F	How much did you worry? Did you think it was a solvable problem from the start?
F	Was it a chickenandtheegg thing, you had to make the shots first before you got comfortable?
F	Do you think you'll be ready for the next round?
F	Serena has talked a lot about how great of a player you are. What have you gotten from her relationship?
F	Curious about your doubles game. How much does that help you with singles? Does that give you some techniques, some help playing singles?
F	Has Serena given you any advice about handling the Open or New York, to deal with the craziness of this slam?
F	If she's not discussing actual technical things with you regarding tennis, does she discuss the way to handle the tour?
F	Mixed doubles yesterday. Singles and doubles today. Mixed doubles tomorrow.
F	You're on the schedule, I think. How are you able to keep up with that type of schedule?
F	How about that forehand set up for match point? One of the best shots you ever hit?
F	Was it a hard place to dig yourself out of? You didn't appear to be disappointed by the missed match points.
F	What do you think this result says about the state of your game and perhaps even your potential?
F	Obviously she's a player that you respect. How hard is it to keep the occasion out of your mind, you were the one putting an end to her career?
F	Laura, you looked like you couldn't believe it at the end, but did you really believe it beforehand?
F	Given the progress you've made this year, what do you think the main improvements you've made are?
F	How did you find playing on Arthur Ashe?
F	You haven't been with your new coach for very long. Would you say that change has had any input into this result?
F	In the last month or so you've added a big line to your CV with the silver medal, one thing that Clijsters never even had in her career, an Olympic medal. How much do you think the confidence of that moment helped you in a match like this?
F	You said that you were really trying to keep out the thought that you could be the last opponent in her career. Were there moments at all in the match where that thought occurred to you, or was it only afterwards? Could you describe what that was like, to realize that you have that distinction.
F	Do you feel like the girl that shot Bambi?
F	The matches against Sharapova that you didn't win, did they inspire you?
F	You talked on court about Kim being a role model for you. What particular qualities do you think?
F	Obviously this is a big individual scalp for you, but also your first time in the third round of a slam, which has to feel like a pretty big accomplishment. How much does that level of what you've accomplished mean to you?
F	Do you think this win will change the way you're going to be perceived in the locker room around the tour?
F	Did you prove anything to yourself in this match? You delivered in a big match on a big stage.
F	How would you describe the pressures that you perceive on British players given the Grand Slam drought?
F	What are your thoughts on the way Andy has handled his career and dealt with the various pressures?
F	Did you see any of Johanna's match, and how good is it to have some company in the tournament?
M	A lot of sweating out there tonight. How tough were the conditions?
M	What did you do to change the match around in the second set?
M	You had a high percentage of net winners. Is that something you're working on or is that against this guy?
M	Surprised by your backhand? Was it just not being able to execute your backhand in game time that surprises you?
M	You have the prospect of playing Andy Roddick here.
M	Are you ready for some banter from the crowd?
M	On Rod Laver Arena you like to engage with the crowd. There will be opportunity to banter with Americans. Will you get involved?
M	What's the key?
M	You have gotten a few wins under your belt the last few weeks. What's changed for you?
M	Has it been the change of surface?
M	I think Roger said before he played in Cincinnati, Andy said today, it's pretty hard for younger guys to maintain that consistency. Is that how you feel or do you feel you're maturing, coming out of the end of that period?
M	Do you think the big stages bring out the best in your tennis? Do you enjoy it?
M	Lleyton has had quite a rivalry with Roddick down the years. Do you remember watching matches between those two? Will you tap into Lleyton's background on Roddick?
M	You will be looking for a familiarization on Ashe?
M	Have you had a hit out there?
F	How pleased are you with the result out there today?
F	What were the last few weeks like for you?
F	Feel better?
F	Why all those tests for just a stomach bug? Did you think it was bigger?
F	Why?
F	So the night before the Olympic final, how bad was the pain?
F	That didn't pass the smell test. What was it like? Was it a serious pain? Did it impact your play?
F	After all the development, the planning, the trips to Spain, it's finally going to come out, if I understand correctly, but there's a little bit of a problem. There's a guy named Roger Federer who has Lindor truffles. As a marketing person now, how would you tell America to try Sugarpova and not Roger's?
F	Ultimately can a gumball stand up to a truffle?
F	It sounds like you were hurting at the Olympics. When you get into a thing where you lose like that, is it one of those things that you just hit the delete button the second you walk off the court or is it something that sticks with you until you get back on the court again?
F	Were you actually able to get to sleep at night after you carried the flag?
F	That must have been an incredible experience for you.
F	What went through your mind as you were carrying the flag around the track?
F	Since the comeback you've reached the final of the other three slams but not here. What would it mean to make a run into the second week?
F	Obviously the tests went well in Montral. It turned out it was a stomach bug of some sort. What was going through your mind when you were feeling pain like that? Must have been pretty serious to need all that, or at least felt like it was.
F	In your years here you worked with a lot of individuals. How would you compare the culture of sports in America, training, and in Russia?
F	Well, just the culture of sports. Here it's so dynamic, so individualistic. There's an economic engine to it. Can you compare the cultures?
F	If you become a mom, would you bring your kid to an academy? Do you like the academy environment?
F	To keep playing tennis day after day, it's something that helps you not to think too much about your upcoming marriage or not? Normally for a woman it's a big moment. You don't have almost the time to think about what's going on.
F	It's not?
F	Not in this year anyway?
F	Tough match. What were your thoughts on it? What changed in the third set?
F	You won Montral; made the semifinals here. How much better are you feeling about your US Open chances than you were two weeks ago?
F	Can you talk about her defense and where she might rate now in terms of best defensive players in the WTA?
F	A lot of people have compared her game to Caroline's, being more defensive and things. Are they similar or different? Can you compare the two?
F	Do you like playing another lefty or does it matter at all?
F	You played Li Na a week ago in the final in Montral and you played Angelique just now. Who has the advantage in the final?
F	In the second set what advice gave you your coach when he came to the court?
F	And what about the third set?
F	We saw you get quite frustrated on the court and stuff. Were you frustrated with tactically what you were trying to decide to do and you thought the tactics were wrong, or because you didn't execute the shot?
F	So New Haven?
F	So still going to play?
F	What's your favorite thing to do in New York when you're away from tennis?
F	Where?
F	Did you experience anything this week with your asthma or is it significantly better?
M	Nice to get on and off the court pretty quickly there?
M	Pretty obviously everyone here is getting ready for the Open. Does that change the way you play in a tournament like this? Are you just playing every point...
M	I guess I was thinking in terms of the timing of it because it's right before the Open.
M	That doesn't change the mindset of...
M	Mentally and physically, like comparing to last year, you know, here in Cincy and heading into the Open, how would you compare it?
M	Rafa is out of the US Open.
M	I'm not sure if you heard that.
M	Thoughts on that? It's surprising.
M	You've been playing well the last couple weeks.
M	Can you talk a little bit about some of the development in youth tennis in Australia. I know it's been a little bit of a drought since Lleyton.
M	You had a good Australian summer. Following up, looked like it was a little bit difficult resultwise. What do you attribute that to?
M	What is the key, like today? You could have lost the second set. What is the difference between actually doing that and winning compared to when you were unable to do that?
M	When you go into a match like this, do you think like he's going to be somebody you're going to be playing for a long time?
M	How far off do you think your generation is from the top four?
M	The last few years a lot of guys have said the speed of these courts in Cincinnati has been quick compared to other hard courts. Would you agree with that?
M	How long have you been with Nike?
M	How do you think they picked you?
M	Because you have so many different options in your game, does point construction become challenging sometimes?
M	How do you keep it simple for yourself?
M	Tennis is not a contact sport, but the lob today...
M	Have you sold the famous car?
M	Got a good price for it?
M	Which is what?
F	What a beast of a day for you. You had to change your warmup strip on the practice courts this morning, then you lose a major semifinal, and then you're the last player on court and you lose in doubles as well. Horrible day for you today.
F	In the second set you got your teeth into the match. What adjustments did you make and how proud are you of what you were able to do there?
F	Obviously she served so well, a record number of aces. What is it like to face that? What makes her serve so difficult?
F	There was a point in the second set where you got the break. If it went to a third, did you feel confident it could turn around?
F	Early part of the season was amazing. Are you feeling the early season is taking its toll, or are you still taking a tournament at a time?
F	Serena thought her intensity dropped a little in the second set. Is that a bit unkind or was it your intensity increased?
F	Is she as good a player as she's ever been right now?
F	Early in the match the crowd appeared to be laughing almost at some of the noises you make when you unleash your groundstrokes. Did you notice it at all? Did it upset you at all?
F	We've not noticed that happen on Centre Court here before.
F	I meant the crowd's reaction.
F	The semifinals is a good Wimbledon for you. What do you do next?
F	Who do you like in the final?
F	Which would give you more pleasure: going to your brother's wedding or playing in a Wimbledon final?
F	When you come back for the Olympics you can wear what you like. How do you think that affects the prestige of Wimbledon?
F	If you could have that match again, is there anything you'd do differently?
F	On set point at 45 there in the second set really a crucial turning point?
F	How has it felt being a Wimbledon champion here? Has it been difficult, the expectation? Do you find it a happy or difficult experience?
F	Did you feel under any pressure in this tournament because of that?
F	Did you sense that Serena was particularly keen to beat you because you were the defending champion? In the buildup she made a few comments she was quite looking forward to playing you because you had the title and we got the sense that she's very keen to get it back.
F	Do you think she'll win now?
F	When she's playing this sort of tennis, how would you describe the difficulty in doing anything against her, not just for you but for any of the players?
F	How difficult is it for anybody to beat her when she's playing like this?
F	Impossible?
F	Now that your title is gone, how does it feel? Obviously you're disappointed.
F	You have an excellent lefthanded serve, and it usually works very well against righthanded players against the backhand. She seemed to hit her backhand very, very well today. Is that your impression?
F	Have you traded in your Skoda?
F	What did you do with the other car?
F	I don't think I've ever seen someone smile so much on a tennis court.
F	Was it your game plan to be aggressive right from the very start?
F	Did you have any indication how well it would go for you today?
F	No nerves?
F	At what point of the match did you realize that the match was yours, that Maria was not coming back?
F	Is that revenge for last year?
F	How sweet does it feel?
F	You said on television that you like to play on grass so much. Could you tell us just a bit about what you feel are the main challenges that grass presents here at Wimbledon, and what about it suits your game?
F	As the tournament pressure increases as we get into it, what in general is your personal approach to pressure?
F	Can you describe your thoughts on facing someone from your home country in the next round.
F	Is there any reason that you can't win this tournament?
F	The commentators were complimentary about the power of your groundstrokes. Do you consider yourself to be one of the hardest hitters on the tour?
F	It all looks great, you're happy, the dialogue is going well. You had a lot of trouble with injuries and it's been a long way back for you, hasn't it?
M	Straight to the point. Lots of speculation with the way you walked off court. You think you may not be back here next year? Are you able to give us a definitive answer yet?
M	Not at all?
M	May I ask what is going through your mind at the moment, please?
M	How do you think your game was overall?
M	I thought it was going to be your day after the first set.
M	Are people reading too much into the kiss to the fans as you walked off court?
M	We've seen you in this room in a lot of different moods over the years. Usually after a loss you're pretty good most of the time. Today you seem more philosophical.
M	As far as the Olympics go, coming back here again, bestofthree, will be a different situation? How do you see your chances in that?
M	Is it the case that you have yet to make up your own mind?
M	You get a lot of love here. Do you sense that when you're going around town? Do people shout to you or anything?
M	So while it's never easy to see good things in a loss, it sounds like you're saying there's some things you learned positively about your game and where it's at in the last week or so.
M	Where do you go from here?
M	Mardy was just asked to talk about your legacy. He said you were the alpha male of your generation, and then he said the best grass court player ever not to have won here. Is that comment meaningless, like kissing your sister, or does it have any significance?
M	When you hear things like what Mardy Fish said and you think about your body of work, how do you feel about all that you've done to make yourself where you are right now? When you walk off the court and still have more to come back here, what drives you?
M	What sort of appreciation does that give you for a story like Brian Baker where he's battled through years of not even being able to do that sort of thing?
M	Shorter window. Mardy is in the fourth round after what he's gone through a few weeks ago. What do you think about that?
M	Given what you're saying about Brian, where you thought he could have been without the injuries, what do you think about his level now and what he could do going forward?
F	How difficult did you find the wind today?
F	Did you ever recall a serve before where the ball bounced before it got to the net?
F	Did you see any of the men's match last night?
F	What is your reaction?
F	Do you think it's harder as a player to take a loss like that when it's not expected?
F	I'm sorry to have to ask this question. I'm sure you get peppered with these questions all the time, but it's relevant because the opponent you play on Monday, Lisicki she moaned about her secondround opponent, Jovanovski, based on the amount of noise she made across the net. The noise was toned down. In a similar situation, would you talk to the umpire? Would you even react to it? Have you been in that situation before?
F	Are you progressing through the tournament?
F	I wanted to ask about your opponent today. It was the first time she played on No.1 Court. Were there elements of her game that surprised you?
F	Are you eager to wipe out your reputation as a clay court specialist?
F	Two weeks ago.
F	How has the transition been to grass, and how are you thinking now that you've mastered really all surfaces?
F	(No microphone.)
F	Ten aces. Very happy with it?
F	You're mentioned as one of the favorites. The Americans keep disappearing the first couple days. Do you feel a pressure to produce for the country as well as yourself? What is it like being in that situation?
F	How are you feeling physically in this tournament? It seems like maybe you're not stressed, but there's a lot going into every game, every match, and you're not yet at your loosest.
F	Sloane and Christina are both in this tournament. Can you talk about them as players and people.
F	As players, can you talk about their upsides a little bit?
F	Do they look up to you more for tennis advice or life advice?
F	Gilles Simon called for the end of equal prize money. Maria Sharapova was asked about it. She said the struggle was a long one that not many people supported. She added that a lot more people watch her matches than Simon's. Could you comment on that.
F	How far are you off your peak?
F	You looked a bit down today.
F	I heard you were one of the most romantic players on the tour. I wondered what someone could do to cheer you up at the moment?
F	What do you think about the grunting debate?
F	The Women's Tennis Association has said they're trying to phase it out. What do you think about that approach?
F	What flowers do you like?
F	You won't be able to move there will be that many people sending you roses.
F	Off the flowers for a second, do you consider serving first in a final set to be an advantage or not? If so, why?
F	Looking at the men's side of the tour where the three men have dominated the last slams for several years, what have you gained by watching them?
F	Tough opponent, but were you disappointed with your own performance?
F	Have you any idea why you weren't up to your best?
F	You started very slowly. Is there any particular reason for that? Were you nervous out there?
F	Was the wind a factor at all?
F	You would have been aware obviously of Heather's win on the same court yesterday at the same time. Did that impact at all on how you approached the game?
F	You're going to be back here in a few weeks' time. Does that fill you with excitement?
F	Is playing for your country very different to representing yourself, as it were?
F	What are you going to do in the time between now and the Olympics?
F	When will you get back then?
F	Did you reconsider that? Was that always going to be the plan, or did you think about it once you got there?
F	Do you get to stay in the Olympic Village and be part of the opening ceremony?
F	Where do you feel like your game is at the moment?
F	You say that you're super pumped up for the Olympics.
F	Forgive me, but you looked a little bit flat today at the start. Is that just my impression? Were you not super pumped up for Wimbledon?
M	Straightsset match, but didn't seem very straightforward. Could you talk us through it.
M	Encouraged coming in here after the last tournament, which you won, all the problems you've had, are you really looking forward now?
M	How bad would it be if his match doesn't finish today?
M	Does it change your physical performance?
M	Andy Murray was talking about how it was really hard for him to face the Olympics because he had gotten so close and didn't come through. He said he really respected you for coming back here after all you've been through and how close you've been. I wonder how you view it?
M	Jamie fought well and was aggressive. How impressed were you and how far do you think he can go?
M	What is your take on the way American tennis is not as strong as it used to be?
M	No major winner since 2003, which is quite a few years.
M	Barry MacKay has passed. Can you share a story you have?
M	Pretty cool that a tennis director was a former player? That was a plus in a certain way?
M	Mardy has had problems through a couple months. You've had your problems. Can you talk about your relationship, how you lean on each other.
M	You talked about many countries have not had Grand Slam winners in a while. How would you explain the dominant three players that have 28 of the last 29 Grand Slams?
M	You passed the 600 win mark. You've often talked about stats. Just wondered what you feel about that and do you feel like after Queen's this is sort of a second season for you?
M	In talking about the top three players, you spoke about their mental toughness. Can you break that down a little bit.
M	You talked about having relationships with tournaments, going to them each year. What small things do you enjoy when you come here?
M	Back to the top three again. Are you pleased you've played in this era with those three players, or would you have liked to have come at a different time and won a few more slams?
M	You alluded to the Olympic experience being a different experience. Can you describe what the Olympics mean to you.
M	Are you at the point in your career where you can go on court, play your best, fight, come off without the W, and still be satisfied?
M	At this moment in your career, which victory means more than ever for you?
M	How disappointing is that?
M	You're saying no excuses, but physically how were you? You seemed to clutch your back a few times and looked a little bit out of sorts.
M	What was he doing that you couldn't seem to stay focused on?
M	Last year you were the golden boy coming through and getting through the quallies and into the quarters and getting a set off Djokovic; now this year, you know, he qualified as a lucky loser at Roland Garros and played all the way to the round of 16 and got a set off Federer. Does it feel like you guys have exchanged places? Turned the table?
M	The racquet obviously took a pounding. Was that today the frustration or was it three weeks' worth of frustration building up?
M	You didn't seem too thrilled that three times umpiring errors turned winners into replays.
M	Is that something you learn to deal with, the frustration, you have to channel it in rather than take it out on the racquet?
M	The balance you talk about, how does the coaching situation feed into that?
M	This is the first big tournament where you've had a lot to defend. Did you feel that was a burden, and did it play any role in your performances?
M	Your whole career has been up and up and up. Now that you have a lull here, how are your confidence levels?
M	No, I'm just saying is this a setback for you or you take it as sort of a blip?
M	You mentioned not working hard enough. Why is that the case?
M	Is that a lack of motivation in some way then? Can't sort of bring yourself to practice as hard as you know you need to?
M	Such a talented ballstriker. Does that make it more difficult to sort of grind when you have to grind or...
M	So were you frustrated with your game even coming into this Wimbledon tournament? You kind of felt frustrated even before you went out on court?
M	Can you take any motivation out of the fact you can come back here in a couple weeks during the Olympics and do what you wanted to do here and what you like to do on grass?
M	Another chance?
M	Were you thinking when you got back here it would all fall into place?
M	Is the problem you think the way you've been training or sometimes you've just not trained? You find other things to do?
M	In terms of outside influences, Davis Cup coaching scenarios, you respond a certain way in your private situation. What do you find is best for you?
M	Comparing Davis Cup and preparing for ties compared to this, what's better for you: having someone like Pat Rafter around? Do you respond to that kind of thing?
M	Has your dad, your coach, been frustrated or annoyed at you for what you have admitted which is sort of a lack of application of training?
M	Do you remember the last time you played him four years ago?
F	Happy girl?
F	You didn't know till she told you that?
F	Can you tell us what that wildcard means.
F	So last night what was weighing on your mind? This match was weighing on your mind and that?
F	Can you describe the moments after the match, how you were told, and exactly what the conversation was, please.
F	(Off microphone.)
F	You said about the neck thing, is it fair to say it's been a difficult few weeks?
F	The tears were tears of frustration and all that?
F	When you look back at the photos and the video of the moment you were told by Judy Murray, what do you think you'll feel in your head and your heart?
F	Petra Kvitova is up next. You think that's going to be on Centre Court?
F	Can you remind us if you've played there much before, what do you feel about possibly being on that court?
F	Have you found this is a place that's lifted you in the past because of the crowd support, or it has actually daunted you?
F	And quite a way to end your career possibly. I know you've said in the past this might be your final year.
F	What do you remember your feelings were when you watched either in person or on TV when Kvitova won last year and was celebrating in the post match?
F	You had some treatments. What was the problem?
M	How are you feeling about that? Obviously you had your chances, didn't you? Is it very frustrating?
M	You must have thought you were on for a decent match after the first set, because you broke him twice even after losing your own serve.
M	Does how upset you are sort of show us what you think of your ability in a nice way? You're upset because you think you should be able to win a game like that even though your ranking is obviously a million miles apart at the moment.
M	In a sense, does your determination actually growI know it's difficult a half hour after the match, but your determination to get better and get stronger and get more used to these kind of matches and be out there again, does it grow after a situation like this?
M	What especially were you satisfied with? You served very well at certain stages. I know you had a double here or there and that's to be expected almost. Were you pleased with certain elements of your game today?
M	When we hopefully see you again this time next year, what are the two or three things that you really need to do to take you over that ledge? Because like you say, you were just so close.
M	That double fault on set point, is that the sort of point you'll be playing over and over again in your mind?
M	What's your schedule now? Doubles here or back to the futures?
M	There is quite a camaraderie amongst you guys. Is that quite helpful?
M	How did it compare to being on the West End?
M	Did you come together a bit more in the second set with the way your game was working?
M	How much of a step up do you think of playing a Grand Slam champion?
M	We all seem to be saying this is Davis Cup year, but you've got all the potential, you've got all the shots. It's just getting up there among these quality players, isn't it?
M	Do you have any sort of target for the rest of the year in terms of your ranking, for example?
M	Do you prefer playing against this quality opposition than some of the players you play against away from the limelight?
M	If you can reproduce the form you have shown, especially the first two matches here, are you confident in qualifying next week?
M	Do you just put that down to knuckling down a bit more?
M	Just looking at Davis Cup, Andy has said he will play in September. Would it be a particular target of yours to try and force your way in there as the second singles player?
M	I think I am right in saying that Magnus is leaving the LTA in the summer. Do you think getting some kind of coaching stability is also an important thing for you to have in the next six months, a year or so?
M	Who else do you work with? There are times he's not there, so who else do you work with?
F	You looked like you had more problems with the wind today than before.
F	Sum up your week here for us.
F	You take a lot of positives out of it?
F	Eight games in eight days. You only have to play seven games to win Wimbledon. Were you tired today?
F	Is it the adrenaline that's keeping you going?
F	So tell us about your mindset now. You are obviously meeting Sloane. How are you going to approach?
F	Have you played each other a lot?
F	So it's even?
F	What advice was your coaching giving you when he came onto the courts?
F	Will you come back again to Eastbourne?
F	Even if they make you play through a cloud?
F	Your thoughts on that match.
F	When we were in Paris you were saying you were working piecemeal on bits of your serve. Have you seen any improvement since coming back?
F	You seemed the more attacking player out of the two of you out there. Was that the game plan, to try to take the game to her?
F	What can you take out of this week going into next week at Wimbledon?
F	Was there anything today that you thought that Caroline did that made it difficult for you especially?
F	When you play Caroline, obviously she's so good defensively. Do you feel a little bit of extra pressure to put those balls away that sit up? Does it put a bit more pressure on you because she's so good at getting them back?
F	Would you have hoped for a different opponent?
F	Obviously emotions run high. I have to ask, the BBC microphones picked up you swearing on court. Do you have anything to say?
F	Again I have to ask, people said that were obviously watching, they said that you rushed off and didn't sign any autographs afterwards.
F	You've played a lot of big players on big courts now in the last year, so in terms of the draw next week, would you be very happy to avoid one of the big names on the big courts and have a slightly more comfortable path at the beginning?
F	That must be very encouraging, the fact that your end points, the way you're dictating the points, yet you didn't put away the final shot today but you're in that position?
F	Do you ever sometimes think, wow, I'm one of the top 50 or whatever players in the world?
F	Is the overriding emotion frustration now after that? You were ahead in each set, and then is it frustration what you feel now?
F	Yeah.
F	Possibly looking a little too far ahead, you have Wimbledon to contend with, you were so close to get a seeding. Is the goal now to get a seeding for the US Open, or you just take it as it comes?
F	She doesn't like playing you.
F	Why do you think you match up so well against her?
F	What do you think you did well today?
F	Were you concerned when you served for the first set, she broke you, she then had a set point. Were you concerned at all?
F	I think this was your sixth grass match already.
F	So in terms of making the transition from clay to the grass, how has it been so far? Obviously the win is great. How are you feel out there, and do you get the sense that your game is translating well?
F	Can you look back on obviously 2013 has been pretty incredible. So when you look back on it, is there a single match that you can look back and say whether you won or lost that was the one that gave you the confidence to be able to pull off these top 10, top 5 wins?
F	You came through qualifying, got hosed a little bit getting the top seed even though you were the top seed there. Are you looking at the draws now and saying, like, I'm excited to take on this challenge as opposed to like Oh, my goodness, I've kind of got screwed by the draw a little bit?
F	How is Twitter going?
F	Who talked you into it?
F	Madison is peeved that you got on Twitter before she did.
F	Almost like the win by a thousand cuts, all those match points? How did you feel out there?
F	You were quite aggressive on occasions out there, a bit of volleying. Must be pretty happy with your game.
F	Can you talk about the first game where you tried to serve it out, the first three match points? You were maybe getting a bit aggressive and seemed like you were getting frustrated because you weren't hitting the ball as much, no?
F	You had a hard time with her on hard courts last year in the matches. Why did you turn it around today?
F	Are you the kind of person that enjoys a lot of matches, a lot backtoback matches? I guess to go through and win the Australian Open you're looking at 16 matches in a row.
F	Obviously that's a lot of matches and obviously something you contemplate. Is that something that suits well for you? Some players here in particular, you get a feeling that they play a few games and take it easy, lose, or drop out to save yourselves. But that's not the case for you?
F	Do you see yourself as maybe a little bit below Serena? I suppose with the win in Auckland, here, that maybe in some people's reckoning you're going to that second tier, maybe the second level of favorites below Serena?
F	So you've never won backtoback tournaments before?
F	Li Na says she's trying some new things to strengthen her game. Did you sense any change at all compared to the last couple matches you played her?
F	She says she is trying to be more aggressive and come to the net a little more. Do you see that?
F	Also talk about the shot between the legs.
F	Is that typical for a woman player to do that?
F	How is the body holding up? This is two weeks of constant matches. Are you feeling fatigued physically?
F	You've improved so many things in your game  first serve, forehand  over the last few years. Do you think it's possible to add speed to your second serve, and is that something you work on?
F	Would you change your game much from the way you played today if you were playing Serena or Maria or Victoria?
F	The basic principles of how aggressive you are though, were you happy with that game today? Do you think it would match up well against the top 3?
F	Are you okay with the crowd yelling your name, Go Aggie? Australians like to shorten names.
F	People have called you Angie?
F	Where?
F	Your match was televised in Poland for the first time this season. How important to you is it is that your fans can watch back home?
F	The tournament in Poland, the report says that you couldn't play because you already play Auckland last week. What's the situation?
F	Words on either Angelique Kerber or Dominika? You will face one of them in the final. Just a couple words about each player, what you like about their game.
F	Do you think you should be allowed to play in Poland? I know what the rule is, but given that the tournament came in late, did you think they would make an exception for you?
F	So you asked and they said no?
F	You asked the tour?
F	Internationals in six months?
F	They said no?
F	Who said no? Do you know?
F	When did you hear that there was going to officially be a tournament there?
F	So after you made your schedule?
F	Did you work harder on offseason serve and volley and coming to the net more? Because today when I was watching you attack more and you were coming more to the net. So her game allows you to do that?
F	Seem to be very comfortable.
F	Heat or form? Was that a combination of hit or how you're playing?
F	The result, was it a result of it being so hot or partially on your form?
F	Are you a fan of the WTA policy to allow breaks at the end of a second set?
F	Seemed like during the match you were playing really well at times, not so well at times, getting frustrated, you were happy. Sort of up and down, no?
F	Svetlana, because of her injury last year, her ranking has really dropped, and therefore, there is a prospect that anyone of you could meet her first round next week in Melbourne. How will the leading players be thinking about that possibility with her in the draw?
F	She's playing much better than 72 or whatever her ranking is.
F	Honestly, confidencewise going into Melbourne where you?
F	Coming into this season were you happy with the offseason? Are you happy with your style right now, or do you feel a little bit in between being the old Caroline, defensive wall, and the newer Caroline, being more aggressive on certain points?
F	Have you played a match where you felt hotter than today?
F	I was out there, and it was hot as hell out there and I was sitting in the shade. Do you think there comes a time where there should be like the cricketers stop playing when it's raining do you think there should be a temperature cut off?
F	Do you think play should have been postponed today until later tonight even?
F	You've been on tour now a number years. Are you making the decisions during the matches as to strategy and how you want to play, or when your dad comes on court is he saying, This is what I want you to do and then you try to follow?
F	You talked about needing to get your consistency back. How does someone like you lose something like that, because it was such a strength of your?
F	Do you feel it's inevitable to be back in the top 5 this year?
F	How is the ankle and how is the head?
F	How much did the falls affect you afterwards? Did it affect your play?
F	Did the falls affect you.
F	The second fall was right after the fireworks. Do you think having that break was a factor in you falling over again?
F	Although you'll be disappointed now, you must be very satisfied with the twoweek campaign that you've had.
F	Are you enjoying your tennis more at the moment than you were 12 months ago?
F	Do you think without falling down you would have won today?
F	Did you feel like you were in a very good position at that time?
F	Didn't you feel like coming into the match, after beating Maria the way you did, if you played your best you could win?
F	Could you feel the bulk of the stadium was behind you tonight?
F	Have you ever had a crowd that big in your favor before? Have you felt that?
F	Does this loss hurt more than the 2011 final?
F	It seemed like after the loss in 2011 you were a little more happy. After this one, a few more tears.
F	Besides falling down those two times, were you happy or satisfied with the level of your play throughout the match?
F	Were you happy with your play today in the match?
F	After the match you made reference to your age. How long do you think you can keep going on for?
F	Why do you think you fell down?
F	There was a controversy in the semifinal between Sloane Stephens regarding medical timeouts.
F	Was that going through your head a little bit?
F	Have you had the chance to talk to Carlos? If so, what has he said to you after the match?
F	The last time you lost the Australian Open final you went on and won the French Open not long after. Do you think you have the motivation to take this further and keep going from here?
F	Your emotions, where are you at at the moment?
F	How is the physical injury? How is the back?
F	You were serving at about 130 kilometer an hour after the back problem. What exactly happened? Was it tight?
F	That point where it happened, can you talk us through that moment.
F	When you went off court, what sort of treatment did you have? Did you take any antiinflammatories?
F	Did it feel better when you came back on? Were you freer?
F	The microphones on court picked up you saying this has been the worst two weeks. What did you mean by that?
F	Is it the worst couple weeks you've had at a Grand Slam?
F	Did you ever think about retiring at any point?
F	Did you get the sense Sloane was freaking out a bit towards the end of the second set, just the drama of it all, the injury and everything else, and it was quite hard for her to push through?
F	Could you tell us what you think of her as a player and how far she's going to push on from here.
F	What did you think of the quality of the match before you tweaked the back?
F	Obviously your serve speed went way down when you had the injury. You started to work your way back in the match in the third set. How much of that were you fighting yourself and how much were you fighting injury in that third set?
F	Yesterday in the game you also hurt a little bit. I want to know before the game today, what did you think about it? Have you ever worried about your injuries?
F	Just think about it, think about the injury and worry about that.
F	Did you get some frustrations out with that racquet smash?
F	You were in Mauritius for some preparation. That is my home town. How did it go there?
F	You mentioned being relieved, this being a difficult two weeks. It's been a long time since you've lost a match. Does the pressure build up? Does it become more and more difficult to keep it going?
F	Do you think she's quiet in the game?
F	In last several games you said, You should grunt. She's a little bit quiet. Also as a mentor for her  she thinks of you as a mentor  in the future, will you give her some advice?
F	You were such a favorite for the tournament. How do you see it now on the women's side? Who do you see progressing to Saturday?
F	Is that No.1 ranking of big importance to you? If it's going elsewhere now, does that add to the disappointment or not really?
F	What did you do better than when you played her a week ago?
F	I think at the start of the second set you lost about eight points in a row and then the next five games you turned it around. What did you do?
F	Do you feel calmer on the court these days, and why do you think you're feeling more calm?
F	This is your third semifinal here in four years. Why do you think this is your best slam? This seems to be your best slam. Do you agree?
F	Why do you think it is?
F	Do you think it being the beginning of the year also helps for you?
F	I'm saying you work hard in the offseason.
F	Knowing that you won a Grand Slam, do you feel like this could be your best chance again to maybe win and do better than you've done in the past and go all the way?
F	You said on court that Carlos was training pretty harshly in the offseason.
F	What sort of stuff was he doing to you? How difficult was the preseason?
F	Did you think about quitting at some point, stopping your work with him?
F	Maria Sharapova has only lost five games in her first four matches. Have you been able to see any of her? What do you think about playing somebody who is playing that well?
F	If you play her, who do you think Max will root for?
F	What happened with that serve?
F	Do you think you're enjoying tennis again? It seemed after you won the French Open there was a lot of pressure; last year you had a tough match here. Are you feeling happier?
F	On court you mentioned since your husband stopped coaching you you have a better family life. Could you tell us a bit more about that.
F	You played Maria three times last year. I think she won all three matches. Where do you think you've improved and where do you think she's improved in the last few months if you do play her on Thursday?
M	A strange match in some respects. You realized that Gilles' condition wasn't great. How did you approach it?
M	Are you quite happy in the fact you got the job done pretty efficiently?
M	Any concern you haven't been as tested as much as you would have liked?
M	What do you recall about the Chardy match? Did you see any of it today? The Cincinnati match.
M	Did you watch much of Novak's match last night?
M	You're aware of the story this morning suggesting the male players may boycott the US Open due to issues over prize money and a Monday final.
M	Heard in the locker room or...
M	You're playing another Frenchman now. He beat you the last time you played in Cincinnati. Considering that you were not in your best shape after the Olympic Games, does it make any significance for you?
M	Yes.
M	Would you support a boycott of the US Open if it came to that?
F	Can you take us through the tiebreaker. You were down. What was going through your head?
F	So overall you're happy with your performance today?
F	How do you feel about playing Ivanovic or Radwanska? Who do you prefer to play?
F	Can you talk about what you've done in your off time. Yesterday Kei Nishikori went to make some sushi. Have you done anything interesting in Melbourne?
F	Can you explain to us what happened there in the first set. Had you arrived with a problem or did it happen within the match?
F	How much did it affect you on your serve, what you could do with your first serve?
F	Quite a long discussion during the medical timeout. Did you consider pulling out?
F	Do you feel this match was any different than the one in Hobart?
F	Would we be wrong to assume that this is just the initial stages of a long series of the two of you playing against one another?
F	You're both going right up the rankings.
F	When the trainer was with you, did they know where you hurt? Looked like you were in a lot of distress all down the lefthand side.
F	The question is, what was the extent of that pain? It looked like you were in some considerable pain.
F	What did you think of the support you got out on court today?
F	There were some people saying they forced themselves to go watch the Seppi and Cilic match before yours to make sure they could have a seat for yours. Were you surprised to be on such a small court?
F	What time did you get to sleep after Kvitova and what was the rest day like?
F	When did the shoulder start to become an issue?
F	After some practice, or did it just come on?
F	How does the week sit with you overall?
F	You say there are a lot of things you can work on. What in particular?
F	Is the shot selection a particular issue playing somebody like Sloane who gets so many balls back?
F	Do you think the shoulder pain is just the result of having played 119 in the third the day before, or is it something more serious?
F	Is next up Fed Cup or anything in between?
M	What is the camera for?
M	I wanted to know if you feel like these long matches are actually an advantage for you. Seems like you're playing a lot of them at the moment.
M	Maybe you're really fit at the moment, so...
M	Do you train specifically for the heat or is it mainly stamina for five sets?
M	I'm not sure if you saw today, but Lance Armstrong admitted to playing performanceenhancing drugs. I was wondering if you thought tennis had a vigorous enough policy on antidoping?
F	She played a little bit like a very talented but crazy junior. You had to stay in there with her.
F	Did you expect her to miss as much as she did or did you feel like you had to force the play and control it a little bit more?
F	Did she make you feel old, knowing she's the same age as when you played first?
F	You've talked about the fun. Obviously the sport is more fun when you're winning. Was it fun today?
F	How pleased were you with the consistency of your ball striking today? It looked pretty impressive.
F	You hit some big serves at times. It's an important part of your game. You've been working on it for a few years. If you get in tight matches, you need to come up with that.
F	Is it a little frustrating that last year you were asked about the pressure to back up being No.1 by winning a major, now you're asked about the pressure to get back to No.1.
F	The golf colleague out there.
F	Someone else's golf who might be playing well at the moment.
F	You said on the court you were at the physio's and you were by far the oldest person in there.
F	Are you the oldest youngest player on tour now?
F	Do you actually feel a generational difference at 22 to a 16 or 17yearold?
F	They're playing a lot of music. You have no idea? You feel like an old person, that I don't know that?
F	Obviously a disappointing way to finish after fighting back.
F	Was there a problem with the ankle and the balance with the serve? No problem there?
F	What were you thinking when you were 52 up coming out to serve?
F	Did you find your body language changed during that game?
F	How much of it was mental as opposed to physical?
F	Do you think you choked?
F	What was going through your mind at 52 in the third and your opponent getting those games back?
F	When you say crazy things come into your head, what do you think? Like, It's not happening again?
F	You pride yourself on fitness. You said a couple times here that you're tired early in the third set. Is your fitness lower than what it should be?
F	Where to from here? When people ask you, why is it difficult here, why is it difficult at your home slam, what are you going to say when you get stopped in the supermarket?
F	Are you planning to have any changes in your game, anything specific to do with what is happening now?
F	Can you draw any positives out of the game?
F	Every time facing Zheng, you think if you couldn't take early control in the game and letting her establish in the rallies, you're going to be in trouble, you're going to be struggling a little bit?
F	Do you feel surprised that Zheng Jie could fight back with such big disadvantages, like two breaks behind and, 25 down in the third set?
F	Do you know something about your Polish roots? If I'm not mistaken, your grandfather was a Polish soldier.
F	Can you read or speak any Polish?
F	Have you been watching Bernard Tomic's game, and do you have any observations on his game?
M	What happened in the first set? Obviously not your finest hour.
M	You did have stretches of playing reasonably well, I thought.
M	And the second serve on the set point in the fourth set, just another day at the office?
M	Did that affect you at all, the fact that you hit a let on the previous serve?
M	Do you blame any of the erratic play on the pretty windy conditions?
M	How do you explain not moving the arms?
M	So it's Rosol or Jamie Baker.
M	Rosol is he anything but a guy that had one phenomenal performance?
M	And what did you think of him today? Steady at certain times.
M	Trying to incorporate a few new things into your game this year. I guess you weren't too successful with that today.
F	I take it the rust didn't hurt too much out there?
F	You have now gotten a double bagel win at every slam. It completes your double bagel slam or calendar slam. Is that something you're proud of?
F	You don't get any extra satisfaction out of 00?
F	Did you take anything from today as far as what you want to work on maybe the next couple of days as far as you felt like you did something really well or that you weren't necessarily happy with?
F	You got through round one in 55 minutes without losing a game. Must be a wonderful feeling for you. Are you already aware that Venus Williams played five more minutes and lost only one game?
F	You aren't aware that you may have to face her in the third round?
F	On the court it's cold or hot?
F	What's your feeling?
F	Yeah, I watched.
F	Cold.
F	What were your thoughts on the match today?
F	Does that give you confidence moving forward?
F	Is it part of being in that situation of being a set up, nerves of being in the Australian Open, come into play today?
F	What sort of lesson can you take from a match like that?
F	Big crowd play into your nerves today?
F	Are you going to go away and have a look at that game?
F	Are you still happy you still have a chance to get out in front of the home crowd playing doubles?
F	What are your goals for 2013 now?
M	How are you? Maybe I make a mistake, but I have the impression you were a little bit tired with your legs.
M	Talking about your personal situation, family and so on, is good. That helps your game or you need more independence? If your personal life is okay, in the court, it can make you a better player, performer?
M	Can you compare this season, which has been by your standards, unsuccessful in terms of winning trophies and tournaments, compared to those five years when you were at the top. Is winning right now difficult wins, are they more valuable now compared to when you were absolutely untouchable?
M	About the Viktor Troicki case. Novak said he doesn't trust the antidoping system any more, WADA. Is this a general feeling among the players? What do you think about it?
M	Yes.
M	I know obviously this tournament isn't done yet. In the offseason, you're not doing South America this year. Are you doing more of a conventional offseason?
M	Presumably that has cost you quite a bit of money because they'd like you back in South America, but you've foregone that to do a more conventional offseason.
M	One more question on drug testing. In Troicki's case, his problem seemed to be that he wasn't aware of how serious the consequences were of not doing the test that day, of coming back the following day. In your experience, are the players told clearly enough that if you're called for a test, you must do it that day?
M	I think now if you beat Juan, you'll definitely be through to the last four. You've played each other twice very recently. How much confidence do you take from the Paris win?
M	David, tough loss today. You were leading in both sets. What do you think he did well against you today?
M	I'm just wondering, with being up a break late in both sets, when you come to this moment, is it more mental for you, the occasion of being so close?
M	Obviously a lot of people think of you as being best on clay court. Your best results are indoors the last few years.
M	Novak has been saying that he's trying to improve his game, especially at the net. Is that something you noticed, and to what extent has he improved?
M	How are you feeling in terms to fatigue and your fitness heading to London? How are you going to approach London?
M	You've got a very tough stretch of matches, starting with Rafa guaranteed in London. Rafa, Djokovic, then Rafa again. That's not normal. How are you going to deal with that?
M	Are you thinking, That's it, it's holidays now after this difficult season, or are you very disappointed with that match still?
M	What is the worst thing for you in Ferrer's game? His forehand?
M	Now are you going to try to do the same next year?
M	It's been two years you had many injuries or health problems. Aren't you going to dedicate the winter break to work on your physical condition?
M	It's often that the injuries that you have are a problem of having tight muscles.
M	To be more relaxed, you could try yoga or sophrology. Some players do that. Why don't you try?
M	Do you know how to release those tensions?
M	At one set all, how did you feel and how were you able to win it?
M	Are you surprised by yourself playing that kind of a match at the end of a season?
M	Were you frustrated you couldn't play these last days? You were injured?
M	Did you think about it when you were playing?
M	Are you always taken by surprise?
M	A detail about the racquet. We saw you fiddling with your racquet.
M	Is it the same for you to play Jo or Nishikori?
M	Are you playing the match to qualify for the quarterfinal here or for being qualified for the Masters?
M	You should be relieved, but apparently you seem a bit upset.
M	Playing a match that is almost a final on Thursday is something incredible, isn't it?
M	(Off microphone.)
M	Do you feel now like an old, experienced player on the tour?
M	There was more people today than the other night, eh?
M	Perfect performance for you, but at the same time maybe Jo not up to what you expected?
M	You have been here in America, I don't know, 10 days or so, and you come here all the time. What do you like best about American culture, American life? Just reflect on that. Do you think your country could learn anything from what we do?
M	You just said you felt you played well today. If you have to break it down, what pleased you the most and were there any aspects of today's match that you might change?
M	As you say, he made a lot of unforced errors. In some ways, would you prefer to have more of a workout heading into the semifinals?
M	Historically some players have had trouble sort of being No.1, back to Wilander and even Pete for a while and some of the women. Could you talk about just being No.1, what's great about it? Is there anything that's not so great?
M	Maybe a little word on Rafa who is playing on hard court for the first time in almost a year and already in the semis and having not played in seven months. Are you impressed or did you sort of expect it considering who he is?
M	Obviously you don't know who you're going to play. As we need something to preview the next round, can you preview both potential opponents?
M	Obviously you faced Jo Willy's serve today which is pretty tough. If you have to say three or four toughest strokes that you face out there on the circuit, what are the really toughest strokes that you have to handle?
F	I think some of us were worried before the match how you're going to handle the heat. It's pretty hot today. But you seemed to come through very well. How did you feel out there?
F	Do you have to change sort of the way you approach your workouts or your day or anything when it goes from being sort of mild and temperate to hot like it is now the next few days?
F	Since the US Open last year you have been playing very well on outdoor hard courts. Can you say why?
F	Is it all physical or was there a point where you thought, Well, mentally I know I'm not going to feel well so maybe I'm not going to play my best?
F	You went and won Wimbledon and got a lot of attention, and it seems like now more recently you're kind of flying under the radar maybe with less attention. Do you prefer that, or do you kind of miss getting...
F	You didn't have the big title last year, but you won Fed Cup. So I'm wondering, do you feel like that kind of experience helped you coming into this season, or is there no relation?
F	Yeah.
F	What about for you coming here? You had the upset last year, you lost early, so does it give you that extra boost of confidence now to be into the quarterfinals?
F	You have talked a lot about how important consistency is for you, so what do you do to keep yourself consistent week to week?
F	So there were times when you were playing lower players when you weren't able to focus as much maybe because you thought, I should win this?
F	You're in the quarterfinals now; do you think you're ready to win this tournament?
F	The surface here is a bit slow, no? But the weather is hot and the balls maybe are lighter. Does it suit you? Is it fast in some ways and slow in others?
M	You seemed pretty emotional at the end of the match. Was it a little emotional?
M	You sound almost surprised that you found out you still wanted to win in the third set.
M	Demons is the word you use with some repetition. Is it just fears? Is it anxiety? Did you feel them out there on court?
M	In a real match, was it different from playing Novak? That was a great experience, too?
M	How do you feel now after this match? Do you feel good? Normal?
M	Would you have preferred not to be on the main stadium today, or did you request that?
M	You have talked about trying to limit your stress doing things like not worrying about other people's rankings. Could you just talk about that process? It's not always an easy thing to do to tamp down.
M	But it's not from the rankings?
M	Do you think that having the situation like running your own XO in LA and being locked in to play there was something you needed to force yourself to get back on the court?
M	Do you think going forward past this tournament it's going to be easier to bring yourself to...
M	Where are you in terms of planning? Have you got a longrange schedule, or is it going to be just kind of assess it after each event?
M	What was the overwhelming kind of reaction after the match? Was it pride or relief? Elation?
M	Is there anything special you implemented in your program right now that you haven't done in the past just to deal with the circumstances of your comeback?
M	What about diet? Nothing unusual?
M	You were talking about demons. How hard is it during a match to put those sorts of things out of your mind and to just concentrate on the job at hand? And the second part, from what you were just saying about assessing the situation after Miami, is there a possibility that you might feel you need to walk away from playing?
M	On a more serious front, in the past you have talked about how you have spoiled your dog crazy. Has it been fun? Have you really gone crazy spoiling the dog and all that?
M	Is he the one who scratched you?
M	Irish Spring?
M	There are many athletes who have been at the top reaches of their sport, they're unwilling  when you have been at the top it's not much fun. It's better to just retire because it's not much fun being unranked. Are you the kind of guy who would just like to play out here no matter what, or if you can't make quarters or semis, would it be...
M	Some of us were a little bit shocked when your good friend Roddick retired back at the US Open.
M	Just talk a little bit about that. You have known him since you were a kid. Being on the tour without him around must be...
M	Would you be stunned by a comeback, if he came back?
M	Why?
M	Would it have been easier to come back sooner if you knew he was going to be there? Does not having one of your friends there make it harder to jump back in?
M	On a more general note, Ryan Harrison and Jack Sock are out already. It's not the best of times. Could you just talk about the young American players? Pretty much the standard question. Do you think things can kick start...
M	You said you were looking to hit the groundstrokes more cleanly. Felt like you definitely did that today.
M	Probably going to Melbourne feeling about as happy as you could, really.
M	You seem to be your own worst critic sometimes. You're a great player. There were times in the match when it seemed to be going against you and your body language looks like you're getting hard on yourself. What goes through your mind and how do you overcome that to go on and succeed?
M	You won Brisbane last year and had a wonderful season. Could this be a good omen?
M	Obviously it was a very private thing, but you made a dedication of the trophy on court. Can you tell us who, or is it just a sick friend, a friend that's going through a tough time?
M	What did Grigor show you today?
M	Is playing him similar to playing Roger Federer?
M	When you won the toss you chose to receive. What was the reasoning behind that?
M	You made slow starts in your last two matches. Are you concerned the all looking ahead to Melbourne?
M	Was there anything in the offseason you focused on more intently where you thought, Going into 2013, if I improve this it's really going to help me get out of some tough spots or beat the other guys more consistently?
M	You've won backtoback in Brisbane. Coming back to defend your title next year?
M	Melbourne is going to be the first slam you've gone into with a Grand Slam title. Does that give you any more confidence? A little bit more swagger?
M	You've got a growing reputation as a great returner of serve. Grigor thought you read him very well today. Is that something you've worked on in the last few years?
M	It's been a year since Ivan joined your team. Can you sum up what influence he's had.
M	You obviously like coming down here. What is it about Australia that makes you produce these results?
M	You didn't look like you had any trouble today.
M	It's been a little while since you won a title. Do you think this could be one leading up to the Open?
M	You've got a new add addition to your family, we read. Are you traveling together, or how are you coping?
M	The prize money for the Australian Open has gone up considerably in the lower rounds. It's as a result of player power really. What do you think of that? Do you think it's a good thing for the game that there is more money for the...
M	More prize money?
M	Do you think it makes it more economically viable for more players to compete?
M	So it'll make life a little bit easier if you're qualifying for the majors to break even or make money during the year?
M	Patrick Mouratoglou was involved in your grand campaign here, and now he's working with Serena. What sort of the impact do you think he's having with her?
M	So he doesn't have any unusual techniques?
F	How much confidence does that give you just the way you fought back today?
F	In your preparation for a major, is it better to have such a tight result like that than to sweep through pretty easily?
F	Was it a pretty big surprise? You really didn't know what that expect today?
F	What was the most difficult? Her serve?
F	Talk about that breakback game in the third set. You said you were down 14. You held your serve and then won that massive rally to get back in. What were you thinking at that stage?
F	Your opponent today had a powerful serve, but it was hard to tell when it was coming. How did you manage that?
F	Can you talk a little bit about your impression of Madison? She's sort of a very promising youngster in the tour. Do you think she's someone others need look out for in coming years?
F	Also, about your own performance today, seems like your movement is much better than it was in Tokyo; do you feel that way?
F	When it comes down the end of the season, obviously the goal is to try to finish as high as possible. What's the goal for you right now? You want to do well in China Open and the Championships?
F	Have you ever thought of participating in doubles with your sister?
F	Thoughts on the match today, Aga?
F	And the 36 unforced errors, kind of a little high for you. Part of that, Voegele, she was really aggressive off your serve. How were you able to combat that and win those last two sets?
F	Seems that you're not satisfied with your performance on the court. Sometimes you're even trying to throw off the racquet. Can you comment on your performance to control your emotions or mood on the court today?
M	Do you have a medical report?
M	Muscle in the neck?
M	Kind of went away?
M	Two Canadians in the final eight in the tournament since 1989. Your thoughts on that?
M	You against Del Potro, what were the keys to success?
M	You arrive here not on a hot streak, and now everything seems to go your way.
M	Two Canadians maybe in the semifinal if everything goes well. A few years ago it would have been impossible to think about.
M	DelPo was upset in the second set, felt you touched the net. What was your view of that point?
M	He seemed to think you should have called it on yourself.
M	But it was his point.
M	It hasn't been easy for you lately. How does it feel to be at the top again?
M	How do you explain the difference between a couple months ago and how you're playing right now?
M	The neck thing, is that something that is going to be a concern for tomorrow and possibly after that for the rest of this tournament?
M	Did it just come up today?
M	It's a quick turnaround for tomorrow. You're on at 2 p.m. You've always played during the night. Would you have preferred to play during the night?
M	The court is quicker in the day?
M	How many more miles per hour?
M	Does the ball go faster through the air, too?
M	You must be pleased. First match since Wimbledon in singles.
M	How does the fact that you came in early help you adjust to the hard court, that you've been here since Wednesday?
M	It's been eight years since you beat Agassi here for your first hard court victory. Does that seem like a long time ago or does it feel like it happened yesterday?
M	The last time you played on hard was Indian Wells. You won it. Then you pulled out of Miami because too much tennis on hard is not very good for the body, I understand.
M	This being said, hard court here, Cincinnati, US Open, how do you feel about a lot of tennis on this surface for the body?
M	How are you feeling physically?
M	How long was the wait since your last game? How anxious were you to get back on the court?
M	Have you had any reaction when you heard that Roger has changed to a bigger racquet?
M	You're playing doubles here. You played quite a bit of doubles before with success. Do you play largely for the pleasure of playing doubles or does it really sharpen your game?
M	Was there anything in your game today that you would have liked to improve for the next game?
M	You've had a lot of success in firstround matches, 13 out of 14 this year now. Happy with the way you're playing, very consistently?
M	How did you find the court today?
M	How is the return to hard court? Your clay season wasn't all too good. How is the return to hard courts? Is it better for you, or...
M	To the surface.
M	How do you like here, Montral?
M	Any preferences for the next round?
M	Looked easy until the end.
M	Would you read too much into the fact that when you're serving out the match you have a game like that?
M	Does that help you, getting at sort of a close second set, for later when it's going to be tougher?
M	Seppi is having a lot of firsts this week, like he won his first match in Dubai and he beat Mathieu for the first time. He's never beaten you. Are you expecting a tough match?
M	The other day you were talking about the young generation of Serbia. How about Marko? Do you think he's on his way to...
M	Where is your younger brother now?
M	Obviously a lot has been made about doping. Roger and Andy have come out and said what they have had to say. What are your thoughts on doping control?
M	Have you been bloodtested since Australia?
F	Very tough conditions for you. Your friend, obviously. How do you compare it to the last match in the US Open?
F	Would you say you regret this tension that you had, that maybe you couldn't play your best?
F	When you were talking to your coach at 41, then after you were playing more aggressive.
F	Could you explain how difficult is it to go to the net against her? Because you didn't go to net like you did in the previous match.
F	Still a pretty good week for you, right?
F	Do you feel like because you two didn't play doubles this week so you two can focus more on single now?
F	You don't feel like because you didn't play doubles your singles improve this week?
F	There was an awful lot of break points, breaks of serve throughout the match. Is that due to your style? Are you both better counterpunchers and returners, would you say, or...
F	Was that due to the uncomfortableness when you're facing each other?
F	I presume you wanted to go on and win from here. Although you're disappointed, you wanted to go on and win?
F	On Monday you'll sit next to her again?
F	Would you go and have dinner with her now after the match?
F	She was tough to get on top of, wasn't she?
F	When you play someone that you're not familiar with, do you try and work out how they play, or do you just want to continue playing your own game every match?
F	Did you watch the previous match, the match with Robson, just to sort of get an idea about her?
F	Seems like one of the keys was you were able to convert your break points and she just wasn't when it came down to it. Was that experience, or what do you think it came down to? She's a young girl, 18.
F	You were saying you liked her game. What are her prospects? She just broke into the top 100. Do you sense she's someone that will move up the rankings this year?
F	Who do you think are the best of the players, age about 18, 19, 20 now?
F	Sloane Stephens?
F	Keys? Madison Keys?
F	Would she be the best of that generation, do you think?
F	What does it feel like to be defending a title?
F	There were a lot of service breaks in the first set. Why did you struggle with serve today?
F	Did the rain break help you?
F	Yesterday Wozniacki said the ball was flying. You find it's different.
F	How difficult was that to finish the match off?
F	Few problems with the serve today?
F	We were wondering why you were playing when the shoulder is a problem at the moment with so many big tournaments coming up.
F	After last year, I mean, you rebuilt your ranking. You're right up there near the top ranked. Do you have a particular aim for this year, doing something big in the Grand Slams?
M	How does it feel when you were so close to beating the best clay court player?
M	Were you surprised to be fighting like this against him on clay?
M	Are you encouraged to believe that you can do well in Roland Garros now?
M	Most people when they play Nadal on clay are intimidated. You didn't seem to be at all. How come you can play with so much freedom?
M	This is not the first time you have had cramping issuing during a match. Is it physical or did the tension get to you?
M	I know you went for the huge forehand. What were you thinking at that time?
M	Do you think at some point was it going through your mind, I can do it, I could win today? You were very strong.
M	There are people who compare your style to Federer. What would you have to say to that?
M	Is that a good thing, bad thing, or you don't think it's true?
M	I'm not as much of an expert as you are. How would you describe your style?
M	My assumption is that you're leaving MonteCarlo as a very happy person despite the loss today.
M	Did you feel something was off in Rafa's game today, maybe the backhand or something?
M	You managed to unsettle him. He looked very shaky. Must give you a lot of confidence that you can provoke this kind of reaction from him.
M	That you managed to unsettle him.
M	How is the ankle? Felt okay out there?
M	The fact that it's a different surface, the movement is so different, the lack of court time you had coming in, almost bigger than the sore ankle?
M	In the third set it seemed that you had the match pretty much in control. It slipped away a little bit after you got the warning. What happened at that time?
M	Can you describe how you decided to play yesterday and how to deal with the frustration of not playing at your best?
M	What was it like for your ankle yesterday?
M	Going back to the 25second rule. Are you clear when it starts? If you're drawn up to the umpire's chair for a dropshot, then when does it start?
M	If you have to play Ernests Gulbis, what kind of challenge do you expect? He has won a lot of matches lately.
M	You say you twisted it again.
M	At which point in the match was that?
M	Was it stressful? Was it painful?
M	On the time rule, do you think there should be a shot clock?
M	You didn't play so well in the first set, but apparently it was difficult to find the right rhythm.
M	But you do feel good on clay?
M	After Miami you said you were not fit enough to play in Argentina for the Davis Cup. How do you feel now?
M	Did you talk with the other members of the team about what happened in Argentina?
M	Does this loss in Davis Cup affect the tennis players right now?
F	That was something of a battle today. Difficult to know where to start. How would you describe it?
F	To lose a set 6Love is a very rare occurrence. Can you perhaps explain why you felt that happened and what you did to turn it around?
F	What do you think you need to work on more for the next match?
F	After a match like this, do you use it as a reference of how not to play?
F	The No.1 ranking is on the line this week. Is that something you think about at all?
F	Do you go home this evening angry? Frustrated? Determined? What's the mindset when you come back tomorrow?
F	There has been a lot of talk here in Madrid about drugs cheats with two hundred bags of blood about to be destroyed. Do you like to see drugs cheats?
F	The cyclists, where there are 200 bags of blood.
F	Do you like to see people who cheat by taking drugs exposed?
F	It's the 40th anniversary of this year for a lot of things.
F	Almost. Not far off. The formation of the WTA, Billie Jean King's Battle of the Sexes, equal prize money at the US Open and all that sort of thing. When you reflect on the journey women's tennis has made, what do you think?
M	Congratulations for the match. Do you feel pressure to make it to the finals in all the tournaments and not be out of the top 10 in the end of year?
M	In that moment, you had lost your second set and you hadn't started well the third set. You were playing a little bit to your limits, right?
M	I wanted to ask you about the crowd. Perhaps here in the Caja Mgica. It's very big. 12,000 people. You've played some matches with half of the people. Court 2 was really full. Do you prefer Court 2 really full or Caja Mgica half full?
M	Tomorrow is another battle against Nadal. Do you have any new tactics?
M	Congratulations for the victory. I'm talking about the same thing, tomorrow's match against Rafa. It's a quarterfinals tomorrow. Does it benefit you to you play in quarterfinals instead of a final? Do you feel less pressure playing in a quarterfinal instead of a final?
M	What happened in Acapulco, does it affect the way you face tomorrow's match against Rafa?
M	Nadal has had a quite easy victory today. You've had to play three sets. Have you used a lot of your physical energy today?
M	You had a similar match with Haas in Indian Wells and he had the break. Here you kept playing tough. Did the other match help you somehow, give you confidence that if you did it there you could do it here again?
M	There is a problem if the courts are slippery. What do you think? Can you compare the small court against the central court?
F	How was that match? It was pretty crazy. You had your ankle and then you came back and almost lost the lead in the third set. Sum it up, please.
F	How is your ankle? Do you know?
F	So there has been a lot talk recently about your coaching situation. You're with your father here. Talk about your relationship with him and how he helps your tennis.
F	Can you explain what happened after that first set. Second set was 60.
F	You were up 52 in the third set. She started coming back there.
F	First time they've had a semifinal here with two Czech players. How well do you know Petra?
F	Do you think this will be watched very closely back home?
F	Back home in Czech Republic, do you think this match will be watched closely?
F	Third semifinal since you got married. Is that the secret?
F	When did you change your coach?
F	What is the main difference with this coach?
F	It's been a few years, but you have had some success against Petra. What are you going to have to do to be able to beat her?
F	Was there a difference emotionally playing in front of such a sparse crowd as opposed to playing on the stadium court?
F	You're supposed to play on stadium, then with the weather, how difficult is it to play with a couple rain delays?
M	Well done. You are playing like you're on fire at the moment. Is it just a question of not getting too hot too quickly?
M	What are the things which enable you to hold it longer? Is it practice or physical fitness?
M	It also looked as if you were getting to the ball very early so you were hitting the ball early. Is that right?
M	Is it too soon to get too excited, or do you feel like your best game is coming back?
M	As you said, tomorrow's match is not going to be as easy as today's. Do you see yourself as the title contender?
M	I know you talked a little bit about this, about, you know, last season. I have seen you in Dubai and Doha the past few years, and you seem a lot different in terms of the way you're moving on the court. You talked about injuries. Are you 100% fit now?
M	But in terms of injuries that you talked about, was there a like last two years, I guess you have had certain types of injuries. Was it knees, arms? What was the injuries that affected your play?
M	In terms of coming back, I mean, is this the same game that we would have seen in Doha in 2010 or even when you were I mean, or is there something you did in the offseason to change your game? What would you say the big difference from last year to now is?
M	In terms of the game, is it the same game that you were playing last year, or are there different things you're doing?
F	You must be pleased with that performance. How did it go for you?
F	You got really animated after you managed to hold serve and saved all those break points with aces and stuff. Do you feel the match would have gotten more her way if she had broken at that point?
F	You still have, with this whole race for the top ranking, you have an outside chance if everything goes your way andyou're still on pace. Is that something, to get back to No.1, would that be you know, a lot of you guys don't seem to be thinking too much about it, but would it be important for you?
F	You have been somebody who always likes to kind of have your private life, aside from this. Do you think that your fans have any true sense of who the real Maria is?
F	Your next opponent is either Serena or Petra. Can you walk us through the matchups with both of them?
F	If Serena wins today she would become the oldest No.1 of the history of the rankings. Can you talk a little bit about what would that mean, 31andsomething years of age?
F	Just wondering, when you were at the Olympics, did you have any opportunity to meet or watch Oscar Pistorius? Were you surprised by the news yesterday? I'm sure you were, like everyone.
F	That was a great game. How do you feel winning the first round that easily?
F	Were there any difficulties while playing?
F	I wasn't here for the previous presser, but I wonder if you know about the Diamond Trophy. Is that any extra motivation at all?
F	I remember you beat Garcia in 2011 during the French Open. Do you feel that her game has changed? Has she improved?
F	I know you have been asked this question a lot about how do you feel about coming back to Doha, but I have seen your match and the crowd's reaction. It's no doubt you're the crowd favorite. How do you feel today coming back after quite some time?
F	Did you see the results of the last Grammy Awards?
F	No performances?
F	If you have to decide what was your song of the year, what would it be?
F	Which song? You can sing. Can you try?
F	It will be my last question about music, but I was discussing with Laura Robson about One Direction, the British band. Do you like this band? And which member is your favorite?
F	You haven't been here for a few years, but you have actually never ever lost a match here. Are you aware of that when you step on the court? Does it play with your mentality at all, knowing you haven't lost here?
F	Last year you lost early in Montreal with a Love/Love to Karatantcheva. Different experience this year?
F	Can you just talk about the course of the match? You know, she didn't serve her best. Just how you coped mentally and kind of the upanddown moments.
F	What did Darren say to you when he came out in the second set? I think you were up 41, and you had some very loose games. You called him out and you seemed to settle down after that.
F	I know you have won titles before, but this has to be in some ways your best tournament. You beat two former No.1s and now a Wimbledon champion.
F	Petra said that you could always hit the ball hard, but one thing you did today which you didn't do maybe in the past is you showed her you could stay in the rallies, too.
F	How do you actually work on being more consistent? What kind of things do you do?
F	Was there something that changed your mindset?
F	You said yesterday that you're also working on staying calm throughout the match. Are there any specific kind of tactics you use to make sure you stay calm?
F	You must be a little bit happy that she doublefaulted on six break points?
F	You want to talk a little bit about Li Na, another former Grand Slam champion who you will be playing?
F	You're managing to surprise your opponent and turn the game around, surprise the public, surprise them. How do you do that?
F	You took some time off after Wimbledon, and obviously this is your first match back. Were you surprised how well you played today?
F	You missed some time of course with the injury. How is the hamstring?
F	What are you planning to do different in your next match? How are you thinking to approach the next match?
F	Tomorrow and on Friday they are doing some exhibition matches here with some of the firstround losers from the men's tournament.
F	I'm wondering, beyond Pete Sampras, what do you think of that idea bringing men here to the women's tour? Is that a good thing, or does that detract from the women's game?
F	Do you think women should also play then?
M	Your reaction to the shocking news of the death of Maria De Villota to today.
M	The first set, the tiebreak in particular, a very long one. Can you talk about how you were able to steal that set.
M	Do you know in China people usually like to cheer for the unstrong one. In the tiebreak when you hear they cheer for Wawrinka, how do you adjust yourself mentally?
M	I know for the players, they have a whole set of weapons. What is your biggest weapon for tonight for you to win the match? Is it the same weapon you use in the past that you win a lot of matches?
M	You mentioned you're quite pleased to make the semifinals here because of the speed of the court. Does it continue to surprise you that you've been able to maintain the success on not just hard courts but especially fast hard courts?
M	You spent a lot of time with the Chinese player Wu Di. Talk about him, some opinions about his potential.
M	Any advice?
M	Your thoughts on playing Del Potro? You played him in Indian Wells.
M	Good start. What happened after that?
M	Your own serve probably wasn't what you would have wanted today.
M	What would your plans be for the rest of the year in terms of tournaments?
M	'A niggle.' Do you have any sort of clues about what might be going on there?
M	Will you do that here before you go?
M	On a completely unrelated event, the Australian Open, record crowds all the time. Do you ever look back and think what might have happened if the move to Melbourne Park had not been made? It's become something that a lot of people never thought it would be.
M	Probably grown more than the others, would it be fair to say?
M	What are your personal expectations over the next 12 months?
M	Through to the semis without dropping a set. That's a pretty good run so far.
M	You seemed to mix it up even more today than you do against some other guys. Was that because it was Marin or just the way you were feeling today?
M	He started to play particularly well around about the fourth game in the second set. Did you find your level rising as a result of that? Is that something that often happens?
M	Ivan said yesterday in the interview that if you get to No.2 there is a possibility for the clay season that Rafa, Novak, and Roger could be in the same half. Is that something you have thought of at all?
M	Speaking of the big three that are not here right now, when they're not in a tournament obviously you get some tough opponents like today, you have Berdych and Ferrer. When they're not here, do you miss them? Do you miss the challenge, or do you say, Hey, I get more confidence and it's better for me?
M	Marin seems to be playing well again, but he's not quite up to the top 10, hasn't gotten back there yet. Are you surprised he's not up there at least with the Berdyches or Tsongas of this world?
M	What's the most challenging part of his game for you? What's the most impressive thing about him to you?
M	How big a surprise for you was it to see Novak lose to Del Potro and in consecutive weeks on hard courts? That was unexpected, don't you think?
M	Did you get to see the Heat game?
M	Thoughts on it? Disappointed?
M	Wondered what you thought about the Davis Cup lineup: Ward, Baker, and Tursunov, Donskoy. And do you give the British team a chance on that one?
F	You started well and then she kind of got back into it. Can you talk about the match?
F	Are you able to take a positive from a match like this where you really were hanging tough against her and then maybe the match slipped away from you a little bit? Are you able to take the positives from that?
F	You had the ace to go up 4015 with a chance to even that second set at 3All. Did you feel that was a big momentum shifter when she was able to come back and break you?
F	Has it been harder for you in professional tennis since beating Serena at the Australian Open? You're 19. You have just done the greatest thing you can possibly do. Has the next step been harder than you thought it was going to be?
F	What's happening differently since Australia in these matches? You've lost five of seven. What's going on differently than what was happening at the Australian that was working so well?
F	But you want to win, obviously.
M	Tough start.
M	How did you get back into it and turn it around?
M	Going back to 2011, I guess you are 50 in thirdset tiebreakers. What was it about getting into that third set?
M	You seem to go the distance a lot. You play three sets when you can go three sets; you play five sets when you can go five sets. It's a bad habit.
M	How bad did you need this win mentally?
M	Can you talk about that call when he was serving for the match at 65? How did you see that?
M	I know you are probably asked this a lot since Andy Roddick retired, but do you feel any extra pressure with American tennis to kind of take that mantle?
M	Any thoughts on playing Cilic next? Do you have a court preference for it?
M	Are you hearing the Ultra Festival at night?
F	You talked about your tank being empty yesterday. You had enough to get over the finish line today by the end. How did you summon the last burst of energy?
F	And Patrick said that he felt the first game of the second set was probably the most crucial of the match. I just wondered if you felt the same thing?
F	Do you think you are mentally stronger than anybody else on the tour?
F	Do you think after today's game we can say the tennis quality between you and the other players are closing up?
F	82 matches this year. You won I think 15 tournaments total. Playing that much, is that something you can keep up in the future, playing this many tournaments so consistently without long breaks? How do you look back on this year and the whole scheduling?
F	Are you still not prepared to call this the best season of your career?
F	What did you do to refuel last night?
F	As we know, Li Na had a good year this year. What do you think of her? What do you speak of her for today's game?
F	How do you like the idea of having an orchid named after you? Because that's what they are thinking of doing next year for the Championships in Singapore.
F	Having an orchid flower named after you.
F	And your thoughts of the Championships moving out of Istanbul to Singapore?
F	When you look back at the season, what are some of the things that stand out for you?
F	Do you, when you look back at your season, getting back in the car, lying in bed, do you tend to focus on the great wins or do those four losses kind of get at you?
F	Undefeated season next year is possible, then?
F	You mentioned the Grand Slams that when Doug asked you about was it your best season. Is it kind of important that you had those moments where you want to do better next season to sort of keep you going?
F	And the Australian Open obviously was one of those this year where you feel like maybe it could have gone better. I know you're thinking about your final for the moment, but it's not too far away, is it?
F	You're always regarded as one of the best players ever, so what do you think you can add to your game to make it even more perfect, I should say?
F	How much are you looking forward to vacation? You've got two months ahead of you.
F	You will take at least a couple of weeks, I would think, before you get back into training, no?
F	Do you ever consider going to the snow rather than doing a beach thing?
F	You did that once during the offseason?
F	You did what? Tahoe or Colorado or what?
F	You skied?
F	Did you ski?
F	Right now obviously it's the end of the season and tired and fatigued and things, but looking back, was it fun? Was the season fun? Was it a fun year of tennis for you?
F	And you shattered the prize money record for women, breaking the $10 million mark up there along with like Roger and Rafa and Novak. Must be pretty good.
F	Can you just tell us what happened with the injury? You're clearly in a lot of discomfort.
F	It was clear you were in a lot of pain out there. Looked like you were crying and you let out some yells. Why play on, maybe risk another injury, when it was pretty clear it would be tough to win the match, anyways?
F	So you really thought you'd be criticized if you retired, even though it was very clear you were in pain?
F	But at the beginning you said there would be a discussion about something when you listed the three reasons.
F	Did the trainer assure you that you would not further injure yourself, or were they not clear enough with what the injury was to give you that assurance?
F	During the last set and a half, there were several times it looked like you might stop. Were there times you thought, okay, I'm going to stop here, or whatever happens I'm going to go to the end?
F	Just to clarify, it looked like at the end of the point before the serve that you might have felt something. Maybe I'm wrong on that. Was it just after that serve and you landed that you locked up that you felt the pain for the first time?
F	It's been a very successful season in that you won the Australian Open at the start of the year. How do you reflect on the year now that it's come to an end? It must have been frustrating also the number of little injuries that you picked up along the way.
F	I was reading Andre Agassi's book recently. He was talking about how a loss he had in a Grand Slam final to Sampras wound up affecting him for months and months mentally. Sort of hasn't been the best few months for you since the US Open final resultswise. Do you think that match is still in your head at all?
F	You and Li Na briefly talked after the match, and could you tell us what was the conversation about?
F	Talking about the injury, Li Na said earlier when she was here in the news conference the next time you're going to play each other, she wishes both of you are healthy.
F	Yeah. Do you feel sorry that the last two meetings between you two went to a similar situation, like she had injury during the final of the Australian Open and you had injury this time? It's kind of a very unlucky situation.
F	You're looking for the next meeting between you two?
F	If you could just talk about a couple of things that were going through your head after your injury and you're on court and you were emotional, but what were you thinking about?
F	Pretty clean match from you. You seemed to control it very well. You were opportunistic. The whole time she was a little bit off, but it seemed like it was in your hands most of the time.
F	When you lose four times in a row...
F	In a row, coming into this match.
F	Few times after that.
F	Obviously they weren't weighing on your mind?
F	You actually seemed as though you were having a wonderful time out there, not just playing a tennis match, but actually really relishing the experience. Do you think that's a testament to the new attitude?
F	Coming into this match, you didn't have a lot of success against top 4 players recently.
F	Fair enough.
F	Do you feel like you have something to do? Did you feel like coming into this match you had something to prove?
F	Do you think that getting a result like this, does that suggest your standard is as high as it used to be when you were at the top, or...
F	How about your confidence levels? I don't mean here in the press conference, but when you walk out onto court, do you feel as confident as you did three or four years ago when you were at the very top of the rankings?
F	I felt like you were enjoying yourself in the court, but you also seemed very ambitious.
F	In what way? You seemed like you want to win this tournament. On a scale of 1 to 10, how ambitious are you about winning this tournament?
F	You mentioned taking advantage of some of the things that Victoria wasn't doing as well. What were some of the weaknesses you spotted today that you were able to take advantage of?
F	Two things: One, did you think that you might never get back to the yearend Championships, No.1, and secondly, you talked about some of the things you improved in your game, but do you think you're a better player than when you were at No.1 or are you just trying to get back to that level?
F	I mean more generally, though.
F	The second question?
F	Do you think you're a better player?
F	Than 2008 or...
F	More shots, but mentally... Sorry. You asked.
M	I can't remember seeing a player play as well as you did in the third set and yet not win the set. How hard was that to take?
M	How disappointing is that loss?
M	The three break points you had at 4All, was it just hard kind of mentally and emotionally to get past that?
M	Obviously you're disappointed in losing. Just wonder if you could appreciate the high level of tennis that was played out there. Obviously the fans loved it. Just some great shots. Can you grasp that, or is the loss too much right now?
M	Is it right to think you may be missing just a little bit of confidence?
M	You just came off the court, as you said. You won six slams yourself. When you think about 13 for Rafa, can you kind of give me an assessment of what you feel like that stands for in the history of the game and maybe appreciation as an opponent?
M	We could all see how physically demanding this match was for both of you. But could you describe the mental challenge of staying focused and staying positive against a player like Nadal and in a match with so many swings of momentum?
M	Did you feel focused from the first ball today?
M	Rafa was asked after the semifinal if he looked forward to the prospect of facing you in the final, and he said no. He elaborated, frankly, I wish I would play a player who would be easier. He said, let's be honest. Do you feel the same way when you are presented with that opportunity to play him on that stage, or do you feel this is an opportunity to play one of the best players of all time at the height of his game and see where it takes you in your game?
M	Could you tell me about just the experience, incredibly long rallies in the second set, and if you have memories of it in relation to other points in your career?
M	If you look back at your Grand Slam season, what is the dominating feeling?
M	Three years ago you sit here and you lost last time against Nadal Grand Slam on a hard court. I will cite your words. This was so frustrating a little bit. He's getting better each time you play him. He's mentally so strong and dedicated to the sport. After you achieved one of the amazing year in the tennis history, you move to No.1. How do you think this time you can turn around again this frustration to extra motivation for next year?
M	Could you say anything at all about the No.1 ranking, which is going to be pretty difficult, number of points you're defending and the number of points isn't.
M	Very tough day. What went on today?
M	You haven't looked particularly comfortable all tournament. Have you felt like you sort of haven't been able to find your rhythm or your best tennis?
M	Was it his game? Your game?
M	Does it make it harder when the guy keeps points so short? Was it one of those where you can't get any kind of rhythm?
M	Has it been a little tougher perhaps than even you imagined to come off down from the kind of mountaintop of Wimbledon and get everything right, all the focus right after that big high?
M	Was there anything about the whole experience  it was a new experience, defending a big title like this  that perhaps it took you by surprise or anything about the whole thing that...
M	Did he throw anything tactically at you that you weren't expecting?
M	Do you think the last 12 months have been more physically taxing or mentally taxing on you?
M	How difficult has the scheduling of your matches made it for you?
M	You have been incredibly consistent, as you said, at reaching the latter stages of Grand Slams. Does that make this more disappointing? How much does it motivate you?
M	First Grand Slam semifinal for Stan. When you see the way he played today, can you see him as a contender for these titles now?
M	Do you think Davis Cup might be a good challenge for you now in two weeks' time, a good change from the Grand Slam scene?
M	Just to clarify, aren't any kind of underlying physical issues you have been keeping quiet?
F	It was again a big battle today. How do you think you did?
F	Do you feel like you're at any kind of a disadvantage being a day behind? Do you think anything could have been done to change that yesterday?
F	Do you feel like your game right now is at the same level where it was when you beat Serena in Cincinnati?
F	You became a dropshot maniac.
F	I had the feeling that the way Ana start the match being so aggressive and so many winners, 17 just by the end of the first set, left you a little bit annoyed and nervous for the rest of the match. Am I right?
F	No?
F	There was a point in the first set where you maybe accidently hit yourself with the racquet in the leg. After one point in the first set you were looking at your leg like you might have hit yourself with the racquet a little bit. Is that just kind of the way it was going?
F	Did you feel serve at some point is hurting your game the past couple of weeks?
F	Can you talk about the matchup with Daniela?
F	Of the eight women in the quarters, five of them are over the age of 30. Is there something about the way the game is now that allows women to play kind of deeper into their careers?
F	I understand that Red Foo is in Australia; is that right?
F	Why is he there?
F	So you're beside yourself without him by your side?
F	I am just joking around.
F	The joke was that you were beside yourself without him by your side, and it will affect your down the line backhand, I'm sure.
F	Today, from the end of the first set to the start of the second, you guys broke each other seven straight times. Then it seemed like you took control when you held your serve a couple of times there in...
F	Including the end of the first?
F	You spoke a moment ago of Daniela as a shotmaker. What are the other attributes you think of when you think of her game and also the fact that she's been on the tour as long as she has?
F	Are you concerned about the slow starts, two matches in a row?
F	Yeah, are you concerned?
F	You said the other day that you really relish pressure, that you like pressure. Is that one of the qualities that can help you bounce back from being down a set and able to come back and play hard?
F	How much did that come in to play, especially in the third set when she looked like she was turning the tide around coming back on you?
F	When you come off court, are you more pleased when you won the match that takes a lot of fight or just the overall?
F	I guess, I mean, you've won two slams now. You are going into possibly the last three matches. How much more do you think you can improve? Like what percentage do you think you're playing now?
F	In your gut, do you think you can win this year?
F	You know what it takes to win a Grand Slam. Are you happy right now where your game is at going into the quarterfinals?
F	Big win today for Nike over Under Armour. Will Phil Knight be giving you a call congratulating you?
F	Talk about your feelings going into the match. Take us through the first and second set, winning that first set. The 54 game turned out to be huge.
F	Was it a highquality match from both players? Did you feel that way out there?
F	There were reports that when Venus went vegan to manage her Sjogren's, you initially supported the diet to be supportive. Have you kept that diet up?
F	You're very supportive of the other young American players, particularly Sloane, yet you have to go out and play them and beat them. Is that a tough thing for you to do?
F	Can you remember the last time you had backtoback double faults to get broken?
F	You really made her move around a lot. Talk about your movement, your defense.
F	Did you feel like you had to hang in there a little bit longer to get some errors from her, as well?
F	There are reports you're looking to relaunching your Aneras line. Can you talk about where you are in that stage?
F	Growing up with your parents as your coaches, what advice do you have to parents of young players that are trying to get them to the place you're at in your career?
F	Great record since you started working with Patrick. What are the one or two things he's brought to you?
F	With all the hype that came around this match, do you think there will be any problem for a possible letdown in the next round?
F	When you talk about your focus, did it feel more than a fourthround match to you?
F	The one thing Sloane has to work on to get to the next level, what do you think it is?
F	Do you go out there with the idea in your mind that you're not going to upstage me on a big stage again? You're a fierce competitor.
F	You had a brief exchange at the end of the match at the net with Sloane. What was that about?
F	That was a very big celebration for you for a fourthround match in a slam. Why?
F	To the box, when you pirouetted.
F	Roger and Rafa have never played here before.
F	Against each other (laughter).
F	If you had to say which one is greater, Roger with his 17 slams or Rafa who has a 2110 advantage over Roger, can you pick?
F	If you can't beat the guy in your era... It's a hard choice to make. If you were dominated by somebody, it would be hard to say you were the best player of your era.
F	Outside the Williams family, who do you think is the best of all time in the women's game?
F	Who among the others are the best, would you say?
F	The best of all time.
F	If your when you have kids, will they be tennis players?
F	Why?
F	46% of your serves were unreturned. In Cincinnati you were struggling a little bit. What do you make of that stat?
F	You said that Sloane is already at the next level. Can you define 'next level' for you? Is that top 5?
F	You battled back in that match. Talk about the match.
F	As you go deeper in the tournament, the competition gets tougher. Do you think it's better to have a tough match relatively early on?
F	Talk about a matchup with Victoria Azarenka.
F	You said your number one goal is to get back to the top of the game where you were before. You're going to have to beat players like Victoria. The opportunity to play her, is that an exciting challenge for you?
F	Can you tell the difference when you're playing an American player out there? I wasn't in the stadium, so I couldn't hear what was happening. Was there a lot of support for her? Does it matter to you?
F	You've been on the circuit for quite a while. You probably know better than anyone how it's a grind. You posted the famous quote, Only he who knows the best nation knows the way. Could you take a moment and talk about that quote, what it means to you.
F	What are your goals then? Have you been pleased with this process?
F	Can you share your goal?
F	You had a fulltime coach for a few years. You said a few weeks ago it's a collaboration with a new team. I would think you're coaching yourself a bit now. When you're out on court, are you making most of the decisions?
F	What's the difference between winning the big points against McHale today and when you played Victoria a few weeks ago? Do you feel differently inside?
F	What did you think when you first heard that Maria and Jimmy had parted company after one match?
F	Do you remember the first time or two you were in this big interview room and what was that like?
F	What was the last match you won that you would describe as a big win?
F	What's the difference when you actually win the match?
F	Can you talk about challenges for female players in particular in finding the right balance of fitness, weight training, weight in general? For men it seems a little more cut and dry than maybe it is for women.
F	Many people in tennis think Novak is a great guy. It's taken a while for him to catch on with the public. Can you share about your relationship with Novak, a fun story from your early years.
F	He speaks candidly in his book about when the bombs were falling and the fear. Do you remember that? Do you remember practicing even at courts that were in harm's way?
F	There's a lot of excitement about the Sloane/Serena rematch outside of the locker room. Is it also something that would excite players?
F	Is it interesting enough that yourself and some other players would actually turn on the TV and watch?
F	Who is your favorite commentator on television?
F	You were trailing in the second set. What do you do mentally to come back?
F	Going back a little bit to the question of diet. In Washington we were asking a lot of players about supplements. Dmitry Tursunov said something, that you exert so much energy on court, in practice, that you literally can't eat enough and drink enough to replenish, so you have to take supplements. I'm curious about whether what happened with Viktor and Marin with the blood testing, has that changed anything with you about what you take?
M	First of all, just talk about the match. Are you pleased with the way things went out there?
M	You're playing your 16th...
M	I think more than anybody in the draw.
M	Talk about what you can gain. People look at age a lot and put a lot of emphasis on age and deteriorating skills and so forth. But with age comes experience. Do you find that that is working in your favor here, especially going into week 2?
M	I know you have battled injury throughout your career. At 35 years old, seems like you have hit, I don't know, maybe a little bit of a fountain of youth. You're playing some solid tennis right now. Just talk about the state of your...
M	You have seen quarterfinal action here but it's been a few years. How hungry are you to get back to having those moments where you can get into the quarters or better?
F	Can you talk about how you're playing right now relative to how you've played the rest of the season leading up to the US Open?
F	Are you pleased with the match? Are you pleased with the way you played today?
F	You're one of only 32 only woman that have been No.1 in the world, and you said the other day that it is your goal to get back there. Knowing what it takes, how close do you think you are to realizing that goal?
F	What are some of the things you are working on right now?
F	What don't you miss about being No.1?
F	Sara Errani, who lost today, said she was having a really, really hard time dealing with coming in as the fourth seed and that there was a lot of pressure on her. She seemed very emotional and upset she's not able to handle that pressure. Can that be a problem when you're up on the top, the expectations are so much higher?
F	Can you talk about the whole Victoria Duval story?
F	Are there a couple of keys to dealing with that sort of pressure, based on your experience?
F	Going through the second set in your mind, what stood out as the momentumturning points?
F	Are you happy with the way you played today?
F	How do you feel about your game coming in with the events here in the States coming up, semifinal in New Haven? Do you think you felt like you got progressively better from Montreal [sic] to Cincinnati to New Haven?
F	Are you back to where you think you can make a final like you did in?
F	In your career, a lot of great runs, and some setbacks, as well. Over the years, what do you think is the best advice you've gotten? If you could, just reflect on that for a minute.
F	You have had contacts with a number of other sports. Which sport, boxing or golf, has given you more, and have you learned more from it?
F	The American boxer Tex Cobb said boxing isn't like tennis. You get one hit and it's your ass. You're out of there.
F	Sounds like Wozniacki on court.
F	Do you actually talk much with Rory about tennis or golf? I mean, is it something that almost you would avoid unless there is a real issue?
F	He says he doesn't get real stressed out about watching you. Do you not get stressed out about watching him?
F	Crissy, Chris Evert, on TV had some nice words to say about you. She also said if she were you could you use another pair of eyes, and if she were you she'd run out and grab Thomas Hogstedt. He's had great success. Would you consider him as a possibly helping you in the future?
F	A question about your opponent. Not so many Chinese girls so big and hitting so hard. What's your assessment of her future on the tour?
F	I think I saw your dog earlier today. What kind of dog is it? How old is it? What's its name? How often does it travel?
F	Djokovic said his dog Pierre has gotten healthy since he went nongluten. Would consider the same for Bruno?
M	Hard slog. How proud are you of the fight, just pushing through the way you did?
M	Is it more sort of fighting away than necessarily playing great tennis today?
M	I think you have played six fivesetters at the slams and won five of them. Can you tell us what you enjoy about that?
M	Is it important to do well away from Australia and Wimbledon, too? You have had two good slams and two not so good. Is that extra sort of incentive?
M	What do you like about NewYork?
M	Nishikori said he knew absolutely nothing about Dan. You saw the result, but what do you know about Dan? He's has a colorful career, seems like.
M	Have you noticed him practicing?
M	(Question regarding scouting Evans' practice.)
M	You talk about it being very important to keep your focus here and NewYork being a hard place for that. How has the personal situation with the uncertainty every tournament regarding your dad played into that?
M	Who is in your box now?
M	Who is your hitting partner at the moment?
M	So do you hope this will be a bit of a turning point? Not much success since Wimbledon. Rough patch for you. Winning like this, do you think it can turn things around for the rest of the year?
M	You lost your focus.
M	Evans is coming off a good run. He beat Nieminen. Have you registered at all what he's been doing? There are an awful lot of guys playing like that.
M	Given all the controversy about Andy Roddick's match last year, do you feel like you proved a point today in this gutsy performance?
M	Tomas, it looked like you had a hard time reading Rafa's spin today. Is that fairly accurate?
M	You played him on hard courts a lot, obviously, over the years. Is there something different he's doing on hard this year, being more aggressive maybe than in the past? His record on hard has never been better than this year.
M	You had just gotten a break midway through the second set and broke it right back. Can you take us through that game when you served to try to take it to 53.
M	What do you think you need to do to be able to pull out these kinds of matches against Rafa? What different thing can you do?
M	Tomas, first time top 5 next week. How does that feel?
M	I know you didn't want to talk about it yesterday, but how does it feel specifically to pass Roger in rankings for the first time in your career?
M	What's your next sort of goal? You accomplished top 5. What's next for you?
M	I realize it's hard to talk about the positives coming out of a loss, but what are any positives that you can take from this week or this match into your US Open?
M	You dropped only 15 games in six sets coming into today's match. Obviously, a big win against Murray, and right there in two very close sets against Rafa. Given that, what are you looking to do to prepare for the Open with respect to coming off a very successful week?
M	Are you going to play next week?
M	You usually play that tournament, so with respect to maybe not playing it, what would you do with that week between now and New York if you don't play?
M	John, in a match between two of the tour's top two servers, how much do you think your serve really set the tone for today's match?
M	Do you prepare any differently when you play a big hitter? It's like preparing to play yourself.
M	Two big servers on a nonHawkeye court, that had to have been frustrating at times just to deal with the blind calls and things like that.
M	How much of a priority do you think the tour should make getting Hawkeye on more, if not all, courts?
M	Premier.
M	You just generally feel more comfortable on a court that has it?
M	Sort of a different question, Marion Bartoli announced that she's retiring last night suddenly, like about a month after winning Wimbledon. Just wondering what your thoughts on somebody doing something like that is.
M	Obviously this is a lot of years away for you, but have you thought about how you want to exit the sport someday?
M	John, there's been a lot of talk about first time there's no American men in the top 20. What does that mean to you? Do you take it personal? Do you feel like you have to carry the torch, or do you just take care of yourself?
M	You're right back in next week, by the way.
M	You're already back in for next week, top 20.
M	So maybe you do care now.
M	Sorry to take you back to D.C., the final against Juan Martin, but how often have you had to dodge a ball from the baseline like you sort of did in that match?
M	Yeah.
M	Is there a bigger weapon, perhaps other than your serve, than his forehand when it's going?
M	Not an easy firstround match, but none of them are easy here. What's your assessment of the performance?
M	Is that going for too much on the second serve?
M	How do you adjust? You come to a tournament like this, and obviously preparation for the Open and everything, and obviously you plan to play a few matches. When you don't have any more matches, what do you do now? Is there a Plan B? Do you just kind of cool your pants a bit after this or what?
M	So you'll practice here, or do you go straight to Winston?
M	Easy to find guys to hit with?
M	I have a question about serve and volley tennis. You're a big server. There's quite a few big servers out there, but serve and volley has kind of disappeared. Theories on that?
M	Did you ever play a lot of serve and volley guys coming through, or are they just not out there?
M	Anyone try to turn you into a serve and volleyer?
M	Would you let them?
M	Sam, it's been sort of a tough stretch of the season for you. I know you missed Canada or pulled out of Canada. Everything going okay basically?
M	Today the rankings change, and the first time ever there's no Americans in top 20. I was just wondering what your reflections are on that happening.
M	22.
M	Is there some reason why it happened, do you think? I mean, it's never happened before.
F	Your feelings right now.
F	I think you were nine when Steffi played her last Wimbledon final. Do you remember that day, and what does it feel like for you to be in the final?
F	Did she call you or send you an email?
F	How does it feel to be the first German to reach the final since Steffi?
F	A lot of people are comparing this match to your match with Serena with the scorelines being similar. Is there a way to compare the two?
F	It was such a thriller in the third set that even the electronic scoreboard had a heart attack. Are things like these just out of your scope? How did you regain your focus in the third set and pull through?
F	What happened in the second set?
F	And that's it?
F	Did that help you going off for a break?
F	Now that you're into the final, if you become the Wimbledon champion, what will that mean for your career and life?
F	On Saturday you will face a different type of opponent. What sort of match do you expect with Marion?
F	How do your styles compare?
F	The handshake at the end wasn't particularly warm. It was a great match, and it went very, very quickly, the handshake. Were you at all concerned by that?
F	When you first made the quarters here in '09, I think a lot of people were getting excited about your game, the big serve and stuff. Do you feel like making the final now, four years later, is faster than expected? Did you think it would come sooner?
F	Can you talk about the dream of winning Wimbledon? Did it happen after four hours of practice? After a junior win? When you were watching Wimbledon as a child? Can you recall?
F	Do you remember a court or a player?
F	How many autographs do you think you have given after the match?
F	How do you like the atmosphere, the fans at Wimbledon? What does it mean to you?
F	Do you believe in destiny? Do you think there's some sort of destined run here? The draw has broken open, but you've actually had a tough draw regardless.
F	You've talked about the inspiration you drew from the time you were recovering after Indian Wells and how that's given ou confidence and belief. At the time, did you ever believe that you could be at a level like this?
F	What was your most fervent dream?
F	What you have achieved so far, I think a lot of people believe it's very inspiring. Can you share with us, when you feel very down, in a difficult time, what makes you keep going, make you stronger?
F	You're so popular in this country. Are you more popular in England than you are in Germany, do you think?
F	Can you tell us who has inspired you?
F	Have you met either of them?
F	You seemed to be having problems with your breathing. Seemed to be perspiring a lot. Do you have a touch of flu or something?
F	Did it affect your stamina?
F	When did that start? Did you feel badly when you woke up today or previously?
F	4All in the last set, do you think maybe it was an issue of not winning as many matches as you had here before when you won this tournament, the confidence?
F	Did playing under the roof make it any worse?
F	Do you feel it was bad luck because you got sick before so you are going to forget this easily, or is it a tough loss for you because there was a big opportunity?
F	You've been in a bunch of slam quarterfinals. Did this one feel different because of the other players who weren't here?
F	What were you doing particularly well in this tournament that you can kind of use as momentum as we get over to the States, which I know you don't love playing in, but it's a reality?
F	Are you planning to go back to Czech and have a rest and training block or...
F	Illness aside today, where would you say your level is now today compared to when you won here two years ago?
F	Going into the quarterfinal today, did it feel different at all than the quarterfinal in 2011?
F	Pironkova.
F	But looking back then, did you feel like you were going into that match with less to lose than maybe today?
F	Is Kirsten playing well enough to perhaps go on and win the whole thing?
F	All the media are being asked who do we think are going to win. We don't have any idea.
F	Can you make any sense of what's happened to this tournament? Can you explain all these strange results that have happened?
M	The Friday night crowd was more raucous than tonight's crowd. Did you want to get them on your side more today than usual?
M	Mikhail said he thought you lost focus in the second set. Would that be your answer, as well?
M	You had to dig a little deeper this time. Do you regard these slightly tougher matches as good practice for upcoming fixtures?
M	Quite a while since your match finished. Have you required extra treatment for anything?
M	Nothing to worry about?
M	How much pressure do you feel right now coming towards the end?
M	A number.
M	You said in your postmatch TV that you actually felt calmer in this match than the previous rounds. Any reason why that was?
M	Athletes often say they learn more from losses than wins. Just wondering, do you subscribe to that theory? If so, what in your experience has brought you to that conclusion?
M	What is your perception of the current British men's tennis?
M	Novak said after his last match that he thought it was good for the game that we've seen different people coming through, there will be different names in the quarterfinals. Do you agree with that?
M	You're the last Brit left in. I know this is a familiar thing for you at a tournament. It means that the whole nation, there's nobody else to deflect the pressure from you as we enter the second week. Is that something you actually enjoy all the extra pressure being heaped on you rather than rebelling against it?
M	Outside of your circle, do you think there's an assumption out there that you will make the final and possibly a lack of understanding of the hard work that you have to do to do first?
M	Speaking to one former player who said to me at the start the tournament that if you told Andy Murray he'd be facing Verdasco in the quarterfinals, he'd be happy. Would he be right?
M	Barry Cowan.
M	Can you talk about the particular challenge that Verdasco poses and where you're going to turn, I presume, for practice against lefties?
M	Who do you think will be the No.1 at the end of the year?
M	I think this is Verdasco's first Grand Slam quarterfinal for about three years. Are you surprised that he's maybe had the dip that he had?
M	Can I clear something up, please. I noticed you holding your side during the match. You seemed to wince a couple of times. Is that anything to do with the back injury you have had, or is there any cause for concern?
M	How much pain would it take to put you out of this tournament?
M	Is this the most domineering you've felt at Wimbledon?
M	One of the first things you mentioned when you came off court was that you saw Serena lose, that sort of got you more thinking that everyone has to be prepared. How much in general do you think what happens on the women's side, players on the men's side, and vice versa, does it affect the atmosphere of a joint tournament like this?
F	You're five times champion here. Were you annoyed having to wait all day to play and being shifted around to a different court?
F	The scoreline was emphatic, but she made you work quite hard at times. Does it make you wonder if you can play into your 40s?
F	You've played probably more night matches under the lights at the US Open than any other active player. How did you find your first one at Wimbledon? How would you compare the two?
F	How did you find the atmosphere?
F	You were talking about your opponent's fitness. Do you notice a difference in how hard it is to stay fit now compared to 10 years ago or is it about the same?
F	Did you get any tips from Venus?
F	Could you give me some examples?
F	How much time do you spend in recovery now versus other years?
F	You don't do ice baths or anything like that?
F	Ever?
F	How would you describe where you are in your game right now, what you're most pleased with and maybe, if anything, what you're not pleased with?
F	What about the matchup with Sabine?
F	What do you think you'll be doing at 42?
F	Some different folks that we haven't seen a lot in the fourth round, like Monica Puig, Laura Robson, Sloane Stephens. Your thoughts on how things have shaped out a little differently than maybe anticipated?
F	I think Kimiko hit on the right so fast. What impression did you have of Kimiko today?
F	Laura Robson is into the second week for the first time here. Given the home crowd, do you think she's somebody that people might start to fear the longer the tournament goes on?
F	If you had any thoughts for the younger Americans in this phase, sort of the rookie phase of their careers, what suggestions would you have?
F	You spoke earlier of being very happy where you are in terms of feeling well physically. In terms of the middle of Wimbledon, compared to all the other times you've played here, what is your degree of satisfaction of how you're positioned for week two?
F	What's the comparison between this one and the previous?
F	What is the first thing that comes to mind when you hear 600 wins?
F	500? 100 matches ago.
F	What are your thoughts on the Wimbledon policy year in, year out of always putting more men's matches on the big courts than women?
F	Are you aware that you were the marquee match today on Court1? They put you there because you're the star.
F	It's been so long that you've lost a match. Do you have to remember losses to keep yourself motivated?
F	Of the 600, the most magical matches, wonderful, really close to your heart?
F	What was the difference between yesterday and today?
F	No problem with the grass?
F	How important was that win mentally for you?
F	Do you think you will?
F	When was the last time you felt that you were playing the kind of tennis that you wanted to play, that you felt you were playing really well in a particular tournament?
F	Where do you feel your game is compared to two years ago?
F	Do you feel if you can erase these inconsistencies you can challenge again?
F	What do you think about your next opponent?
F	You're not thinking about what's next after Suarez?
F	We know you're a very private person. There's some stuff floating around now about your private life. Is that something that's difficult to cope with, or have you been dealing with it okay?
F	What is the most important thing for you as you go along in the rest of the tournament if you're going to be successful?
F	You say sometimes in your matches you're a little bit up and down. Why do you think that is? Do you think there's something you can do to work on that to avoid the peaks in the matches?
F	Looking back to last year, was it difficult being the defending champion? Is it a little bit easier this year because you're not?
F	You said it's hard to keep your level during every match. Do you feel tired?
F	Congratulations.
F	Can you explain the turnaround from 6Love?
F	Next round against Flipkens again.
F	Will it be a completely different match than in Paris?
F	Do you rate your chances higher on grass than on clay?
F	You must be happy with the win.
F	Did you approach this match any differently to the last time you played her?
F	Seven breaks of serve towards the end of that first set. Can you describe what was going on there?
F	You played Knapp years ago in Sydney winning 61, 6Love. You probably don't remember.
F	What do you expect now? Today she hit 14 aces, and 80% of points when she put the first serve in. What do you expect from her?
F	How did you stay focused during the twohour rain delay?
M	After the first set that was a little bit tight it got a little bit easier. You found your rhythm it seems out there.
M	After the results of the last few days, people are now talking and thinking about a potential final between yourself and Andy. How do you view that prospect? How do you guard against any hiccups that would stop that from happening?
M	On the eve of the tournament when we asked you about the draw, you said, It's going to be a great Monday. How would you describe now how the two halves of the draw look compared to when things began?
M	What does it say about the unpredictability, though? Remember how things looked a couple days ago and how they look now.
M	You talked about not having dropped your serve. Can you explain a little bit how the grass helps your serve? On the other hand, is grass the toughest surface to return on for you?
M	Andy Murray has challenged Serena to a match in Vegas.
M	Yes. Would you like to take on any of the top women?
M	He thinks it would be a good venue.
M	Imitating her or as yourself?
M	A lot of players go from tournament to tournament and pretty much focus just on the tennis. Others are interested in ideas, so forth. There were reports you went to a Buddhist center here in town. Describe what that was like.
M	So it's like, I don't know, the impermanence that gives it a different perspective?
M	Serena says that after seeing so many players falling and slipping yesterday, she came out there extra careful about her footwork, trying not to fall. Was it in your mind, too?
M	So if Andy and Serena do have this match, what are your thoughts on what you'll see?
M	What do you think the threat for Serena would be to Andy?
M	Whatever you like.
M	With these sort of circumstances, what are your thoughts going through your head?
M	How are you sort of feeling for the rest of tournament and how are you feeling in yourself?
F	I wanted to ask you about your coaching situation with your father. Does he still attend Wimbledon?
F	Was that difficult to actually kind of separate?
F	Was that a decision you've been thinking about for quite a while?
F	Was it easy to be able to separate your personal and professional relationships when your father was your coach?
F	Does he still like to give you vice ahead of big matches?
F	Talk about Wimbledon, first main draw match, what your feelings were before you went on the court and the way you felt the way it went overall?
F	I think you said when you came off court that during warmup, someone was cheering when you hit a ball into the net.
F	First time in your life?
F	You felt pretty comfortable as it went on? You know Heather. You probably hit with her before.
F	How difficult is it playing a home player, a player who is being cheered so wildly?
F	You said once that you liked the loud crowd wherever you played. Would you rather it be loud and against you or just dead silent?
F	So what do you think about this place, Wimbledon? How does it compare to other places you've played?
F	Is there any sense of camaraderie among the young American women that are coming up right now, or is it you're all doing well on your own path?
F	We have all these young players, dynamic country. Do you think you're part of something special, a turn of tennis in America?
F	It looks like from the outside you have a very good game for grass. Do you feel that yet? Are you adjusting to the surface?
F	How much do you practice with some of the other young Americans, like Sloane Stephens and Jamie Hampton?
F	If you see Jamie working out before you out on the courts, does that piss you off or drive you to work harder?
F	What is your favorite part of working with the group, working with the USTA?
F	If and when you imagined yourself playing in a slam when you were younger, did you imagine yourself on grass here or at the US Open? Where was it?
F	What did you make of Heather's performance today? Did you sense she was a little bit flat after her glandular fever?
F	Can you talk about your journey from the start of the year. You started off well, up and down at times, but how it's been because it's more or less your first full six, seven months on tour.
F	Physically how are you holding up since it's your first full year playing a fairly full schedule? How is your body at this point?
F	Has it felt like you've been in Europe like forever?
F	Back in France, Serena Williams was asked to describe herself in one word. She came up with a spectacular answer. If you were asked to describe yourself in a word, what would that be?
F	You've got to be kidding. Do you enjoy the sassy part of life?
F	How did you feel about that last point in the match, the last game?
F	Are you sarcastic with yourself on court in your head?
F	What do you say to yourself?
F	I know it's old news now, but can you believe it's four years since you beat Serena? I know it was only an exhibition match, but as a 14yearold, can you explain what that did for your confidence back then.
F	In that second set when Heather had her good spell, was the sarcastic voice in you saying, Here we go again?
F	How many times have you been to Chipotle?
F	What have you been eating here?
F	Which is basically like going to Chipotle?
F	Watching you on the court today, you were really serious, really focused. Nothing like the person we're seeing now. Is that a real conscious effort to not be your normal self but your player self on the court?
F	As you get more experienced and kind of more used to all this, might we see more of the real you on court in time?
F	You had a very successful French Open. How did you work to build off that for Wimbledon?
F	Where do you think that confidence has come from?
F	What do you think of Wimbledon? First time here?
F	Could you tell me a little bit about your background coming from Puerto Rico? When did you leave there?
F	Will the people of Puerto Rico be aware of this win?
F	So you're a national hero?
F	Did you have any tennis idol when you were a kid?
F	If tennis is a little less popular in Puerto Rico, do how did you get into it?
M	How was the match?
M	Is the problem playing him that you have to go for massive shots all the time, because normal shots he'll get back?
M	Did it help you at all having played him at Queen's?
M	Obviously you didn't enjoy the result, but did you enjoy the Centre Court experience?
M	How far do you think Murray can go in the tournament now?
M	How do you sum up your week?
M	How have the hip and the ankle shaped up?
M	How does it feel now?
M	Do you know what the problem is with the hip, what the injury is?
M	Is this something that could worry you heading towards Wimbledon?
M	I know you said that you wouldn't think about Wimbledon before this match. In hindsight, was that still the right thing to do to compete in this match?
M	I suppose it's part of respecting the tournament, as well, like you said?
M	Did you have any targets coming into the grass court season? If so, will you be readjusting them after this week's successes?
M	Will you reassess your targets for Wimbledon now?
M	We know that you have said that the monkey is off your back with the whole Grand Slam business. When you look back on the time in Paris and then coming here on to the grass, where would you say your level of satisfaction is with your game, and what do you feel needs to be worked on over the next week?
M	Another good win. How did you see it?
M	You had a great start this week. Spending a bit of time in Nottingham last week, did that help?
M	Tsonga next up.
M	And the way you're playing at the moment? I guess you don't have any fear against anyone?
M	Do you think this is a good opportunity for you against Jo being on grass?
M	Are you aware your comments yesterday about women's tennis caused a bit of a stir?
M	Samantha Stosur called them today thick headed. What do you think of that?
M	I guess some people thought it was sexist. Do you want to clarify anything?
M	Have you seen Andy today?
M	Why don't you like women's tennis?
M	So you're obviously standing by your view, your opinion?
M	You're standing by your comments yesterday? That's your opinion?
M	I think you said, I'd never have a woman's coach because I don't...
M	There's nothing wrong with saying there is a difference between women's and men's tennis, is there? Because obviously men and women are different.
M	Do you think it's been twisted around in the local papers?
F	Well done.
F	Do you feel like a genuine grass court player now?
F	Seemed to time the ball perfectly well on this surface. Hard to believe you've had any problems on it in the past.
F	Is it a mental thing as well? Is it mentally wanting to play, is that important?
F	There was even a volley or two in there, wasn't there? You were very pleased with those.
F	Talk a little bit about the difference between the court today. You got through just before the rain. You said that obviously yesterday it was bouncing quite high. Today did it feel a little bit heavier? You said you got off to a slow start.
F	I know you're a bit of a perfectionist sometimes with your tennis. Does grass make that a little bit harder? You have to say like, Okay, it's okay I make mistakes; if I'm going forward, it's the right thing. You just have to change your mindset a little bit?
F	What do you remember of your 2007 run to the semifinals at Wimbledon? Does it feel like a long time ago? What was that whole entire two weeks like for you?
F	When you went into the tournament that year, do you remember what your expectation were or what you thought, or just kind of going with it?
F	Which concert?
F	Do you feel this run here now makes you go to Wimbledon feeling like a contender again, that you can win Wimbledon?
F	Can you describe what it would mean from being a little girl in Serbia to come to England and win a grass court tournament? This one I am thinking rather than Wimbledon.
F	This one.
F	Did you go shopping yesterday after your win?
F	Do you also feel particularly after the French Open, there is a lot change at the top of the game that it's a very, very open tournament, Wimbledon could be?
F	Do you feel like part of the new order or the old order?
F	Commiserations. How did that get away from you when you seemed to be on top?
F	Has to be heartbreaking when you've held match points though.
F	You had some words of support I guess for Andy hiring a female coach, and the girl you played today has a female coach also, Tauziat. Could you elaborate on that? Why do you think that can be a totally awesome choice for a player?
F	Do you think the standard here is improving?
F	Your plans now? Stay here and play doubles and then Eastbourne?
F	Is this a big setback in your Wimbledon preparations?
F	Any positives you can take out of today's match, particularly that first set?
F	(No microphone.)
F	How do you feel about being British No.1?
F	What's it like just in general playing on a surface you probably didn't grow up on? Even being British it's still a bit of a rare thing. How do you adjust?
F	Do you have any words of advice for Johanna Konta? She plays Aleksandra in the next round.
F	Tougher than you expected?
F	Talk a little about Wimbledon for us, now that you've finished here.
F	Shahar Peer.
F	You always seem to get very tough battles against each other. Today you looked a bit tired in the first set.
F	It seemed like you came to the net quite a lot in the first set, but after the first set you weren't able to do that so much. Was that a result of...
F	You clearly enjoy coming here. You've got a good record here. In a couple years' time, there is this new grass court tournament in Mallorca the same week as Birmingham. What if any effect do you think it will have on this tournament?
F	The courts here are very good quality, aren't they?
F	What will your preparations be between now and Monday?
F	Friday.
F	You'll travel back to London today?
F	After all your recent travails you seem very relaxed and happy.
F	Make you stronger, things like this?
F	Congratulations. Is that one of your biggest wins, first top20 player?
F	Does it give you a lot of confidence to beat a top20 player to carry forward into other matches?
F	You have had two long matches, but after a disappointing sort of early exit in Birmingham, do you feel that you are enjoying the time to get some match play on grass now?
F	Your interaction with your coach, it's always fascinating to watch where coaches either are bombarding people with information or there is no eye contact. There seemed to be very softly spoken advice and good interaction. Can you talk a little bit about that.
F	You seemed to be upset by a line call early in the second set, a baseline call. Do you use that anger and challenge your game to make you more focused?
F	Do you feel like you're in the form of your life at the moment? A top20 victory, and you're playing so well. Do you feel like you're playing the best tennis of your career?
F	You were aggressive out there, particularly in the deciding set. Is that something that Diego has tried to work with you a lot and tried to bring into your game?
F	You must be big news in Guernsey, aren't you? Give us a feel for how much interest your career has had there.
F	Last year you said that people usually underrate you a bit on grass because of your game. Now you got your biggest career win on grass. Are you thinking people will realize you're a better player on grass than they believe?
F	A win like this will get the British public very excited about Wimbledon coming up. Is that something you enjoy and you sort of look forward to, the big challenge of Wimbledon?
F	Not a lot of ranking points to defend the rest of the season. Do you feel like this could be a spring board for climbing up into the top 50 and maybe improving?
F	You mentioned that you want to get more aggression into your game. Are you, as a person, are you naturally aggressive?
M	What pleased you most about that?
M	You looked a bit agitated in the first set there. What was that about?
M	What do you have to do well against Richard?
M	Do you feel better getting a roll on with Wimbledon now? Getting in good court time and a good rhythm?
M	When you saw Radek beat Andy Murray, I suppose that was a confidence boost for you?
F	Must be disappointed, but she was very, very consistent. Is that the main thing that got you in trouble today? Just kept getting every ball back.
F	Last time you played together did you notice a big change? Do something a bit different?
F	No, no, her.
F	Del Potro was saying that these courts are fast and playing like grass. Do you feel that way?
F	So you came back in the second set. You were down 41, you came back, and then played one sort of loose game and then it got away from you?
F	You played Hopman Cup and here. I suppose you got as much as you can. You made semifinal here, Australian Open campaign. Talk about how you feel right now. I know you're disappointed.
F	Are you saying the result doesn't matter that much going into a Grand Slam, it's more your form and how you feel you're hitting the ball?
F	Would you rather have this kind of court speed in Melbourne, too? Is this the court speed you want?
F	We don't really know.
M	Good, hard, tough win. What was your take on it all?
M	At the risk of sounding corny, but you were in the box when Lleyton beat Roger up in Brisbane.
M	Okay. Still, Lleyton having a win up there, does that stir you guys on a bit?
M	What was going through your head in the second set? Few double faults, a few loose shots. What was going through your head?
M	What did you take out of the loss from up in Brisbane?
M	I notice there were a couple of your mates in the crowd calling you Mad Dog. Where did that come from?
M	You don't like it?
M	It's a recurring theme every year, but the injuries for players before the Australian Open; been about 30 in the last week that have pulled out of different tournaments. Any theories of why that happens every year?
M	Do you get the feeling there might be a bit of a renaissance round the corner for Australian's men's tennis? There has been a lot of talk the past week or so about the rankings and where they're at. When you look at, what, four Australian guys now in the top 100 and then you got Kyrgios, Kokkinakis, guys coming through. You could have sort of six, seven guys by the end of the year in the top 100. Is that sort of something you've thought about or think might be the case?
M	Lleyton and Bernie obviously dominate a lot of the attention. You're the thirdranked guy. Do you feel like you're fighting for a bit of recognition?
F	How was the match today?
F	12 years difference in age. Do you think the experience helped you?
F	The second set could have gone either way. A few tight service games for both of you. What were you telling yourself?
F	You've had such good results over the past four years. Does it feel easy at this point going out there for a Grand Slam semifinal?
F	Less nervous than your first one?
F	How do you feel about going into another Australian Open final having been there before? What do you learn from those times to this time?
F	Are you surprised, as some of us are, that Cibulkova is now winning 61, 40 versus Radwanska?
F	This score, is this something you would expect or something astonishing?
F	If you play Cibulkova, how do you prepare?
F	When you were younger, you did something courageous. To the Federation, you said you will set your own schedule, keep the prize money, travel. Is that something you're proud of? Would you be here now if you hadn't done that?
F	If you win here, will you send Safarova a note or give her a part of your prize money?
F	Do you think you're playing maybe calmer with that match being so close to maybe being at the airport?
F	So do you feel lucky here this year?
F	This will be your fourth Grand Slam final. First time you probably go in as a favorite by the rankings. How will that feel different for you?
F	You are already the most famous tennis player from Asia of all time. Is that important for you? Does it give you a lot of satisfaction? Do you know that Michael Chang, Chinese background, he won only one slam, and you may have a chance to win two.
F	But the family background.
F	If you weren't a tennis player, how would you be famous?
F	The player you probably will play in the final is from Slovakia, four million people. When things were tough and difficult and you did not feel love, did you ever think to yourself that maybe it would be better to come from a smaller country than China?
F	Carlos was saying you've been visualizing, imagining, to stay calm and focused at this tournament.
F	What are you visualizing?
F	How come a player as successful as you are only one year ago was thinking maybe to retire? Before Wimbledon you said something like you would like to stop. Is that true?
F	How do you explain it?
F	It looks like the way Agnieszka played today makes you so angry.
F	When you won the second set, what was going through your mind at the start of the third?
F	Something particular she did better than she normally does?
F	I think this is the fifth straight match where the higherranked player has lost. Seems like there's a weird vibe around the tournament.
F	How long will it take you to get over a loss like this?
F	You said she played amazing. Talk a little bit more about that.
F	Your shirt, is that the attitude you want to show people after an upset like this one?
F	It's random?
F	Obviously you're very disappointed. Is there a feeling of an opportunity lost, because slams only come around four times a year?
F	Did she figure something out in your game or were you making life easier for her this time around?
F	Are you planning to play Fed Cup?
F	What is your schedule from here to Indian Wells?
F	Just Doha?
F	You talk about your predictability as being a problem. How can you change that up in your game?
M	I was wondering if have you been putting any of your earnings on the roulette table at the casino?
M	You seemed to enjoy yourself out there. Was it a good experience?
M	What do you make of Andy's performance?
M	What was it like signing the autographs at the end?
M	I know you beat Berdych at Roland Garros. Was this the biggest match of your life?
M	After the last match you said no questions about prize money. Now can you talk about prize money?
M	You seem very relaxed for the fourth round of a Grand Slam. Do you see yourself as a bit of a comedian on tour?
F	How does it feel? Good getting an upset like this over Maria?
F	Your best result here. How does that make you feel?
F	Could you tell that she was not 100% physically when you were playing?
F	In the oncourt interview after the match, you spoke about how you had beaten her before in a big game. How important was that selfbelief coming in?
F	Were you bothered by her messing around with her toss?
F	Is that the sort of thing that may have distracted you in the past?
F	When you say she was doing some things on purpose to affect you, would you call that gamesmanship?
F	You know, like kind of underhanded tactics to win the match.
F	Was there any wind out there to speak of that may have affected her ball toss, do you think?
F	How big is the satisfaction then under these circumstances to have won this match against her?
F	When you had your break, your short break at the end of the second set and you came back on court, were you surprised that she was going off court? Did that surprise you?
F	How important was the last game in the second set? You go up 50; she wins four games. Maybe if you don't win that game right there it changes the whole match, no?
F	With Maria and also now Serena out, how big is the chance for you? How excited are you by that?
F	What does it say about you, now you've reached quarterfinals of every Grand Slam which shows some consistency, no?
F	In the first set I think your backhand was more unstable than usual. How did you get through it?
F	First quarterfinal at 19. How are you feeling? Nervous, excited, mixture?
F	Do you give yourself more of a chance of beating Ana Ivanovic than if it was Serena?
F	Did you feel the support from the Genie Army tonight?
F	How many stuffed animals did you get so far?
F	You didn't seem to get very nervous. When was the last time you were getting super nervous in a match?
F	Casey said in the second and third sets the conditions changed a little bit, which she thought helped your game. Did you notice any conditions change?
F	It seemed like you could have pulled away sooner. Did you feel like maybe you could have done that in the first set? Maybe why didn't it happen?
F	You lost in quallies here last year. Now you're three matches from winning the title. Does this feel ahead of schedule?
F	You spoke the other day about how tough it is to win a Grand Slam as a teenager these days. But the draw opens up a little bit now, doesn't it?
F	The level between juniors, like when you won Wimbledon, to now, didn't you find there was a fairly significant jump? Doesn't it surprise you a bit that in a year and a half you're in the quarters of a slam?
F	Why do you think you've been able to transition better than a lot of other junior slam champs?
F	Tactically from watching you in juniors until now, it seems your game has changed the last year or so. You're aggressive, hitting a bigger ball, bigger serve. Did you make those changes specifically because you needed to be a little bit more aggressive on the senior tour?
F	What do you remember about the match with Ana at Wimbledon? What do you think worked in your favor?
F	How is Rod Laver compared to Centre Court in Wimbledon and Philippe Chatrier?
F	How did you keep focused and calm throughout the day?
F	You slept in till noon. How many hours of sleep did you get?
F	What do you do to keep your mind off tennis during a Grand Slam?
F	You watch the other girls or just the guys?
F	Doesn't get you stressed out at all?
F	Who are your favorite other players on the men's and women's tour to watch?
F	What have you made from Ana Ivanovic's forehand?
F	Could you tell us the story of your YouTube of Laura and Genie Gangnam style?
F	You dance around China a lot off court?
M	Where does that rate in terms of tiebreaks you've played?
M	How is the back?
M	Were you worried about it when you had to hurdle the barrier at the side in the first set?
M	Did you have any issues with it being so much cooler today?
M	The pain you have in your back, the stiffness, is it totally different than what you had a year ago?
M	Three straightsets wins. You can't ask for any more than that.
M	When you needed to step it up in that tiebreak, you absolutely did.
M	Didn't seem quite yourself in the early part of the first set.
M	You talked before the tournament about having to get used to being in front of big crowds again. Do you feel that you're sort of into that mindset that you've had before now?
M	You have Stephane Robert. Bit of a surprise. He was a lucky loser.
M	Despite your recent injuries, what's the most difficult aspect of the game for you today? Is it the mental or the physical?
M	There was a picture on Twitter of you and Dimitrov in the ice bath. Happy to see him for the first time in the fourth round?
M	Can you discuss a little bit on how Ivan has helped you come back from your injury.
M	Did they say you had to say something nice about them?
M	Ivan has had a back surgery. Have you talked about yours compared to his?
F	For the matches you played so far this year, was that the most satisfying victory for you?
F	You're always animated. You seemed to be excited with the things you were doing tonight.
F	Did that make it feel a bit like a final, playing Sam at her home Grand Slam on center court?
F	We've heard you say you enjoy different experiences, different matches. It really looked tonight you actually were. You were smiling on court. Is that a reflection of where you are mentally?
F	Your next match is going to be a fair test for you.
F	You often say everything is a process, that the last few years have been a process. What part of the process did this match play?
F	For many young Serbians here in Australia, they are starting their tennis career, you're a role model. What do you think about that?
F	Is it the hard part?
F	What is the most important thing for you when you take the court against Serena?
F	Will it be good to get back on Rod Laver Arena? Do you enjoy it?
F	At the end you did two great lob shots.
M	On a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of fun today, where would you rate this day?
M	I noticed you were a little bit cranky out there. Unusual for you when you're winning. Was that just a combination of it being a long day and wanting to get it over with?
M	Have you played under the lights in the outside courts here ever?
M	You got like a fiveminute warmup?
M	The big forehand that you hit to save set point in the first set of the match, talk about that.
M	When you find yourself playing more defensively, maybe not being as aggressive, do you know what that's triggered by? Is it nerves?
M	Talk about Dimitrov.
M	Do you watch him much, whether it's YouTube or in matches at tournaments?
M	Talk about the match, how you thought you were able to beat him today.
M	Do you feel comfortable on these courts?
M	Biggest win of your life, do you think?
M	How do you feel about that? Seemed to be a straightforward win for you.
M	You have often done very well here first week, and then sort of coming into the second week perhaps not gone as far as you like to get. I know everyone says they think next game ahead. Any ideas why perhaps that might be happening? Do you change anything?
M	About the conditions, obviously there were comments yesterday, people saying that the matches should be stopped when the heat, when it's this hot. What's your opinion on that?
M	In terms of conditions that you played in throughout your career, how hot was it out there? Was that among the hottest you've played?
M	When you knew you were going to be going on court about the time they were predicting the highest temperatures, did you fear the worst about the conditions?
M	How did you find the conditions?
M	From the sidelines it looked as those every component of the game was flowing rather nicely for a first match in a slam.
M	Are you hitting the ball with a bit more freedom since the back operation? You seemed to be able to change direction quite easily, seemed more loose in your movement.
M	Is it strange going on court, given how many times you played in these events, not maybe knowing quite what to expect?
M	When you hired Ivan, you sort of kicked off this recent trend of players with legendary coaches. For the fun of it, if there were an imaginary tournament with the player and the coach teamed up, you and Ivan, Boris and Novak, Roger and Stefan, Nishikori and Chang, how would that tournament happen?
M	Why?
M	When you were with him on the court this summer, did he still have a lot of the strokes? When you were playing that XO?
M	Do you think the conditions were safe out there? A couple players collapsed. A ball boy collapsed.
M	Were you surprised the heat rule wasn't implemented today?
M	Nobody does.
M	Bearing in mind how hot it was this afternoon, you could have had a roof and airconditioning.
M	What's the talk in the locker room? Are people unhappy about it?
M	You play Millet next. Do you know anything about him?
M	Given you haven't played many matches, are you happy with quick wins or would you like the odd competitive match?
M	You said you're happy that Vincent won. Is that...
M	Do you think Odesnik should be on the tour?
F	Was there any major adjustment made in the last 72 hours or a totally different ballgame?
F	You looked far more patient in the points.
F	The conditions suited you a bit more today?
F	How big was the ninth game to maintain the momentum?
F	Mentally what does that do for you, to get one done?
F	You don't often admonish yourself. You yelled at yourself, Stop pushing the ball. Do you remember that?
F	Early days. How is it going with Miles? Tinkering going on?
F	Those little things will remain secret?
F	How much did the crowd come into it for you?
F	Talk about your possible next opponents, especially Pironkova.
F	Pretty impressive heat over the next couple days. Does that play to your advantage?
M	Pretty comfortable first round there today. What do you make of the first match of your season here?
M	You have only lost once before the fourth round here since 2006. The surface obviously suits your game.
M	Your serve was a huge weapon today. Feel good?
M	Any special motivation for the white and blue shirt, like Argentina shirt?
M	Looked like a football player from Argentina.
M	Did you expect the shirt to be such a hit?
M	It's supposed to be hotter the next few days. A benefit of getting off court so quickly today. How are you going to handle the heat?
M	Do you think it's an advantage being a more aggressive player in these conditions rather than a baseline slugger?
M	How do you feel about the courts, the surface? Faster than you remember or still the same as one year ago?
M	Just a few words about Novak, if you can, sealing the yearend No.1 spot today.
M	Probably seem as silly question, but if Wawrinka goes into meltdown tonight and loses, it's possible you can qualify for the semifinals.
M	A little disappointing end of the year, but what is your opinion of having this event move to another city in the future or staying here more years?
M	Can you say anything about why it's so hard for players to stay in the matches once they fall behind?
M	You've had experience the last couple years going from this tournament to the Davis Cup final. Wawrinka and Federer are going to have that experience this year. Can you talk about what that transition is like, changing focus from this to a different kind of event.
M	Marin Cilic said the other day how tough playing Djokovic in the first match of the tournament. You played him in the last match of the round robin. Do you think it's even tougher to handle because you are under pressure to try to many games as you could?
M	Talk a little bit about your offseason, what you're going to be working on. Is it an important one for you to try to make some big changes or not?
M	You're older than Nadal, Murray and Djokovic. You're four years younger than the No.2 player in the world. Where tennis is going, do you think you're around your prime age? Is your peak still to come? Are you already past your prime given where the sport is now?
M	The court is different than other covered courts or was it Roger that played well in the key moments?
M	What's the situation with the wrist? Where does it place you going ahead in the tournament?
M	You've made rapid progress since Michael Chang became your coach. How much do you think the performance of an athlete can be put down to the coach? Can you give some advice to the Chinese young male athletes?
M	For a good part of your career, you've had troubles with injuries. Was there a change at some point for you in the training you did off court, especially with your game being the way you grind out points? Was there something you changed in how you train?
M	This has been the year of your breakthrough. That obviously comes with a lot of media attention, especially in your home country. How do you cope with that?
M	We've been talking a lot about your relationship with Chang. What is it like with Dante? How is the connection between an Argentinian and a Japanese person? How difficult is it to have this barrier of culture? How do you cope with that?
M	Last year in Madrid you beat Roger for the first time. You said he's your idol. It was a great year for you this year. Do you think Roger is still getting better?
M	You are obviously 10 years younger than him. Are you surprised how fast he still is, how fit at the end of a long season? How do you feel now at the end of the season physically?
M	I'd like to know if you see any young Japanese coming behind you? Do you know anyone who could be tomorrow your partner in Davis Cup, maybe winning when you will be 33 like Federer?
M	Can you calculate how many millions you've earned with that low crosscourt slice of yours?
M	It's going to be a big ask, but you can effectively finish the year at world No.1. What sort of target did you set yourself at the start of this year and what would it mean for you to finish the year as the world's best player?
M	Because of the successes of this year, how quickly you were able to adapt to the new racquet, what are the goals for next year? What do you want to accomplish at this stage of your career?
M	The poppies that people wear here, when did you first notice it? Also the show earlier this week?
M	You've played Rafael Nadal 33 times, a few times here. You've now played Djokovic 36 times, also a few times here. Which rivalry do you think is the greatest of your career from your own personal appreciation of it, and for fans and the sport, between those two?
M	Today's match, what was your read on the match as a whole? In the second set, it looked like you were getting frustrated or confused about whether it was your game, something Raonic was doing.
M	An obvious first question: How do you explain your domination of Kevin Anderson? Your good record, we'll call it.
M	Is it something to do with the fact you read very well his serve? For instance, he's a big server. Is there any explanation with that?
M	Looking further ahead past London to the International Premier Tennis League, can you talk a bit about that? You're committed, I think, to playing in all four venues.
M	With London, you just qualified by winning today, so congratulations.
M	Does it still feel exciting for you, or is it something you expect at this point? Because you have qualified quite a few times now.
M	You play nine times this tournament. You reach six time at least the quarterfinal. Is there any explanation, or what do you especially like in this tournament? Because the surface change more or less every year, so is there any explanation about the fact that you play well here all the time or most of the time?
M	What are your memories of nine years ago?
M	Do you wish there was still more fast indoor tournaments? Because everything is pretty slow now.
M	What do you think it is about this tournament that a lot of different guise have won it? You won a Masters Series here, only one, I think. Soderling and Ferrer won their only ones here. What do you think it is about a lot of different guys to win it?
M	Today you served at 52%. First question is: Is it more gratifying to pull through in a match like this where you struggled and you had to come back from breaks? Second part of the question is: Do you need to serve better in your next match, or what do you need to do in your next match?
M	So the doubles and the singles. What does it inspire you?
M	But you're not injured? The thigh is okay?
M	So you haven't had many victories. Is that going to be a problem for the upcoming Davis Cup?
M	Even if you say you were focused on this tournament, aren't you already thinking about Lille?
M	Do you believe in the end that maybe it's better in a way that you lost? You'll have more time for the Davis Cup final.
M	Can you tell us how you're gonna spend the rest of the week here and the next week? Are you going to play a lot of tennis or are you going to get some rest before? How are you going to adapt to clay?
M	Stan, who just came here, said that there were many other important events in the end of the season other than the Davis Cup, and he didn't want to think too much about the Davis Cup. He could be injured before that. And for you, is it easier? Simple? Just playing here, playing the Davis Cup?
M	When you were young, do you have a precise memory of a Davis Cup final that you maybe watched on TV and that you were...
M	What is your opinion on Roger Federer playing here, playing everything? Do you think it's crazy, it's a risk he's taking?
F	Have you ever won a trophy that's too heavy to lift before?
F	How does it feel?
F	Earlier this week you said you couldn't believe it if you were to make the final here, and now you're the champion.
F	Did you think about that going in?
F	Did you talk to anybody else or just your father?
F	They're tired?
F	I know you're saying it's still very early and you're realizing that you've won this, but what can something like this really mean to you with the length of career that you've had, and last year where you came so close to retiring?
F	How hard is that, I guess, psychologically? Because the way tennis works, you play a lot of weeks in the year, and almost every week you have to end almost by losing.
F	Winning a million dollars, are you paying for the dinner?
F	Even before the injury you broke into the top 10. Is this still a goal then or a dream then? Did you think you could win a premier mandatory tournament?
F	Physically over the course of two weeks and all those matches...
F	What would you rate higher: being the first Italian to be in the top 10 or winning this?
F	Well, just like having to decide on playing Aga the other night, yes.
F	How much sweeter do you think it is, given that you were thinking about going away exactly 12 months ago?
F	You're up to No.12 now in the rankings.
F	At some point this year it could happen that we have three players in the top 10 32 years old. Why do you think that is? With the success later in the career? What's your thought on that?
F	But just the maintaining of your body and being fit is the toughest part?
F	Getting the trophy at this moment, does it feel to get more throughout the season according to how you feel right now, or is it just...
F	So are you going to update your autobiography, your book?
F	On that, though, Li Na put out her book in English and then she won a big tournament, the Australian Open, an Englishspeaking country. So when are we getting English version of your book?
F	We hear good things about it.
F	What was it like for you to win the title, to go over to your box, and then Fabio dumps water all over you?
F	Did you ask him to stay, or did he volunteer to stay?
F	(Question regarding Jose Perlas.)
M	After 55, you got on that roll against him. Can you talk about what happened from that point on to take control of the match.
M	I don't know what to call it, it's not a renewal, but reinvigoration of freshness in your career now. Talk about how that feels, and is that something you're proud of that you have achieved this in your career?
M	In many ways does it surprise you at all in that joy is a central part of what's happening?
M	It's been a fairly unusual tournament. I think only two of the top 10 guys made the quarters here. Guys outside of top 10 say they feel more belief now, especially after Stan's win in Australia, that they can breakthrough. Do you sense that? What do you think took so long for the rest of the guys really starting to believe they can start to beat the top guys?
M	Did you sense when you were on court ever that those guys, they felt like they couldn't beat you? Did you ever get that sense when you were out there?
M	Were you worried when you saw that weird wind blowing through here it might stay around and affect you later?
M	Over the years you have been extremely effective at neutralizing
M	Over the years you have been extremely effective at neutralizing big servers. Same was true tonight with Anderson. Is that something you have always been able to do? Do you work on it? How are you able to read serves like that so effectively?
M	Earlier this evening Alex was asked about playing you. He said, Well, what do you want to know? He's won 17 Grand Slams, broken every record. Figure it out. Turning the tables, what are your thoughts on playing Alex?
M	I don't know if you happened to see any of the Stephens/Pennetta match earlier, but there was a bunch of oncourt coaching. They kept losing games after they had their coach come out. Wondered if you thought how it might work on the men's side and how you might use it, if it has a place in tennis, oncourt coaching?
M	Do you think it's something that diminishes the women's game?
F	How did she compare to the way you expected her to play the match?
F	Where is your confidence level right now?
F	You said you're you not feeling 100% physically. Where are you kind of aching right now?
F	She complimented your defensive game. Have you really worked on that, and can you talk about that?
F	When you say that she is a great player, what is it about her game that you find dangerous?
F	You said you were nervous in the second set. Why were you nervous?
F	Does that give you confidence, that the last two matches you've been able to not play the best tennis that you've ever played and win, or are you worried?
F	What was your small injury?
F	Which leg?
F	You said this match was very important for you. Why? The size of tournament? Is it that the opponent was younger? Up and coming? What was will particular reason for the importance?
F	What did you do before the match? Before it started you left of the court for a minute.
F	What about at the end of the second set? What did you do?
F	Just to change your mind?
F	Do you feel physically well enough to win this tournament?
F	You have Dellacqua in the quarterfinals. That's not the usual opponent you would expect at this stage, so what are your thoughts on that?
F	Do you think it's an advantage or disadvantage that she had a walkover this round?
F	Very nice fight out there to get through a difficult match. What was your general take away from it?
F	We saw Michael Mortensen is here with you, but I guess your dad is still doing the oncourt coaching. Can you talk about that setup? Is he considered your coach now or consultant?
F	Was that like a language thing? I know Ana Ivanovic has a Serbian coach, and she said that she likes being coached in Serbian. I think Bernard Tomic has the same thing with a Croatian coach now. Is there any sort of like player like you grew up playing tennis in Polish?
F	Key phrases he uses? Obviously we don't understand. He gets pretty animated sometimes.
F	I think you played her last year and lost in straights. How much do you look at that match the night before and talk over what you're going to utilize on court?
F	Are you doing that on YouTube, like Googling clips, or...
F	A few players have been weighing in on how good their prep or bad their preparation was before coming into this event. Just checking in with you, how happy were you with, yeah, your practice or preparation coming into here?
F	I think I saw you the other day running to the site. Your dad was waiting for you with your bag. That's something you probably can't do very often on tour.
F	Is that like a little bit of head clearing time for you, too?
F	You guys stay at a house?
F	Aside from the four slams, do you think this is the best tournament in the world? And do you think it should become the fifth slam?
F	When does Rory get here?
F	With the ring in hand?
F	When you look back on your career, is there one shot that stands out that you're most proud of?
F	One shot.
F	Do you ever dream about tennis?
F	When you are up close and personal with golf or walking the courses, they are great sportsmen, but how do you compare the two? Ball is just sitting there, no opponent, it's sort of...
F	Have you gotten madder on the tennis court or the golf course?
F	First match here. How did you find the conditions? How did you like your game today?
F	How did you feel about your opponent's game?
F	The ball can move very quickly through the court here. Have you found that to be the case? And also, do you have to adjust your game to, you know, fall back a little bit more, or do you try to stay still on the baseline and adjust your timing?
F	Kurumi said she looked up to you as a role model in terms of play style and games, because you are not that tall, as well. She said your play style is similar to her.
F	What kind of treatment did you have on your feet to make it better?
F	It feels perfect now?
F	You've obviously won a lot of matches this year, more than the past years. Does winning still feel special, or is it something normal at this point?
F	Do your results affect your mood like outside of tournaments? Do you feel happier now that you're winning a lot more?
F	What do you do to keep your mind off tennis outside of tennis?
F	Do you like to watch tennis on TV?
F	Not at all?
F	I talked to a number of other players and commentators and they speak very highly about your game. They like the way that you play, balanced, tactically, and things. Why do you think that is? What is it about your game do you think makes it special?
F	Have any of the Romanian women players from the past had any influence on you?
F	Do you see her every day? Is she here?
F	Did you know what the scenarios were for qualifying before the match?
F	But in the second set, had Maria won in straight sets, then that would've obviously knocked you, I believe, out. Did you know that? And then did that kind of explain the fight back?
F	If this was your last match of the year, does the way you fought back in that second set, even though you lost the match, make it an okay note to end on?
F	If you do happen to make the semifinals, what do you think you would like to work on to be ready for that?
F	Your fate rests in the hands of your friend. Did you give her an extra pep talk before she walked on the court?
F	Are you going to go out there and watch her? There's probably space left in her box. If she wins, you win, so might as well go out there.
F	If it was your last match of the year, how would you sum up your season?
F	Aga, obviously the round robin is specific to this tournament. I'm wondering, especially with the white group there were so many different scenarios. How did you view that? Is it more exciting or nervewracking? How do you view the situation that the group is in today.
F	In the event that this is the last time that we talk to you, I have to ask the question, what are you doing for vacation?
F	Aga, in the second set you were 51 down. What was going through your mind? Did something happen to inspire the comeback?
F	In that second set that you hit that overhead; you missed it badly. Then after that, you completely relaxed and played as though, yeah, you had already checked out. Was there a little bit of that?
F	End of the season, compared to the previous few years, are you as tired year as you were last year, year before? How would you compare how you feel physically at the end of this year compared to previous years?
F	Obviously that didn't go anywhere close to how you wanted it to. What did you feel was not working for you out there today?
F	Did you have any inkling in the warmup or before the match that your game was maybe not at its best today?
F	You played her before, but over a year ago, and she's really made a big move this year. How different was she than what you expected or remembered from her?
F	You looked obviously frustrated on court. You look a little bit emotional now. Can you talk about why this is frustrating or why particularly you're feeling the way you are?
F	You did have those two chances to break back in the final game. Do you think if you did that she might've got a bit nervous and you could have turned the momentum back around?
F	Ton of unforced errors from you, which is unusual. Did you try to change a little bit? The forehand wasn't usually working for you, which you usually dominate with.
F	Unlike most tournaments, you lose here and you can keep going at this point. How did you reboot and shake this off?
F	Do you like that you getting to back out there in two days? Is that a positive? Negative?
F	You mentioned your serve and your forehand, but also did you feel you were moving as well as you could have? Was there anything bothering you with your movement?
F	You changed racquets more than usual. Was something not feeling right on that front?
F	So 100% you feel okay? Are you moving well? Does the leg hurt?
F	That seemed to go really well for you. Did you expect it to go so well?
F	You walked out on court with a bit of a smile.
F	How different does this tournament feel from anything else you've ever done?
F	Can you tell us since Wimbledon, the change between your matchup against Genie, what do you think has changed with your game and her game since then?
F	Your first appearance at the WTA Finals. Do you come here thinking this is just an opportunity for experience, or do you think you really have a chance to do something at this tournament?
F	We don't know who you play next. Do you know?
F	Right, so Serena.
F	You haven't played Serena yet this year, so what is tat going to be like for you? And it's surprising, because you were 2 and 2 for a while.
F	How different will you feel about going into that match than last year when you played her? You've obviously won a lot since then.
F	Were you happy with your movement today?
F	Was it better than you expected?
F	Has it been easy to forget about your recent results and injuries coming here?
F	The buildup to this tournament seems bigger for the players in terms of all of the photos you have to do and all the press.
F	What was that like for you? That's a lot of stuff to do for the first time.
M	Go back not too far in tennis history and McEnroe was playing singles and doubles, semis every week of the year. How do you view tomorrow?
M	Do you think when you play on such a quick, fast court your level of confidence is higher?
M	How did you find playing with that a fanatical corner of fans on his side?
M	Talk about Chardy.
M	He said when he meets you in the locker room you always make a lot of jokes. Is that true?
M	Two days ago I was lucky enough to have a quick chat with Toni Nadal, and he suggested for a top player it's better to play Brisbane as the leadup to Australian Open than Doha. What are your thoughts? Was that a factor in your decision to play here?
M	I know you don't like to think beyond the next match, but have you given any thought to the possibility of Lleyton in the final? You used to play together. You're good friends.
M	Andy, at the end of the first set, at the beginning of the second set, there were quite a few times you looked into the air when you served. What was wrong at that moment?
M	What was going through your head after you let Djokovic take game one of the second set off those four errors?
M	How would you judge your performance overall as a barometer of where you are at the moment, your form at the moment?
M	You should still be pretty happy. You took the wild card to play here. Can you talk about that.
M	At the US Open you said the World Tour Finals and qualifying just wasn't something you were going to concern yourself too much with. It's looking like the race is going to be tight towards the end of the season. Is it something now that's on your mind or are you just taking it tournament by tournament?
M	Djokovic was able to win 74% of his second service points. Why did you struggle so much with his second serve?
M	Is Amlie coming to Shanghai? Why was the decision for her not to be here in China with you?
M	The cooperation with adidas, the contract with adidas, it will end at the end of this year. Will you renew this contract or find another sponsor?
M	On the court, you are cute. Many fans love your smile. Apart from the competition, what is your evaluation on your personality and character on court?
M	You were very aggressive from the getgo on this match. Was that intentional to try to keep Rafa on the defense the entire time?
M	You played against Rafa in previous matches. Your matches are always so close. Is this the most big achievement for your career and how did you accomplish it?
M	I understand in the first round of qualifying, you were very close to losing, down 15 in the second. Talk about that.
M	How will you go about preparing for your match with Berdych tomorrow?
M	You talked about the belief, still being able to come back even though you were down in the second and third set. Tactically, what do you think you were able to do today that bothered Rafa?
M	Was there any sense this was just Rafa's third match since Wimbledon? Did you think he might be vulnerable, bestofthree instead of bestoffive? Did you go in with a little bit more belief than you had in previous matches with him?
M	In today's match in the first set you had a breakpoint first, and then Nadal broke again. In the tiebreak, you lost. In the following two sets you were able to win the match. Are you capable of doing the reverse win points?
M	In this match, beating the No.1 player in the world, what does it mean to you? Does it mean in your future career you'll be more confident when you play top10 players like Djokovic, that you will not be fearful, and you'll be more brave when you face these players?
M	I noticed after your victory, in addition to writing your name, you wrote something. Does it mean anything?
M	You never lost to GarciaLopez in your career. How did that change your mindset going into the match?
M	You've always played incredibly well through Asia and through the end of the season. How do you stay motivated during this part of the season? A lot of other players seem to struggle, it's the end, no slam waiting at the very end.
M	Just to catch up since the US Open, what have you been up to? How much time did you get to rest? When did you get back on the courts?
M	I think this is the first tournament you've seen Viktor back on tour. Your thoughts on how well he's been doing since he came back?
M	Last week Viktor played in Shenzhen. He talked in the tough times it shows who are the real friends, that you supported him publicly, and others did not. Can you talk a bit more about your friendship.
M	You just said you're fighting for the world No.1, which is a big motivation right now. Another thing you're expecting right now is the birth of your first child. The question is, when will be the predicted date of birth of the child, and will that affect your plans for your next few tournaments: Shanghai, Paris and London?
F	Can you talk about what you did after the second set to get yourself back in.
F	You broke serve to win both sets you won. Talk about the mental process there. She had some trouble with her serve, especially in the third set.
F	Probably going to make some highlight shows with the behindtheback backhand.
F	Even though you felt a little bit off today, you've had some great wins this week. How are you feeling overall? Obviously excited about being in the semifinals here.
F	Seven of the top eight seeds are out. Are you surprised with the way the draw has unfolded?
F	Just overall, are you surprised?
F	(Through translation.) Hello, sweetheart. First I'd like to congratulate your advance to the quarterfinal. Tomorrow you will meet your opponent, Timea. What do you think of her performance, and how do you evaluate her?
F	At this point you're kind of winning on a regular basis, easy clip getting into the quarterfinals and stuff. Can you compare your mentality now and kind of almost maybe the expectation to win compared to maybe earlier in the season where there may be a few more doubts, I would assume? But maybe I'm wrong.
F	So you have been obviously coming to China and playing in China for quite a few years now, and I'm wondering, have you noticed any changes whatsoever with respect to kind of how tennis is in China at this point and how it, you know, perceives WTA tennis, what the fans are like, those sorts of things?
F	I saw you getting to talk to Li Na when she came onsite for the visit. How is it kind of catching up with her and what did you guys talk about?
F	(Through translation.) First I'd like to extend my congratulations for advance to the quarterfinals. Since we all know that you entered the semifinal both in the US Open and Tokyo, did you have more confidence in advancing to get the semifinal in Wuhan Open?
F	First of all, congratulations. I have two questions. One is that we know that you're still fighting for qualification for the WTA Final in Singapore. To you, how important the Wuhan is? And the second one is, as close friends, we know that you and Serena, I mean, she does the retire from her first match. So what's your opinion?
F	Just going back to what happened today on the court, have you experienced that sort of like heat stroke before in matches or is this the first time?
F	I have to ask, because your English is remarkable, so why? Why are your language skills so great?
F	Where in the States?
F	In Bradenton or...
F	What brought you over to the States? Just tennis?
F	I would imagine. So you came over with your parents?
F	But now you live in China?
F	And train in China?
M	For a straightsets match, that was pretty close, wasn't it?
M	What was the powder on your back about?
M	You played a lot of tennis this season. How are you bearing up physically?
M	You have a 71 record against Kohlschreiber next. You must be quite confident going to the semifinal next?
M	Just a followup, Philipp was in earlier, and he said that what he's been doing the past eight attempts hasn't worked, and he's going to try something different. I mean, does that give you, you know, confidence, someone is coming into a semifinal against you and feeling he has to change his game plan to beat you?
M	The other day you were talking about all your results in Grand Slams. You have made it to the semifinals in all of them. Do you consider yourself unlucky to have shared the same era with Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal?
M	In Jo's first three service games, missed only one point, and then you almost broke him. Did you change anything? Is there any explanation towards that?
M	Just a great comeback in the third set there. You must be delighted to be through, a tough game against Florian.
M	You're playing GB in Davis Cup and you have chosen obviously clay. I wonder if you think that was the right choice, given that GB beat the USA on clay to get to the quarterfinals.
M	What could the GB team expect in Naples? What would you expect the atmosphere to be like?
M	Kohlschreiber possibly next. Could be tough. 8th seed here, I think, 7th.
M	You're one of many 30yearold players in the draw here.
M	I'm trying not to be rude (laughter). What is it about the tour at the moment that so many I mean, you've got Tommy Haas, I mean, looking at the Germans alone, Tommy Haas, 35, reaching top 12. Has the game changed? Is it the tour that's changed?
M	Talking about the rankings, you had your highest position last January. Do you think you can be back into the top 20 in the coming months?
F	An eventful day. If we can start off with your singles opponent, knocking out Radwanska, how do you feel about that?
F	How much would you say that the fact that you have to qualify and you played four games whereas Aga is coming in cold as a seeded player, did that help that you're climatized to the conditions?
F	When you have a long losing streak against someone, I mean, did you do anything differently today or do you go out uninhibited?
F	Radwanska mentioned the conditions out there. What did you make of the conditions? She was saying it was blustery?
F	Venus next?
F	Your thoughts on that? She dismissed Ana Ivanovic.
F	Just a few words on your doubles today. Obviously with Sam, winning that.
F	Is this potentially a longterm partnership with Sam?
F	How is the wrist doing?
F	Like what percentage better, would you say, 100%, 80, 60?
F	You haven't had that much success coming to Doha and Dubai. Can you just talk about why do you think that is? Is it jet lag? Is it just playing somewhere very different than where you spend most of the year?
F	Can you talk about the match today? It looked in the second set that  I think you broke her toward the end. Just talk about mentally how it was for you and what made the difference in the end.
F	What went into the choice of Paul? Is he here with you?
F	Are you still working with him?
F	What made you go on to him? What do you think he could offer you?
F	To this point, what's been the better tips he has given you? Not necessarily of your game but just in general.
F	Is there a little part of you that wished that maybe last year, not that you didn't do as well as you did, but didn't make such a splash, that you could have gone under the radar a little more?
F	No, at the beginning, your whole last year with the Australian Open semis and everything, maybe not making such a splash in like the news and everything, more under the radar?
F	What do you feel you learned?
F	How do you compare your mindset now to a year ago when there was this huge media attention and everything after Australia, and now that you've been consistently doing well in Grand Slams, do you feel that mentally you're stronger and different now compared to a year ago?
F	Genie is following a similar path that you did last year here. Has she talked to you at all about it or anything?
F	There aren't that many players in the top that are as young as you are, so do you feel this generation gap makes you a bit detached than everyone around you, or is it lonely at all on the tour for you?
F	Without Paul here, and you said everybody sticks to themselves a bit, so after a day like today, how would you just make yourself feel better or put the things into perspective?
F	What's next? Indian Wells?
F	Would you stick around here for a day or two to hit with players, or are you leaving right away?
M	Must be extremely happy with your game today, not only that it was so quick, but your movement. You played so fast today sometimes it was too fast to see the ball.
M	You're playing another gentleman from Spain.
M	45 minutes the other day, 47 today. You seem in a particular hurry at this tournament. Something you're doing differently? Is it a conscious thing?
M	It was just rumors yesterday that you didn't practice or you had some problems, physical problems?
M	The wrist?
M	Gone?
M	The wrist improved compared to your last match?
M	It's obviously very early to say this, but do you think this is the most confident you've felt starting on clay?
M	What do you think about today Fognini's behavior?
M	You've had more time to prepare for the tournament this year. Did you feel the previous years it was a little bit too short?
M	A football question about the World Cup. Do you have one big memory when you were a child watching the World Cup?
M	You can think about it and answer tomorrow, if you want.
M	Which country?
M	And Monaco is not represented either.
F	You repeated the title in Stuttgart, but Madrid was like a new place to win.
F	Simona was very complementary on the way you played. For me it was much more important to see how relieved you were at the end. Even though you almost achieved everything in your life, it was very important for you to win this tournament, and not only this tournament but so many others. What is this love that you have for tennis?
F	We also saw you giving nice words to Dinara Safina. Let's saw health is the most important thing.
F	I just want to know about your relation with Sven, who seems to be a very competitive person as well.
F	Do you think this relation will last many more years as it can be?
F	Do you measure the success of cooperation with them...
F	...on your titles, or how do you measure that?
F	How are you going to celebrate tonight?
F	We saw some of your matches with not so many people. We know the tickets are sold, but what would you say to Madrid's public? Only Nadal, or it's okay in any case?
F	Is it special for to you win a title on clay?
F	After winning two titles, will you try to change the preparations before Roland Garros? Will you try to play as much as you can in Rome?
F	Sometimes it's hard to see you smile, but in Madrid you are happy. You are having in a good time in general apart from winning?
F	Congratulations on the win.
F	It was a tough match. Just wondering, which are those big events in your life that provided you with that mental toughness to go through those matches?
F	You play with Li Na a couple times on clay. Why do you think you have this mental edge against her on those few occasions? You were down in the points and she was leading; she seemed to almost have this match, but you fought back and won.
F	You said you didn't play so well in the first set. Do you think the way you came back, particularly in the third set and your form in recent weeks and your form in Stuttgart, that you're approaching your best form?
F	On a wider aspect, are you in favor of oncourt coaching? Do you think for you particularly that it works?
F	You may play against Caroline Garcia. Can you tell a little bit on her?
F	Max a trying to organize a few exhibition matches between you and Li Na in China after the Singapore Championships. What are your thoughts about this idea? Do you think it's a good thing for the Chinese fans to experience, to see two great players playing tennis in front of them?
M	Congratulations, David. Feelings? How did you feel out there?
M	Now you have to play against Gulbis. Do you feel comfortable with these opponents here in Madrid?
M	Today you started playing pretty late. How do you feel about that? Is it very strange for you, and do you prefer to play at another time? Tomorrow it's late, too.
M	You know, I see that you were doing really well returning his serves. Have you changed something, the nerves for example?
M	Talking about the returning of the serves, were you more concentrated today than with Albert Ramos?
F	Talk about the second set.
F	You beat Christina McHale here last year in the second round. Did you expect a match so complicated this time?
F	The work with Sven is bringing you new things? You feel more secure? The objective is to beat Serena or just to be better by yourself?
F	In what way is it helpful for you to be able to have the coach on your side during the match compared to the times where that wasn't so? Does it really help you?
F	Well, the coaches weren't always allowed to come and see you.
F	Yes.
F	Yesterday we saw all the tennis family out there on the court. Did you know Elena?
F	You are playing Sam or Garbine next. Obviously you have played Sam a lot, and also you played Garbine I believe in Rome last year.
F	What do you expect from both?
F	If you could just talk about the game, how did you leave it inside the central court, and what happened?
F	Can you say that you came back in the second set? You were fighting? You were aggressive?
F	You had a little bit of success when you came to the net a couple of times. Did you think about doing that, or was there anything else you could have done differently?
F	What's your sort of emotional reaction to that? Do you feel disappointed or do you feel that when an opponent plays as well as that it's inevitable? How good do you think she is?
F	Would you go away and think about playing her differently next time? Is that something you'll do?
F	Quite a match. I think she had a 31 lead in the third set and you came back. You just really kept after her. Talk about how you feel.
F	Was it something you did or something that she did or a combination?
F	I believe it's only the second time you have ever beaten a top 3 player. Radwanska was the other one. She's the reigning Australian Open champion. That must give you a lot of confidence for where you are at the beginning of the season.
F	Congratulations for this wonderful win. How do you feel after this big surprise of beating Li Na, No.2 in the world, and qualifying to the next round?
F	How do you keep yourself calm? Because it's a great win, but then there is tomorrow. You have to come back and play. A lot of players, after a big win, have trouble keeping themselves calm and in the moment.
F	Did you feel that Li Na tired during that match?
F	Yesterday Li Na had difficulties to win her first game. For you it was very possible today to win?
M	Is it happy birthday?
M	So the first question will be how do you manage to get so fast from your defense and you're on the net like so quickly? I don't see nobody else could do that. How do you do that?
M	Were you able to get up to anything special or fun in the city before you made it here today?
M	Wondering what it was like to have the crowd break into a spontaneous song of Happy Birthday for you in the middle of the match.
M	Do you have the feeling you lost your concentration after such a good start at 20?
M	Yeah.
M	The fans, the reaction of the fans, how did it affect on your playing concentration? Would you like the fans to be a little quiet and it would be more helpful for you, or when they are screaming and calling your name gives you more energy?
M	Can you talk about Rogers Cup. What's your perspective on this tournament? What do you think about the tournament so far?
M	What was the problem leading up to this tournament for you?
M	Can you assess today's match against Donald Young? How did you feel it went?
M	How concerned are you about those little dips in concentration when you're not in the match? Is that the difference between you being at the level you're at and then being No.1?
M	Tommy Robredo next. Can you talk about a matchup against him?
M	A lot of the top players take a break after Wimbledon, as you have, as well. Do you think that helped you, having the break, or in hindsight maybe you were just better to go with the momentum you had at Wimbledon?
M	Can you share please how are you going to prepare mentally for the next match?
M	When you get out there during the match, do you find yourself that you can focus point by point, or does sometimes your mind wanders, thinks of other things, yet you're still in control?
F	What made the difference today?
F	How good is it for your confidence for the next match?
F	How does it rank for you as a victory to win over such an impressive player?
F	How were you able to manage and keep your focus and control during the rain delays?
F	Tomorrow you play either Jankovic or Vandeweghe. Do you have thoughts on them?
F	You were in the semifinal in Washington. It seems to be going really well. Have you made some changes or...
F	How do you change from French to Wimbledon, then Wimbledon to hard courts? Which do you find more difficult?
F	After the match, there was long minutes with the towel over your head. I'd like to know what your feelings, your thoughts at that moment. Were you also crying?
F	Congratulations on a fantastic tournament. Can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how different it is for a player walking into their first Grand Slam final, and how does a player manage these emotions?
F	How tough was it to adjust your pace of play? She appeared to be very slow. Were you surprised that it nearly twoandahalf hours before she got a warning for time from the umpire?
F	Simona, 44 in the third set. You had a moment yeah, this is the moment. What happened between the umpire and you? I thought there was like you was about to serve and he turns and tells you something.
F	Technically speaking, what do you think the difference was in the match? What did she do better than you maybe thought she would? What did you do either worse or better?
F	It did look a little hopeless in the tiebreaker for you. Can you just talk about where your mind was when you were down so far in the tiebreaker.
F	And you fought so very hard; so did she. It was a very tough mental battle out there. Talk about her mental toughness, her ability to fight. She seemed to come back again and again when you were trying to...
F	It was a great final. The public obviously loved it. Now, besides lacking Grand Slam experience, an hour and a half later, what do you wish you could do better in this match? For instance, did you come to the net enough or maybe you were lacking some confidence in your smash? What did you think you could have done better to improve your game?
F	What have you learned about yourself over these past two weeks?
F	On a happier note, I know how much you love shopping. Do you have any plans? This is a nice check you're going to walk away with here.
F	It seems that not only the Romanians that were here but French people, the public, they were also beside you, a lot of them. How did you feel this?
M	You said it was going to be exciting. Was that a bit too exciting in the end?
M	Can you talk us through the conversation before the start of the fifth set? Monfils came and said he really wanted to play and felt he tried to win too quickly because he wanted to play and stay on. What was your view of the decision?
M	Does having a fourth set go 61 against you and the 60 in your favor in the fifth feel less unexpected when you're playing a guy like Monfils who you sort of expect the unexpected against?
M	How did you feel physically in the fourth set? Was it he was playing too well or were you also feeling the effects of the long match at that stage?
M	Your second semifinal here. Have you exceeded your expectations a bit from the beginning of the tournament?
M	How big of an achievement is it to get to the semifinals here?
M	Gal said he thought you were more tired than him before the start of the fifth set. I'm wondering whether you kind of tricked him to believe that you were more tired than you were actually, and whether you did like what Gal did to Fognini in the previous match, he took advantage of the fourth set to recover a bit? Was that something you did?
M	Have you ever played in darkness like that? Was it in terms of your career slam matches perhaps the most undulating in terms of scoreline?
M	About the same.
M	How much can you take out of the match that you had with Rafa in Rome into the semifinals?
M	Is there a difference going into this semifinal with him because you are, like him, a Grand Slam champion? You know how far you have to go to win this sort of thing. Does it give you a mental sort of hardness maybe you didn't have back in '11?
M	This is only your second Grand Slam after back surgery, so do you feel that physically you're ready to compete with Rafa over five sets on clay?
M	He obviously likes it if it's hot and sunny, so would that play into his hands, do you think, if the conditions are like that, or you'd like that too?
M	Going back to the Fransen conversation, was there not part of you that was thinking he was so good in the fourth set that there would be a case of getting off now and coming back in the morning?
M	Do you consider it the toughest challenge in tennis, playing Rafa here?
M	Does any part of you think it's a little odd in 2014 a worldclass major event like this can still be at the mercy of daylight, that lights should be something they would have?
M	Can you speak about what happened today? You played very well in the fourth round, and today was very difficult for you. Can you explain what happened?
M	Do you have some explanation about that?
M	I just want to ask you, you've seen Ernie play for a while. What do you think about his game today? What do you think of his chances against Djokovic?
M	Where do you start your grass season? How do you look at your chances for Wimbledon?
M	You talked about the top guys and you have to bring your best against the top guys. Gulbis was not really to be called a top guy. What do you think makes the difference in him? Is he now better than before, or was it just he played good today?
M	You had difficulties with your serve. It was because of Ernests or the conditions?
M	Can we say that today he beat you like kind of at your own game? Like you had to maybe try something totally different to try to deal with what he was giving you back?
M	A fast, hard groundstroke game?
M	Sometimes it seems if your game doesn't work you don't want to like just keep the ball in play; is that right? Is it too boring for you? You like playing longer rallies, higher over the net, or is it completely crazy the question I put?
F	Looked like you got a little frustrated in the second set when you threw the racquet. What were your thoughts at the time?
F	What do you think was the difference in the third set when you came back?
F	This is not about the match, but writing about coming up and financial burdens and challenges. How much does it cost to play on the tour, and how do you meet those challenges?
F	Is that basically the dividing line, top 100?
M	Obviously tough to get into those sets getting down a break early in each one. Talk about just overall how you felt in the match.
M	Just frustrated at not being able to get into his service game a little bit more?
M	He's 6'5", and I don't think people appreciate how he moves. Talk about how that helped him today.
M	How about your journey here? Best you've ever done. How does that help you going forward?
M	How big a deal, if any, was getting broken in that first game?
M	Anything you can pin that on or attribute that to?
M	There are different roles in American sports that are kind of special, and one of them is being No.1 in tennis. Kind of a tough time to talk about it, but if you wouldn't mind, can you talk about what it means being the No.1 American.
M	Obviously the only guy in the top 60. Do you think some of young guys are showing signs of doing more? Can we expect to see some even better results on the grass coming up?
M	Do you know or have you practiced with any of the young juniors? Like Tiafoe Michael Moe or Kozlov or any of those guys?
M	Seen them?
M	Any thoughts on him?
M	John, grass is next, which has probably been your weakest surface. What is it about it? Is it the low bounce?
M	Have you ever watched old tape of some of the big guys that used to dominate in the '90s?
M	You've been on the circuit now for a while. In your own thoughts, what are you most proud of as a tennis player?
M	Any thoughts on what the key is to get there?
M	Finally, if you could have changed anything in your career  I know it's hard to go back  but anything you would've done differently?
F	Great match. How do you feel after this great victory for you, second time in the fourth round here in Paris?
F	How did you feel in your tennis today? Everything was going good for you?
F	From the beginning of the match, you were in your match until the end. It was okay for you. Even if you lost one match point at 52.
F	You have a love story with Paris. You played very well in Coubertin? Do you remember?
F	Next round? Svetlana Kuznetsova? How do you feel about that?
M	Obviously very unusual match. Just overall, what are your thoughts on all the changes that happened throughout the course of the match?
M	Do you think the penalty point you had in the last set was deserved? And also, we noticed you had a long chat with the supervisor. Can you explain to us what that was about?
M	How did you feel on this court? It was said that Suzanne Lenglen is very different from the other courts.
M	But the clay was the same as on the other courts?
M	After observing your pattern of behavior in a lot of your matches, it might seem like you like the fact that maybe some fans don't like you as much as maybe they like other players. Do you enjoy that or...
M	But the fact that, you know, when we hear those boos, I think maybe some players would go home and cry. You clearly aren't affected.
M	What were your thoughts during the fourth set when it didn't look like he was trying at all? Looked like he was saving energy for the fifth set. What were you thinking as that's happening?
M	What were you thinking while it was happening?
M	Would you say you're the biggest talker on the tour and what does it to do to your game to talk that much on the court?
M	That's what you notice in general.
M	There were several moments of tension actually between you and the box of Gal Monfils. You told them several times to be quiet. Can you share some thoughts about that?
M	No, I saw that. I was behind the box.
M	Fair enough.
M	When you're on the court, do you want people to like you or do you not care?
F	Kristina, when she beat Li Na, she said the match after is a little bit tough. How tough was it for you to get back on the court after beating Serena Williams?
F	What made it difficult mentally? Like when you say it was difficult mentally, what does that mean?
F	Do you think that you're still handling it, or are you now settled for the rest of your tournament? Because you have a nice opportunity here to make a good run.
F	Can you talk about kind of what your life has been like over the last 48 hours since beating Serena? Take this match aside, but phone calls, interviews? I mean, how much has life changed for you?
F	Have you heard about Gulbis' comments today about professional tennis players? He said he hopes his two sisters won't become professional tennis players because women need to think about having kids and enjoy life. What is your opinion about these comments?
F	What's the sort of tennis background in your family? Am I right in thinking your brother played a little bit on the tour?
F	Did your parents play?
F	Your brothers' names?
F	Is there a feeling in the locker room that the young girl is ready to take over the older players who have won a lot? Is there a feeling, okay, our time is coming finally?
F	So do you get your mobile phone back, or does your coach keep it for the rest of the tournament? What's the deal?
F	Can you just talk about potentially your next match. I don't think we know your opponent yet. Mentally going into that match, what do you think?
F	Congratulations on your match. There is no doubt that the results are up to what you have achieved in Australia. From Australia to the French Open, have you made great strides? Are you more powerful?
F	On the court, you like dictating play, but outside the court, do you dictate play or not?
F	In life, how are you in life?
F	If you get a good result with Suarez in the doubles, will this have an impact on your decision for the Fed Cup?
F	An Englishman asked you a question about your mobile phone. But have you heard about this situation in Venezuela following your success?
F	Are you prepared to win the tournament? Because you are one of the favorites now.
F	The president of the Tennis Venezuelan Federation has said to the government that the government should speed up things so that you continue along these lines. I mean, two countries are vying to get you.
F	So following the win against Serena, is it true that you haven't read the newspapers, that you haven't watched the news?
F	You're going to play against Mona Barthel or Pauline Parmentier. Which players you don't want to play against?
F	You are a player who might be one of the favorites for this tournament. Do you have some pressure?
F	Another very solid match for you here. Things feel like they are coming together this week? Do you feel that you're still moving forward?
F	What is it about this place you like? A lot of Americans over the past recent generations have not always loved it here.
F	Is there anything that's different about the majors? Is it just the atmosphere? Does it pump you up more? Any sort of effect on you as opposed to the lesser tournaments?
F	What's feeling like at the moment in the changing rooms with the top two seeds gone, do the people who perhaps came here feeling they didn't have a chance feel they really now have a chance? Is it time to make a name?
F	But do you think there is more pressure now because everyone, with the top two gone, there is more of a chance because logically it's always going to be about Serena, perhaps Li Na, but with them gone everyone really it's open season for people who are left?
F	On the tour and maybe in Fed Cup the results earlier this year were not the greatest, but things are sort of clicking here. What are your thoughts about that in terms of American tennis?
F	American performance here at this tournament.
F	In general. Yes, the general American performance at the French Open this year.
F	Do you talk to some of the other players, or do you just focus solely on your own path?
F	You were at Wimbledon last year when the draw sort of broke apart and things got crazy. Did that sort of change your mindset at all when you were one of those last eight players and you knew that you were maybe one of the higherranked players left, even though your ranking wasn't as high as normal, yet you were one of the higherranked ones left in the quarterfinals? Does it sort of all heighten things, that one experience, when you look back?
F	When you talk about extra things happening with girls?
F	Paul had tweeted you might have a tougher practice after discussing his technological deficiencies. Did he follow through on that?
F	So you guys made up, that's good.
F	A lot of players have routines at a tournament. Do you have a place where you eat for dinner? Do you stick to the same thing?
F	Which is?
F	Do you get out much here and if so what things do you enjoy doing?
F	Long day for you, eh?
F	How if any, being now the topranked American in the tournament now, have any effect on you, if any?
F	How did you wind up playing doubles with LucicBaroni?
F	You weren't planning on playing doubles here?
F	Just helping a sister out?
M	Last time you beat a top10 player was Andy on clay. Do you feel that on clay is your best chance to beat him?
M	Can you tell us about your present run? You won the title in Dusseldorf, and it was your first title in two years. Is this the best you've played for some time?
M	And how tough an opponent do you think Andy Murray can be?
M	If you could choose a surface to play him on...
M	It would be clay?
M	Tell us a bit about how you got into tennis in your childhood and so on, your mom and dad and how you got into it.
F	The conditions weren't easy today. Tough first set and little by little you find the range?
F	Li Na lost. Serena lost too. What are your thoughts on the big surprises and consequences for the draw and everything?
F	Talking about a new generation. We have Garbine upset Serena and Kristina ousted Li Na and we had Townsend ousted Cornet. Well, are they really coming, the young girls, or just for the moment?
F	More challenge or motivation of the new girls coming for you?
F	You said you were in the middle, but you had been around for a long time.
F	I don't mean that disrespectfully.
F	Do any of the younger women coming through come to you to say, How did you cope when you came on the scene and you got a big win and then had to deal with a lot of pressure, a lot of expectation on you? Did they come and ask you, Maria, how do I go about maximizing my potential?
F	Wawrinka and Li say at some point the pressure was too big on them and they couldn't handle it anymore. You have done this since a long time now. What's your own way to deal with the expectations from outside?
M	How did you feel out there today? How do you feel about the match?
M	Seeing favorites of the tournament, men's side and women's side, losing, is it sending an extra warning to the ones who remain in the draws?
M	Wawrinka when he lost, he said that suddenly it has all become way too much for him, the pressure, expectations, and that we don't realize how hard it is for you, Roger, and Rafa, to do it weeks in, weeks out. Can you reflect on this a bit?
M	Speaking of 2008, do you remember the kind of feelings you had after you won your first major? What did you struggle with the most?
M	I want to ask you about the football World Cup. Who is your favorite and why?
M	Since you're an expert in tennis, then, if we asked you to pick the favorite for the women's title now that both the top two seeds are out, who would you pick?
M	I have a question but it's not really about your game. I'm writing an article about tennis players in the top, I don't know, 30 that are not living in their own country. It's generally for training purposes and also people are saying maybe for tax reason. I was wondering for you when you decided to make that decision, what is the rationale, and what are the advantage of when you took that decision a few years ago?
M	Playing Marin Cilic next could be the very first test for you in this tournament?
M	What do you think of the clay here compared to other clay surfaces? How dirty does it leave your socks and shoes and basically your body?
M	What are you feeling about this match? Was he a better player? Or maybe you were not in top form.
M	In this match your coach told you to return better, to step into the court, but it's very difficult to step into the court against such an opponent. In terms of shots, you were quite good, weren't you?
M	It's very difficult to give your feelings after this defeat, but what are the lessons learned from that match in order to improve and get better?
M	What's next?
M	Laurent Lokoli belongs to your same generation; he's made a breakthrough. Do you feel like emulating?
M	I didn't want to say that you wanted him to lose, but, I mean, you were born in 1994 and you are one the best players.
M	How about your back?
M	A question regarding your draw yesterday, Wawrinka was eliminated. He was on the same draw as you. Does it open up the draw for you?
M	You come to Roland, you're not at 100% of your capacities, but you can play. Is it difficult to manage mentally, to be here and to think you're not 100%?
M	What about the practice when you decided you were able to play Roland Garros last week?
M	We've watched you serve, no real weaknesses in your motions. Now, in the next round it's going to be more difficult, he's a clay player. Do you think you have the physical capacity to put up with a strong fight?
M	But the good thing today is that you won in three sets. That's good news?
M	Dimitrov was eliminated by Karlovic. You played several times with Karlovic. Why is he so difficult as an opponent? His serve?
F	Last week in Strasbourg, Alize Cornet said she was extremely upset about being booed by the French fans. Have you had experience with that?
F	She said she was upset about being booed by the fans at her firstround loss. I wondered whether you had had experiences of that in the past by the French fans?
F	Do you think that sometimes the French fans get behind the male players like Tsonga and Monfils more than, say, the leading French female players?
F	Do you feel that the public, the French fans, they sometimes get behind the players like Tsonga and Monfils, the top male players, say, than the top female players?
F	Back to today's match, the first set was very close between the two of you; the second set was more difficult. Can you explain the fact that the second set was more difficult for you?
F	What was your injury exactly?
F	The second set, in the end she neutralized you, as you say. Was that also due to the fact that you were lacking physical condition. You were not in very good shape?
F	How did you hurt your rib? During a match?
F	Roland Garros, you don't have that many Roland Garros tournaments to play. Are you going to try to enjoy every minute?
F	Yes, but when you walk on court here...
F	I'd like to ask you about the relationship between the French players and the French crowd. I know it can be quite variable at times, sometimes it can be difficult. Do you feel they are maybe more demanding of the French players than foreign players?
F	They expect so, so much.
F	Do you feel that the crowd sometimes tend to get behind the French male players a little bit more than the female players?
F	When, for example, like last week in Strasbourg the crowd being not quite so nice, how do you deal with that?
F	How do you feel after this first victory as French No.1 here in Paris?
F	How does it feel winning in 58 minutes?
F	But it's also very important for the rest, because your objective is week 2, so you want to save energy. Do you have this in mind when you walk on the court?
F	I just wanted to know what you thought about this dancing battle between Monfils and Lokoli, who won. And why didn't you take part in that battle?
F	Laurent overdid it. He was dancing, making the show, gave a press conference before his match today. You were successful when you were young. What do you think about it? Isn't it dangerous?
M	You had your chances in this match in the second set. How did you feel on the court? What was maybe the key in this match?
M	Do you think it's still a learning process at this level or a bit of tension?
M	How comfortable were you playing on the clay?
M	What's the biggest challenge returning his serve?
M	What do you take away from an experience like this? I know you did well here last year beating Stepanek. Now that you've come back again with a bit more experience, what do you actually walk away with?
M	How important is it to get on the court, as you haven't been able to in the last little while?
M	Just about the priority of having to keep your body right to play now.
M	Is it mixed now you've got?
M	How do you feel about the grass?
M	Have you set yourself any particular goals this year in terms of ranking?
M	Is there any particular area of your game that you've set yourself that you really want to work on, something special you want to improve?
M	Getting off the track a little bit, tell me, what's your setup here in Paris? Where do you stay? Who you are with, how you prepare.
M	Where is that?
M	You've been playing quite well since Cincinnati, US Open. It seems like the season has turned around for you for the last month or so. Can you give us some insight into how that's happened?
M	Have you done anything different with your game in recent weeks? You've beaten three top10 players since the US Open.
M	How was it playing against an opponent like Feli, very good slice, powerful serve, dominant at the net? How do you feel you played today?
M	Six years ago in Shanghai on the same court you defeated Roger Federer, then lost to Djokovic in a close match. Tomorrow you will play one of them. Can you give us some memory of the Masters Cup? What do you think about the final?
M	Gilles, you played consistently well for the last few weeks. Now is it almost like you're going to have to go up another level because these guys are so good at the moment? Do you feel you have to take the game up a little bit higher?
M	It's your second time in an ATP 1000 final. Compared to 2008 Madrid, how different a player are you?
M	Will you stay and watch Roger and Novak play or go back to the hotel and watch on TV?
M	You must be much more pleased with that effort than you were last night. Did you feel everything was clicking a lot more tonight?
M	What's the toughest part of the overnight recovery for you?
M	Julien Benneteau has beaten you a couple times. What makes him such a difficult opponent?
M	The Milan legends team was here, and Paolo Maldini said you were his favorite tennis player. What do you think about that? Have you met him after the match?
M	Do you know that you have a Chinese nickname? It means you are the king of getting a lot of points such as breakpoints and game points. What do you think about that?
M	When you meet with so many points, what do you think about when you meet with these points? You will think about, I will win? It's very difficult.
M	That's all. Thank you.
M	Can you talk about how you felt out there tonight. Was it a little bit of an adjustment coming out here to Shanghai after Beijing?
M	What happened in the middle stages of the second set?
M	You always put great importance to not just playing the matches but the physical work you can do in the gym and so forth. How does that work out playing three tournaments in a row bang, bang, bang?
M	You've had, what, two days off. There was traveling. But do you get in the gym any of that time or is it all court work with a racquet in your hand?
M	I noticed after the game, your signature on the camera. Did you draw a heart or a butterfly?
M	You got a set this time, so that's a start, right?
M	Tell us in your own words how you saw it.
M	By the conditions, you're talking about the wind?
M	You were 3All in the third set. He had everything going after that. What came to your mind after that point that was so decisive in the game?
M	After winning the first set and going down 4Love in the second, what was the situation there? Did you have a little bit of a letdown at the same time he boosted his level?
M	Quarters both here and Indian Wells. Are you happy with that?
M	Where did you feel like you were?
M	How do you feel to be so close to be the first Canadian to beat the No.1 tennis player in history since 1992? What did you learn for the next tournament to come?
M	Can you say anything about the things you're working on that you are working on without giving away any state secrets?
M	Is it disappointing now that you seem to be getting in better shape you're going to play on a surface that doesn't suit your game as much as hard courts?
M	Does it change something on how you're going to prepare for the clay court season, the fact that you're much further ahead than you think you would be at this stage?
M	You're back in the top 10 this week with your result. Is London a realistic goal for you this year, do you think?
M	What's your schedule like heading up to the French Open the next few weeks? What are you planning on?
M	Yeah.
M	So as many matches on clay as possible?
M	Jo's obviously a dangerous player, and first set showed that. Where do you feel like you grabbed the momentum? Early in the second?
M	Did you feel like you broke his spirit at one point when you won like 12 points in a row?
M	You kept looking up at your box and commenting Three years. Can you tell me what that was in reference to?
M	(Regarding Martina Navratilova as a coach.) Given the influence of your mom, love for WTA tennis, is that something you would ever consider, having a woman coach at this stage?
M	Do you feel like your game is coming together here? Once again it's a Miami issue, kind of your second home. Does that really affect you?
M	Do you have any kind of arrangement with Ivan? Like, did he say, Give me a call; listen, if you have some troubles or if you want some advice or if something's going on, feel free to call me?
M	There was a part of the match where Jo started to close up his game. He was starting to play very close to the net. Did you feel that could be threatening for your game, for your match at all?
M	What is your opinion on Juan Martin Del Potro is likely to miss the rest of the season because of a wrist operation?
M	How much of your success here this last couple of years do you think is directly attributed to how comfortable you are here in Miami?
M	How are your hips feeling? I know there were some painkillers. How has the pain level been?
M	Is it worse than usual?
M	You haven't played Novak since winning Wimbledon, which was obviously a big day. To what extent, when you're facing somebody with whom you have such a long, you know, history, do you think back to specific matches, or is the last match you had together relevant at all? What can you expect in the quarterfinals?
M	Does it seem weird playing him in the quarters instead of later in the tournament?
F	Obviously tonight was a tough night. Anything other than just things weren't firing for you tenniswise? Anything psychological?
F	Throughout that whole match were you thinking of, Hey, this next point is where I'm going to be able to find the rhythm?
F	Always nice to have the crowd on your side, but does it put a little extra pressure on you to play in front of a home crowd?
F	Have you felt this coming? Problems in practice or anything? I know you said during warmups you kind of get settled down or something. That just not happen today?
F	What do you try to adjust or change something?
F	Are there days that are so bad that they are almost easier to get over than, you know, something kind of in the middle range?
F	Do you feel Caroline was a bad matchup for you?
F	Did you feel that it was going to be a bad night from the very start? Was there a point early in the match where you thought it wasn't happening?
F	Do you go back out tomorrow and/or do you take a day?
F	Retail therapy?
F	There were some harsh words on Tennis Channel saying they were not sure if you were trying to act cool or if you didn't care tonight during the match. What would you say in response to that?
M	Other than your haircut, what's changed since last week? You seemed a little bit different on the court in terms of body language and some other stuff.
M	You kept your head up a little bit more.
M	I mean, last week sometimes I don't want to get don't want to you to get creeped out about how closely I was watching last week, but sometimes you were keeping your head down. You had just different facial expression.
M	Rafa has said today that he would like to play in a Masters 1000 tournament in Latin America. Do you agree with him? Would you like to play there?
M	In South America, Latin America, Brazil.
M	How do you see your opponents right now? How do you see your main opponents, the shape they're in right now?
M	After your win on Sunday, you spoke about how important the Masters tournaments are. Obviously you get a thousand points as opposed to the 2,000 from the slams, but do you think you can have a good season like you had back in 2011 when you sort of dominated?
M	How far will you go in this tournament? How many wins?
M	I wanted to ask you a little about footwork. It seems like one of those skills in tennis that people don't really pay attention to. There is so much attention on the shots and the serve.
M	Talk to me about how that part of your game has evolved and how much emphasis you put on it. Is that something you train at or...
M	Did you see what happened and did you know what happened at 53?
M	You played a very efficient match tonight obviously against a tough opponent. How much of the fact that you got it done so quickly had to do with the very late start? With all due respect to Milos.
M	Seemed like it just I'll give you an analogy.
M	Rafa plays pretty slow, but when the rain clouds are out there, he plays pretty fast.
M	How tough was it to get ready? Looked like the match may be over a solid hour and a half before it ended. How tough was it to follow that, especially when you're not expecting that?
M	Were you watching or just keeping a sense of what the score was?
M	What do you feel like was the biggest difference tonight for you to get the win?
M	You've played for so long and you have a bank of players, memory bank full of players and styles and tendencies. Does Milos remind you of anybody? Is there somebody he reminds you of that you could draw upon?
M	This is your second Masters 1000 final in a row. Just want to get your thoughts. Last week it was you and a bunch of guys, and this week it's you and a bunch of different guys. Andy, Novak, and Rafa are sort of not currently that stage. Do you have any thoughts on do you miss them? Do you think about it at all? Or you just doing your thing?
M	Does it feel like it's been two years since you won a Masters title?
M	Would it be a significant milestone, sort of coming full circle to last year's injury to lift one of these?
M	That was obviously a tough match, John. What are your thoughts?
M	In terms of quality and your form, how does that rate, that match rate, for the hard court season? One of the best? "The" best?
M	What about the atmosphere out there? Seemed like it was a pretty cool match to be a part of, in general.
M	You mentioned things you could have done better. Anything that stands out that you'll take from this match moving forward?
M	Would it be fair to call it a confidentboosting loss just because of your form? Returned well; serve was clicking; volleys were good.
M	I have a technology question not about this match. I am doing a story on these Cool Seats being tested on the tour. They were used in Washington during the changeover. It's a cooling gel that you sit on. There is also a vest. Have you tried that out?
M	Would you try now?
M	Something you sit on. It's a cooling gel.
M	So the heat doesn't really like...
M	Andy was saying he could hear the interview happening off court.
M	Do you prefer playing on courts that have kind of a smaller runback? Does that kind of give you a little bit more confidence and freedom on your serve?
M	What's the hope for accomplishment next week in North Carolina?
F	Obviously a tough turnaround physically, but just talk about that a little bit. Disappointed to get your match ended so early on Tuesday?
F	When did you get in, Sunday or Monday?
F	Parts of your game that you weren't happy with or didn't feel were up to snuff?
F	Is it hard to get used to playing deep into tournaments every week?
F	After what you did last week, do you look at this as a setback at all or she just played...
F	How happy are you with your US Open prep overall?
F	When you won the challenge near the end and won the last game, did you feel yourself gaining some momentum there?
F	How does this alter your plans? Do you stay here and practice? Do you go home and practice?
F	You look so sad about that.
F	In Canada, were you surprised by how well you were able to bounce back day after day after tough physical matches, or is that what you can expect from yourself now?
F	For those of us who weren't there, can you just address a little bit the fact that it's been a while since you had a win over Serena? You got so close, but you have also had a great career rivalry.
F	You have had some good success at WTA events, but haven't quite been how you'd like to be at the slams last couple of years. Anything you'd change in your approach going into New York? Try to change something or I don't know how you focus on that?
F	It was a little windy out there. When your toss gets wonky and everyone's does once in a while, do you ever feel bad or embarrassed after catching it after you toss it up?
F	Has there been talk with Serena about playing doubles in NewYork?
M	I am going to ask you the same question that I asked of Roger: How important was that first game of the match?
M	What can you say happened in that game looking back?
M	How do you feel about your level of play today?
M	This may not be the best time to ask you the question, but I'm going to do it anyway. We've been talking all week about what it's going to take for one of you challengers to knock the big four off their pedestal. Can you tell me what you think it's going to take?
M	Having seen you serve so spectacularly in the previous couple of rounds, psychologically is it harder to serve one of those big aces when the last thing you see when you look up is a player the caliber of Roger Federer at the other side of the net?
M	Is there more pressure to hit the corner of the corners when it's someone like Federer on the other side?
M	Today was the first time you played on Centre Court for this tournament. What was the atmosphere like, especially playing with Roger?
M	It seemed especially at the beginning that he had your patterns picked, that he was almost there half the time before you even hit the ball. Were you aware that he seemed to be anticipating well? How difficult is it to change those patterns or do something different on the fly when you're still trying to win a tennis match with your goto stuff?
M	We talked a lot about your serving in this match. Roger's serve was pretty dominant. Can you talk about what makes him so difficult to return against and what you feel you need to do to improve your return.
M	You were complimentary about Roger's achievements before the match. I wonder who you think is going to win the final. If Roger prevails in the 8th title, where would that rank him in terms of the history of tennis?
M	This is probably the biggest tournament ever in Canadian tennis history. Are you going to stick around to watch Eugenie? You did in Australia.
M	Has it been difficult making a parallel run from your side?
M	After all this time, what is the number one thing you'd like to do now?
M	He said he took that end because he had the wind behind him. He ended up breaking that first game. Are you aware why he made that decision?
M	As you got on the court near the chairs, he seemed to say something, are you going to sit there or something like that. You remember that?
M	Did he say anything?
M	I need to know what eating unhealthy means. What are you going to have? What does the next couple weeks hold for you?
M	Seeing how Roger will turn 33 next month, seeing how he played today, that he'll be rising up to No.3 in the rankings, do you think you can still be playing at the top of the game at that stage? Does it also make you more patient knowing that players in their 30s can still be near the top?
M	What's the most important thing you learned over this tournament, in your opinion?
M	Judging from everything you said, I know you won't be satisfied with how this tournament's finished up, but are you proud of what you've achieved overall? Will you be able to channel that moving forward for the breakthrough Grand Slam win that you obviously crave?
M	How much did yesterday impact on today?
M	Did you get an appreciation for how Rafa must have felt yesterday?
M	Could you give us an idea what the last 24 hours have been like.
M	What does the past nine days tell you about what you can achieve in the future?
M	Are you aware that in terms of public awareness of you, money, the players now are aware of you, that your life is totally changed over the last two days and it will never be the same again?
M	How do you plan to deal with the pressure that comes with expectation, having made the quarters here?
M	What were your plans post Wimbledon coming into the tournament and how much have they changed by what's gone on here?
M	When you take yourself back 10 days or so, how do you reflect on what you've achieved throughout this whole period at Wimbledon?
M	There's been talk about you changing coaches and what the future holds for you. What are your shortterm plans and what is the situation with the coach?
M	The crowd seem to love you out there. Any idea why that might be?
M	What sort of opportunities now to be top 70, main draw at all the slams, getting into more events. That's clearly an opening for you, isn't it?
M	You mentioned yesterday how you've been used to playing in front of small crowds on outside courts. What difference does it make to your preparations to be playing on show courts, historic courts?
M	Great individual success this week. How important is it to you now that the other bunch of Australian guys sort of the same age start delivering some significant results along with you?
M	If they're beating you in practice, what is it that brings out the best in you in match play?
M	Will you watch the DVD in the months to come?
M	Having measured yourself against the best in the world, what are you going to work now? What have you seen about your game that needs improvement?
M	Did you sleep much last night or were you still playing half volleys through your legs at half past 3:00 in the morning?
M	Have you got the mental toughness to take you to the next level?
M	When Milos was your age he was ranked like 350 in the world. Now he's in the semifinals. If you come back here in a couple of years and you've done the work, it's all gone to plan, do you think you've got the game to actually win here?
M	The reaction to yesterday, did the prime minister send you a message or anything big like that?
M	Who were you rooting for at the end of the second set of Kyrgios and Nadal, the older guy or the younger guy?
M	What did you observe?
M	Your last match was the best you'd ever served. Was this better than that, the last three sets?
M	Speaking of your serve, Kei just said he couldn't read your serve at all. You are very intelligent player. Maybe that's why he couldn't read your serve. Can you talk about mixing up different kinds of shots. Talk about what is the key of making that many aces.
M	I think there were seven breakpoints in that first game. I think we'd only seen you face one breakpoint. Tell us a little bit about what it's like to try and regroup after each one, sort of how you felt after losing the first game in the first set.
M	You're the first Canadian to reach the quarters here for 102 years. Do you feel you're a part of history, on the verge of a breakthrough in a major? Will you be joining a Canada Day celebration anywhere tonight?
M	Earlier in the week you talked about how you watched the big four and how you learned from them. What did you learn from Nadal on court and off court also?
M	Should we be surprised that you're not serve and volleying that much? You almost do it more on clay courts. You're not coming to the net all that much. Is it a specific plan that you have to work points from the baseline, or does it depend on the situation?
M	A lot of highprofile players have complained about the scheduling because of the rain delays, having to play consecutive days. Does that give you encouragement? Do you want to take that momentum forward knowing they're unsettled?
M	It's Canada Day. Could you talk about the pluses of your Canadian experiences as a family and how it's helped you as an ATP player? Except for Air Canada losing your luggage, what is the downside?
M	When you came to San Jose.
M	Certainly if Nadal wins the match, you'll probably be on Centre or 1. How much will you appreciate getting onto a big show court?
M	What if it's Centre Court?
M	You just said previously you lost to Kei two times. This time did you change your tactics or approach in today's match?
M	What is the key for you tomorrow if you play Nadal, and same question if you play Kyrgios?
M	I wonder how you would describe your own game so far at Wimbledon this year. Good? Bad?
M	Is grass not good for you?
M	What does it mean to you to be this far at Wimbledon?
M	How did you keep yourself occupied and focused throughout your day off?
M	Did you practice on Sunday?
M	That must have been important then to keep the focus rather than let it slip?
M	Can you describe your relationship with Michael Chang, and how important is his influence to you?
M	Do you think he has more understanding about Asian players?
M	With you only playing four games today, would you have preferred to have played your next match today as well?
M	For nine years four guys have dominated the majors. What is most important that you've learned from observing, both on and off the court, the top four?
M	What are some of the things you've learned from them?
M	You said something interesting about Michael, that he might understand how you do things, the Japanese way. Could you take a moment and explain that.
M	He's a very positive guy. Is he good to be around?
M	Outside tennis, how do you relax? Japanese way or English way, how do you relax? Do you ever relax?
M	Obviously tennis is big in Japan because of your success. Do you have any sense that your success is helping put down roots which will make tennis big 15, 20 years from now in Japan?
M	How do you feel now?
M	Did you prefer to keep playing on Saturday?
M	How difficult it was to keep concentrated on Sunday? You have to wait 24 hours, so...
M	Who do you think felt more pressure going to the court today: you or Kei?
F	You had a look on your face that you almost looked guilty when you walked in here.
F	How do you feel in the hour since this win?
F	You said you couldn't play on grass a couple years ago. How bad were you and how did you improve?
F	What happened after that first set to get you back into this?
F	You scored a notable victory over her in Dubai earlier this year. That was great, but it wasn't a Grand Slam or a tournament of this magnitude. She said she didn't think about it. Did you think about it?
F	Did you employ the same tactics?
F	You said right now you wanted to play simply. What does that mean for you?
F	What are your thoughts on the keys to your next match?
F	Serena said girls raise their game against her. Did you go in today knowing you had to raise your game?
F	Early in the third set you were both at net, and she hit a winner and she screamed loudly. What did you think at that moment?
F	How often do you kiss the court after a match?
F	Many players have admitted to feeling intimidated by Serena. You clearly aren't in any way, shape, or form intimidated by her. Were you ever intimidated by her? Why do you think the intimidation factor isn't so strong anymore?
F	What is it about your game that makes you bring your best against the best players? You've played seven matches against Americans this year, and you lost to players lower ranked. Doesn't make sense.
F	Yes.
F	You said kissing the grass was new. What are some of your regular superstitions before and during a match?
F	Earlier this week Benoit Paire told the press that he hates the grass, he hates Wimbledon, he wants to go home, he's happy he lost. You're talking about how much you love it. Is this the most mental surface in tennis, grass?
M	Congratulations. Can you just talk us through your assessment of that match?
M	Tell us what you think of Lleyton Hewitt as a competitor. There is some suggestion that this is probably his last match at Wimbledon in the singles and maybe his career.
M	Been suggested this will probably be his last match in Wimbledon and maybe his career. Who knows? Tell us what kind of competitor he is.
M	What happened in the match when you were down two sets to one, two break points? Of course, great serve, but do you think you were a bit lucky as Fognini said or not?
M	What was the problem with your back?
M	You got a bit of treatment on it?
M	How does it feel to be the first South African to get this far in 14 years since Wayne Ferriera?
M	If were to face Andy Murray, how would you feel about that?
M	You've beaten him before.
M	Fabio is the kind of player that's known to have quite the temper and sometimes it's a bit distracting to play him. Going into the match, is he the kind of player you dread facing because of that?
M	Does it bother you?
M	It says in your profile that you like reading. What was the last book you read?
M	Electric? Acoustic?
M	You said you got nervous before going out today. Is that an issue for you?
M	If you played Murray it may be centre Court. That really steps it up.
M	If nerves do affect your physical state and your back today, are you worried going into a match against Murray? That will be extremely physical.
M	In all five sets you played today you already started to serve first game. Is that an advantage for a guy who serves like you? Did you choose at the beginning to serve first? What happened when it was 52 to you in the fourth set and he gave the last game, which was stupid on his side, in my opinion, because you start the fifth set serving.
M	Really?
M	If you look down your past record you can see which big names you play, but doesn't tell us the big stadiums and how crowded they were. Which were the biggest crowds you played in front of?
M	On Ashe?
M	Were you around on day one when he walked out and got that long standing ovation?
M	Is Andy somebody that you well? Have you practiced with him?
M	Were you surprised to be on Court 17 today?
M	Did this annoy you?
M	I understand you're a big fan of Eminem.
M	If you play Andy, will it be a bit of Marshall Mathers to pump you up before?
M	Were you more nervous meeting him?
F	So you did rather better against her on grass than on clay a little earlier this year. What are the reasons for that today?
F	The gap has been closing with the surfaces to be sort of level. Have you found it's less of an adjustment to play on all the surfaces?
F	Do you still prefer grass, or do you not like to think of it that way?
F	How do you feel about repeating last year's successes here? Are you confident now?
F	One last question on the surface: Are the adjustments you talk about more subtle? You don't change your game from surface to surface much, do you?
M	Bad luck. What was your assessment of the match?
M	There was a problem with the hip? What was that?
M	To what degree do you think that hindered you in that fourth set?
M	And the subsequent niggle what you're feeling.
M	Do you feel like the evidence of that match suggests that you can match up with the top players?
M	I think you probably slip out of the 100 because of the points you defended. What's your plan to get that back on track?
M	What's your exact schedule from here?
M	Which events?
M	At this point is there anything you can learn from a match like that, or is it just one of those things you move on, put it behind you? Is there anything you can take from it?
M	Schedulewise, is the plan after the US Open, will you just keep playing as much as you can? Is that what you feel like you need? You need to keep playing more matches?
M	Not that long ago you were potentially being a top10 player. Now you're talking about being 50, 60 by the end of the year. Tough year with injuries. Has this year been a lesson in learning to be patient?
M	Has it been humbling in that regard?
M	Any concern today that the injury, the niggle that you're carrying, is going to delay any plans for the next tournament?
M	Were you over the illness that caused you to withdraw from the grass court tournaments before Wimbledon?
M	How long for?
M	Did you have much grass court practice at all?
M	And for yourself, how do you feel?
M	What were your expectations for the tournament?
M	The first match you've won here in a couple of years. Were you pleased with how things went out there?
M	It's been a while since you've won a match here.
M	In the first set, I think 42 up, you made a doublefault, you touched your back. How are you physically?
M	You're seen as something of a thrill seeker given your love of skydiving. How does skydiving compare with featuring at Wimbledon?
M	Which is better?
M	Is the enjoyment the same?
M	Over the years what is the biggest difficulty coming into Wimbledon? What is it about the tournament, the surface perhaps, that you found difficult to adapt to?
M	What has been the biggest challenge for you after your long climb to get where you are now and winning a Grand Slam in Australia in terms of believing that's where you belong and it wasn't just a run?
M	How far are you looking ahead? You're seeded here 5. Do you look ahead and think what sort of run you might have to a potential final?
M	Over the last nine years only you and del Potro have broken through to win a major other than the big four. What is your sense of how the big four has ruled all these years and how long that will last?
M	Regarding the early loss you had in Paris, do you feel less pressure coming here or more pressure?
M	What are your thoughts about the World Cup? What have you enjoyed the most or been troubled by the most?
M	What is your prediction on the Switzerland match tomorrow?
M	After the French, what did you do? Did you switch off for a while? Did you go back to Switzerland and forget about tennis?
F	So this was an opponent who has beaten you a couple times. What was your mindset going in to the match?
F	So what have you been doing since Saturday?
F	Physically at the end of Eastbourne were you feeling okay or feeling the effects of a tournament?
F	Is there a difference now knowing that, not that you did not know you could win a tournament, but just having been there, is there a whole different level of confidence?
F	Are the courts here different than how they felt in Eastbourne? When you started hitting yesterday, did it feel weird?
F	Just in time.
F	Are you getting a lot of congratulations and stuff from people? Are people generally happy for you?
F	Does your preparation or what you're doing here at Wimbledon this time around, is it different than playing slams before or even compared to Wimbledons in the past? Do you feel like the experience of playing slams and enough tournaments and now winning a tournament that it's changed how you're kind of playing your way through this?
F	Is there a specific goal that you have kind of either the rest of year or just this tournament now that you've kind of established this high standard for yourself?
F	Winning a title can feel like getting a monkey of the back or it's a milestone you can finally check off. Are there other milestones that are like that, Oh, I want to get my first blah, blah, blah win?
F	Please do that. There wasn't a radar clock on court today, so we didn't know how fast you served. You were really serving hard in Eastbourne. Did you feel like it was up there?
F	You're obviously a great hope for the future of U.S. tennis. Did you feel under pressure in that way?
F	Have you ever practiced with Taylor or hit with her at all? How well do you know her?
F	Yeah. So you're pretty familiar with each other's games. Potentially could play in the next round.
F	What are your thoughts on that?
F	D.C. and Chicago.
F	Yeah.
F	She's on right now.
F	What is it about her ball that makes it so difficult? We've seen so many players when they first hit with Taylor they can't read the ball. Is it just the lefty spin, or is there something else going on?
F	Who is the coach?
F	Do you talk to her about kind of just the whole lifestyle and the expectations? Do you guys have those kind of talks ever?
F	Is it weird then like if you're so focused and you're playing matches, tournaments, and going from city to city, whatever, and then you come into these press conferences and you get these questions and you're like, Why do they care about this? I didn't realize they were paying attention to that?
F	When you do win, though, how intoxicating is that?
F	Can you remember how many tournaments, juniors and seniors, that you finished without losing a match? In other words, how many have you won, how many weeks you've had?
M	Was all his recent grass court experiences he's had, was that a big factor, the fact he's had a lot of success recently on grass?
M	Is it frustrating given how well you did last year? Would it have been nice to build on what you did here last year?
M	How do you feel today went?
M	At this stage for you, is that as important as anything else, having the experience?
M	How important is the wild card situation to a player such as yourself, to be able to get the opportunity to play on this stage? Obviously the flipside of it is people are going to look at it as how the Brits have got on today and they're going to question it.
M	Do you need that opportunity to be able to have an opportunity of taking the next steps, going further up the ladder?
M	What would you say to people who say the wildcard system makes it too easy for British players? 'Pampered' is the word that's been used before.
M	Effectively you have to have an opportunity because without opportunity you won't get better. It's 52 weeks of the year, a full season of entries into competitions without having to work for it?
