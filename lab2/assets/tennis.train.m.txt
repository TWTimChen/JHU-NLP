what was it like out there, kevin?
that was pretty high quality. have many people played that well against you on a grass court?
what do you take away from this?
if andy can maintain that level of tennis, how do you see his wimbledon chances?
his performance compared to when you played him at wimbledon last year?
is his level higher than last year?
how does his serve compare on grass compared to other surfaces? is it more effective on grass?
looking at the stats, 73% first serves in, which i imagine you'd be pretty happy with, and yet you come out with a result like that. is it just his ability to read serves?
when you go into a match against andy, do you feel unsettled kind of from the start that his weapon is sort of counteracting yours?
you were just talking about taking positives away from here, and i appreciate it's two entirely different levels of event, but between now and wimbledon starting, if you had to be working on aspects, what would they be?
you mentioned today that your preparation coming into this tournament had been really good. you had been back to florida and trained on the grass. i'm interested to know from the point of view of the surface of grass, how different is it to play on grass with temperatures like that and coming to europe and it's been chilly? does it make a difference?
i just wondered if you felt it. you talked yesterday about how you feel the serve and...
you were saying courtside you haven't done anything different to your serve, but do you have levels where you're more intense on it than others? does it vary during the course of a match or from one tournament to another?
i think after the last match gilles was saying against raonic he couldn't get a racquet on his serve. he had a bit of guesswork but eventually sort of managed to turn the tide. you didn't really give him a chance to do that today, did you?
if you've got someone who is so good at that element on the other side, then do you have to be careful not to try almost and become bluff/double bluff and almost try and move away from what you know will work for you?
what difference do the conditions make to your serve in particular on grass, more overcast today compared to when it's been warmer and sunnier other days?
it's 30 years since kevin curren got to the wimbledon final. how much of an inspiration was he when you were growing up? how much did you know him?
in terms of his influence on south african tennis...
how big of a match is tomorrow for you just in terms of your career, a 500 final?
if it is andy murray, how difficult is it going to be to beat him? he's in pretty good form.
if it is viktor, because it could very well be tomorrow, what are your thoughts on playing him?
what do you remember about that match with andy last year at wimbledon?
the skies out there don't look great at the moment. if the worse happens and it couldn't be completed today, would that have any bearing on the final? give you any kind of edge?
with the weather forecast as it was today, did anyone mention to you the possibility that the two semis would be played on different courts?
a few of the guys this week on grass have seemed to have been picking up some injuries. you mentioned fitness. how are you feeling at the moment? how are you bearing up?
where did you train on grass in florida?
how did that come about?
jack didn't ask to have a hit with you or anything?
obviously he's someone who was pretty much a trailblazer in his sport. people who have that winning mentality, can that be something that can be transferable across sports?
(question about serving and having a hit with jack.)
what's your favorite jack nicholson film?
or jack nicklaus.
big serving has been sort of the theme for the week. how did it feel to be able to cope with what he was throwing down and come through?
do you think you were reading his serve better or...
do you have to gamble a bit then?
so you may have to do the same thing again in the next match, do you think?
is the return of serve something you work on in training?
do you always look at the scoreboard and see what your stats were and adjust based on it or consider it?
in the first set, did you think...
on a slower surface where you have more time to react, do you have a tactic in mind before the ball is served or is it pure instinct?
in that last game, switching to when you were serving, you had two deuce points in a row where you served the first serve, it went to his forehand. both times he hit it into the net. do you remember that?
did the serve do what you wanted it to do, or was he just surprised or hit a bad shot?
how will it be against kevin anderson in the next match? again, another big server. same kind of thing? same challenge again?
(question about being france's no.1.)
how disappointing is that loss for you?
when you're facing match points on his serve, do you have a tactic or is it more instinct? like what's going through your mind?
obviously serving is one of your strengths. return of serve, is it something you work on in practice or is it something you kind of spend time and you're needing to improve?
how do you sum up this week for you, and how is your body feeling, especially your foot?
there has been a debate this week about the dominance of the big servers at this tournament, and i'm just wondering, who do you see as the best server in the world?
why?
going on to wimbledon, you say this week has exceeded your expectations. do you have any expectations for wimbledon?
is it something specific you have been doing on the mental side?
is that with coaches or with somebody...
how much if at all do you feel this extra week, a week of grass court tennis, will change the script at wimbledon? will the big servers or guys who are maybe more comfortable on grass, will they be able to feel their way more into wimbledon because they have had more time to adjust?
who do you feel has the best shot for this title?
is that a gut reaction?
is it hard to play someone who takes their time between points when you're the returner and you want to sort of feel your way through the game?
no, not today. in general, i mean.
would you be for a shot clock actually on court?
how did you turn that around from a set down?
troicki next. you have an excellent record against him. stuttgart final last week. what are your thoughts?
how much do you think the success of the big serve this week has been down to the specific conditions of the courts here this week?
you saw jose after the game. (indiscernible.)
your left thigh?
would you consider your habits and not putting the ball in your pocket?
jose, i know various sportsmen you like picking their brain about the psychology of sport. is he somebody you have been able to chat with him about that?
(question about arsenal.)
in the past we spoke about troicki. you described as unprofessional as what happened with his drug test. do you feel it was right his ban was cut back from 18 to 12? do you think tennis itself has moved out of that time? do you think people are getting more professional and the testing process is getting better, as well?
you don't have any problem with him or cilic being on the tour?
(question about stan wawrinka.)
to what extent did today's friendly crowd benefit your motivation?
the friendly crowd of today, to what extent did it, let's say, improve your motivation?
you actually enjoyed the "andy"?
both of you served really well today. was it just, in the end, the consistency of your serving?
there has been quite a buzz the last few days about the number of aces the players are serving here, but also, i gather karlovic has just set a new record in halle, as well. what do you put that down to? is it the condition of the grass this year or are the players just getting their technique that much better?
how do you cope with a situation where, as you were saying, you weren't getting a look in on his serve for quite a few of the service games. how do you counteract that? what do you say to yourself?
do you feel you're playing your best tennis?
if it happens to be milos in the semis, that would be similar to what happened today?
would you rate what you have done so far as an achievement? and obviously winning would be the best you could do, but do you feel you have a real chance?
a lot of the players have been saying how difficult it is to transition from clay to grass, and particularly the tall guys because of the amount of bending and how low you have to get. how do you find the transition? most of your success has come on hard courts rather than grass, but looking at your game, you should be doing just as well on grass.
you said milos has one of the best serves in the world. who would you say has the best serve in the world at the moment overall?
as a spectator, would you rather watch a guy with big aces or a match with lots of rallies?
there's something intriguing in the pressure that builds. if you know the other guy is serving well...
if this is the best performance in this tournament, how does it feel?
those players you have nominated on the best serve, if you really had to pinpoint picking one person, who would it be? include yourself.
gilles was talking about how he knows you back in the barcelona days. tell us a little bit more about how good friends you are and how you get to know him even better now that he's being coached by jamie.
i think you hit a little bit with jamie in the spring when your coaching situation was kind of still being decided upon. is he somebody who you can imagine maybe working with at some point in your career?
another guy you have respect for, ian hughes, he's doing a pretty good job by the looks of things with svitolina. do you think it's a bit of a shame, jamie having done well, that they are kind of not working in the british system, so to speak?
when you're playing against someone you know and like gilles, does that bring a different dynamic on the court, or when you're out there do you totally block that out?
in terms of your own coaching situation, you have jonas back with you this week. is that working as seamlessly as you hoped it would?
you had a wrist injury a few years ago. you know what it's like to come back from that. what do you think it will be like for laura coming back after such a long absence?
two questions, if you don't mind. one, it's been quite a time for you to come in here for press. are you okay? is there any injury issue at all?
secondly, there is a bit of a patent developing here with the real big servers making their mark. gilles hit i think 37 aces. raonic is blasting them. isner and feliciano are knocking each other into oblivion out there at the moment. a few years ago, there was a couple of tournaments here where there was the likes of greg and goran and stich and people like that. people were saying it ceases to become that much of entertainment when it's just ace, ace, ace, ace. is the court playing faster this year? have you noticed it faster? what are your thoughts on the ace wars?
if you could have a shot from any other player on the tour, what would it be and why? like a serve, backhand?
could you just sum up your performance today?
some coaches, when they sit beside the court, are very intense, kind of lots of pumping of the fist. i haven't really watched jonas until today. i thought he looked quite relaxed and nonchalant. do you have a view on what you can expect from your coaches' body language when you look to the side of the court like that?
fantastic win. what influence has jamie delgado, your coach, had on your terrific performances over the last year or two?
how does it feel to reach the third round here for the first time? and how do you feel about your prospective opponent?
did you feel grigor was a little flat today?
32 years old, and...
i beg your pardon. playing perhaps some of the best tennis of your career careerhigh ranking. what do you put that down to? obviously the opponent in the next round could end up being andy murray. would the influence of jamie be of any help in that? would he be able to have any special tactics for someone it's obviously a guy he will know well.
if you knew him a bit when you were young and you're sort of getting to know him again now, how impressed are you with what he's done and what he's achieved in his career so far?
just on your injury, what was nature of the injury? you were saying you, just by nature of being out for a while, your ranking dipped. but you have worked hard in the comeback. you must be relieved and delighted to be able to do that?
just wondering, obviously you know how everyone gets behind andy when it comes to the summer over here, how big it is in terms of queen's and wimbledon. what does it mean to people back home when you, in your home country, when you get to quarterfinals of a tournament like this?
maybe if you win the tournament?
if you beat andy murray, surely you would get some headlines and become a proper sporting legend in your home country?
you practiced with andy murray this morning. do you think that benefits you for your match against grigor? did it have a positive effect, you think?
did you talk with him about your current match with dimitrov? did he give you any points or anything?
how would you assess your game on grass today?
does it hurt more losing as a defending champion?
what will you be doing between now and wimbledon?
a lot of the big guys struggled here. how do you explain that?
how would you compare your loss today with the french open firstround loss? would you say you're more disappointed?
easy third set in contrast to the first two. what made the difference?
how comfortable do you feel coming back? grass is a tricky surface. even though you have been playing consistently, do you feel safe and stable? does the foot feel different?
did it take time to get that confidence back, going for wide balls and stretch yourself completely?
speaking of discomfort, how frequent is it?
is that on your mind when you're playing?
considering you have been out for some time, how do you assess your couple of matches this week on grass?
i guess when you arrive here you want to get a good couple of wins under your belt. now that you have done that, do you now start to think possibly i might be in line for the title, or is that a bit too...
talk about your discomfort related to your injury.
what was the name of the problem?
do you need any adaptation to the shoe or anything?
you started that match on fire. what went wrong?
how did you feel physically? is the fatigue starting to catch up with you a bit?
how are you finding the grass?
where will you be playing next week?
was the fourth game in the second set really the clutcher when you had the break point, a really long game, held, and he broke you in the next game?
hence the tweet?
playing on centre court versus court 1, do you feel any different?
how big a difference would it be for you now going straight into the grand slams?
how is your grandmother? will her health have any bearing on your playing?
between now and the start of the championships, what do you feel you have to work on the most? obviously you said your forehand let you down today, but overall, as you prepare, what's going to be the focus?
you're still in doubles, yes?
how does that help you?
(question about his serve.)
are you taking any interest in the rugby?
(question about jeremy clarkson.)
yeah.
surely you're not a one direction fan?
so 22 aces, kevin. pretty good?
you have a good record against him, don't you? you won the last three against him?
that's what i meant, yeah.
what does it feel like to be the first guy to beat a new grand slam champion?
obviously your focus is still very much on this tournament, but rolling forward to wimbledon, you will be one of the guys that people are going to say you've got a fair chance of going actually really deep there. what do you think about your chances as you see them?
the draw has really opened up now. do you think you have a chance of winning it?
what makes it so hard against wawrinka?
(question about the last four matches with stan.)
stan said after the french he effectively said don't lump me in the top 4, i'm not near them. i guess you could understand why he might say that, but do you think there is still that gap?
just as an aside, talking about players changing nationality, what's the situation with your citizenship now?
this year?
this transformation was good from clay to grass. that wasn't bad, wasn't it?
you will have to go and book an extra practice session after your 49minute match.
besides you playing well today, did you notice that nick wasn't feeling well or looking well, anything like that out on the court?
he said he's sick. i was just wondering if you noticed anything at all?
is he quite a strange opponent in some ways? because he can miss for a while and suddenly he gets hot and you're not quite sure what to expect?
how good was it to get a match like that against somebody like nick when you're going in against somebody similar with a big serve like kevin anderson?
what do you find physically the most difficult switching from clay to grass? i understand it can be quite painful for certain body parts.
what about the shorts, stan? you brought the shorts with you. are they sort of your lucky charm now?
nick was saying he sounded completely fed up and said when he leaves here he will switch off the tennis channels and not watch any tennis, switch off the app on his phone. do you have any sympathy with a guy when he says he's a bit fed up?
he said after this tournament he doesn't want to think about tennis for the week, two weeks. does that surprise you?
do you think he's kidding us?
what time of the year did you decide to play here rather than halle? when did you make that decision?
will you stay in the same place for the whole month?
how different do you feel after winning paris compared to 18 months ago with australia and that experience? how important is that going to be for you now? i think you even said after australia it was difficult, something new, getting to understand the attention, the focus and the pressure. so talk about that difference and how you're going to adapt to it this time.
how much is that a blow for you in the general picture?
how different was the grass here to the grass you were playing on in stuttgart?
physically and mentally do you feel okay?
and physically?
would you have preferred more matches before wimbledon?
is your grass court preparation okay going into wimbledon?
what's it like when you're under pressure in a match and you know the former king of spain is sitting there watching you and jose mourinho and other people in crowd watching you? is that inspiration or what?
you're still in the doubles. who's to say you won't be here playing the doubles final on sunday. is your intention to, as soon as you possibly can, to go back to mallorca or stay in london and practice on the grass?
when you slipped over and you got up, you were feeling your left knee. were you worried at that stage?
would jose mourinho be someone who would ever give you advice? if so, what would he say?
obviously it can transfer though.
playing on grass is unpredictable, always different, but when you're playing somebody like alex on grass and he's such an awkward player, can you just comment on that, on how much more difficult it might be to play somebody like him on grass?
how does it feel to be back on grass?
new shoes?
how long have they been in the making?
i guess usually here your sort of sole focus is 100% wimbledon, probably still is. i'm just wondering if you're looking at more of a threeweek package here with obviously the big davis cup match here afterwards?
jos mourinho, did you have a chance to speak to him at all?
could we ask how vocal you were in the discussions about actually playing the davis cup quarterfinal here?
yes.
do you have a view on the policy on wimbledon wildcards? wimbledon is announcing its first batch of wildcards today and the lta have scrapped their previous recommendation that players need to be ranked in the world's top 250. british players have a wildcard. instead they want to look at each one on a playerbyplayer basis. i wondered if you have a view on that policy.
looking ahead towards atp finals, what's your opinion for it to stay in london, and how long do you think it should stay there for?
do you ever get bored?
putting your coaching hat on, give us a verdict on verdasco and the danger he poses.
it was over quite quickly. were you able to settle into this match, do you feel?
is it partly because you haven't been able to practice fully because of the injury after paris?
you seemed to be coughing quite a lot out there. are you actually not feeling very well?
how was it to just push through in that sort of situation? do you feel you kind of just got to go through, whatever?
looking ahead to wimbledon, that was your big breakout last year. you say you're not feeling too well at the moment, but are you looking forward to going to wimbledon?
even going with a couple of losses, you know you can go into the big stage? you can still...
when did it all come on?
a lot of people had it coming out of paris. andy said he got back from paris and a lot of people were sick there. was it something in the locker room?
what will you do now? just practicing? will you try to get some games somewhere?
like you said, you don't feel like you need to have lots of time on court to be able to perform at a grand slam. you said you don't feel like you necessarily have to have lots of form and momentum to go and perform at a grand slam. can you sort of cling to that, at least?
will you play a tournament at all next week?
do you actually have a base in london, a place here, or do you just rent one?
you were just saying you really didn't want to be out there. is it more just to do with not feeling well and sounds like the flu or whatever, or is it a bigger picture?
is it a question of i mean, you make no secret of the fact you miss your family. you have been on the road for a long time. is it something to do with that?
(question about buying a scooter.)
to get over this kind of you're switching off tennis, but are you looking at bringing over some of your family and doing something different?
as a wildcard, is it a bit of a surprise for you to be in the draw? but what was your attitude going into today's game?
when did you find out you were playing in singles? was it when you were en route to australia?
can i ask how your grandma is?
how do you feel with the dash back home and rush and comeback? are you feeling a little tired, jet lagged?
was it nice to get back home? obviously sounds like it meant quite a lot to you to be able to get back home?
you're on the centre court tomorrow. is that the first time you have played on a centre court in a major tournament?
when was the last time?
today's match, up 3love, got back into it, he won that first set, and then you pretty much took over after that. comment on how you felt things went today and how you played.
you mentioned the doubles. what's it like to be able to play doubles tennis with one of australia's greatest?
a lot of us don't know very much about you. can you just tell us what your interests are outside of tennis, you know, football teams you support?
have you got anyone traveling with you at the moment, your family or friends?
any thoughts on playing gilles?
what was different today to what happened yesterday?
psychologically, how important was that win?
what's it like coming in as defending champion?
would you still feel like you owned the court if you stepped on it in the quarterfinal against andy murray? if so, wouldn't you like to?
is there something extra special about playing the home favorite in their backyard?
just in terms of, like you said, enjoying it more even though being the defending champion, is there an element of being pleased to win the first round when you come back as defending champion?
given how well you played on grass last year, do you think wimbledon represents your best chance at a major?
stan won the french juniors and went on to win.
you said you were disappointed in the way you played in paris, but what do you think of jack sock and his potential? how do you see him as a player?
is there something about the french open you haven't quite figured out?
maybe you need to bottle the pressureless feeling you have here and take it to paris.
as disappointing as it would have been to lose that match, how special was it to be recognized and have the opportunity to say thank you?
that forehand on match point?
will this be an emotional, long farewell for you this year? will you just put that aside and get on with your tennis?
obviously the australian open will mean a lot to you, but in terms of the other tournaments over the year, is this the part of the season that, given it's your farewell tour this year, this means a lot to you given your success and the attachment you have to grass over the years?
and what's your hope there? are you quite desperate to get maybe one last win there in terms of a match or two under your belt and see what it looks like?
you had quite a good year last year, and your ranking, you ended like no.50. what was it that actually triggered the decision in australia this year? something happened, or did you also know that this was going to be it this year?
assuming that competing is still the thing that drives you, is the travel the biggest grind for you now?
winning wimbledon as young as you did, did you think you'd potentially win more than has happened in the end?
are you playing in any tournaments next week?
have you prepared for your retirement? what have you been doing in that respect? in terms of helping young australians come through, what are your plans involved with those?
we know you're playing the australian open and obviously wimbledon next week. have you made a decision on the us open and maybe the davis cup later in the year, as well?
when you look across the way the tour has changed in the many years you have been playing, what are those changes that surprise you most or you think are most significant?
congrats on winning a big title again. how happy are you?
it took you a long time to win your first title, first part of your career. now you come back, and i think this one is even more important.
how nervous were you? how much did nerves come into your...
as you said, you're playing already on monday. don't you think that even though it's always like that, players who play the final the week before slam should get an extra day off?
is there anyone you want to kind of give, in a way, this title to?
if you end up making it back or making it to the top 10 or even better, is it possible that you would look back at the ban as even a positive thing?
on a different note, i have one question for you: i've been watching you in brescia in a challenger and now here all week, and i still can't figure out, is your forehand better than the backhand or the other way around?
how important is just physical fitness for you right now? you seem to be moving really well and there were a lot of points that displayed that tonight. it was very entertaining tennis. how important is it for you to be able to keep that up?
surely not the final you wanted, but is there anything positive you take from this one?
what kind of strategy did you bring into the match?
you came in with your thigh being strapped up and then you asked for the trainer to come in. what's the problem with it?
how confident are you that you'll recover before the australian open on monday?
do you think that since you played today in sydney they should have let you play on tuesday?
congrats for the win. great start again today. do you feel like you're getting into the matches on a good rhythm better and better?
do you know you're anyway in history because first time two qualifiers will face each other in an atp final.
how do you compare the way you played this week to 2011 i think it was when you made the final here?
you outserved the guy who has been serving all the aces in this tournament today.
i think he had 52 in three games coming into tonight's match?
yes.
there were many serbian fans today. is it good to feel the crowd supporting you so much.
obviously the focus is on tomorrow's final, but did you have a chance to watch the draw?
do you have any specific memories of playing mikhail kukushkin before? anything stand out?
bad luck on the loss today. how much of a factor was the heat today?
so can you talk a little bit more about what was difficult for you today out there?
on the other hand, this time last year you were in a completely different position in terms of your ranking.
even though you lost today, next week you're going to end up with your careerhigh ranking, i think. i'm not sure.
yeah. so can you talk a little bit about the journey back from outside the top 300 a year ago?
why did you decide you were going to do it again, come back?
you're one of a bunch of players reaching their career high at sort of 30, 31, 32. do you think it's because of fitness and because you had the time off and you were able to improve?
as you said, you had a great year in the challengers. do you find a big difference between the level of competition there and the atp tour?
do you think that consistency is because they're just not at that level or because things are tougher and the challengers are so good and you don't have a coach and physio maybe?
how do you think victor is playing right now as another player who has come back from a break?
what are you looking for in the season?
yeah.
congrats. really tough out there, wasn't it?
matches through qualifying in both brisbane and here and the rounds here, was that the highest level match you played, that quarterfinal tonight?
what is your mindset these days with tennis? just seems like the last six months or so have been a real whirlwind for you obviously from the ban and then to come back from a very low ranking and now shooting up into the top 100 again. doing really well.
does it make your ambition greater now? you did very well before. got to no.12 in the world. are you aiming for the top 10 now?
you were sort of punished for something you didn't deliberately try to do. did you ever think, you know what, i'm just going to walk away because i was treated unjustly?
did you lose any sponsors over it?
did you feel you had to always defend yourself? did you feel embarrassed?
what kind of conversations did you have with novak about it?
you played quite a few tough matches, yesterday and one today. do you think that you may be running a little bit out of gas before the australian open?
yeah.
that was a really close one. what do you feel like made the difference in the end?
must be pleased with how you served as well.
on the face of it obviously from the results this hasn't been as good a tournament as the last two years, but it probably is your better tennis than you've been playing, do you think?
is there a positive getting to melbourne on friday instead of just before like you have in years past?
the fitness showed through tonight. talk about the stuff you did in the preseason, the extra work you were doing.
just on a different note, have you ever thought about joining twitter? is there a reason you're not on twitter? a lot of people would want to see you on twitter.
players enjoy interacting with their supporters on social media.
do you think you'd get yourself into trouble?
after last year at the open in melbourne when you had to retire the first round against rafa, how important is it to get past a first round and maybe a second and third?
tomorrow morning. ten past ten.
going to get a couple lefties to hit up with on the back courts?
the injury you had last year, did that give you a sense of urgency that once you got fit you really needed to make a move? because you were on a bit of a plateau before in terms of making your way through the ranks. has that given you a bit of urgency to get it right, get fit, do all the right things, and really start to push ahead?
first few sessions when you came back from surgery, what was it like?
what are you listening to on your headphones?
you've played now six matches in a row and won them. must be feeling pretty good.
admittedly, del potro is low in the rankings, but he's a former grand slam champion and top player.
he said you played very smart tennis. what was your game plan? obviously going to his backhand a lot. what else did you want to do?
was it a challenge to keep your composure during the last tiebreaker?
tough loss today, but how did you feel about the week?
do you see this tournament as a good opportunity to get your first tournament win?
you are one of the few players that has a top ranking in both singles and doubles. do you find that easy to balance, or do you feel like it takes away from one or the other?
you're 33 now, but you're also playing the best tennis of your life really. you reached a new high ranking. i'm wondering what's driving you to keep getting better and better?
with like all the finals that you've played in tournaments and had some rough losses at that stage, what are some of the things you've learned from that? what are some of the philosophies and perspectives you've learned from being in that position so many times?
what was it like for you and the other french guys attempting to bounce back after the davis cup final and get motivated again, prepare in the offseason?
that seemed pretty quick and decisive. feel that way on court?
can you be more specific about the things you changed? you said you went out and practiced a few things. the way you approach a point or was it...
he's obviously a lefthander and a big serve. does that present different problems?
you mentioned a few times now the need to start stronger and quick. is that something you didn't do in the past so well or...
five seeds fell out today. the draw is really opening up. does that excite you or stimulate you?
you take more motivation knowing you're the only aussie standing?
do you think people are starting to talk about you again? last four months has been all about nick. do you feel it's starting to come back on you?
you reached the final here last year, but do you feel you're playing better now than 12 months ago?
your shot selection generally is something that's worked really well for you and confused a lot of your opponents. is that something that you think about consciously, or is it something that comes naturally?
you seem to have also added a little extra dimension of aggression in your game. you've always been famous for the placement and spins. in the last few weeks, improving forehand winners and moving really well. that something that's come naturally to add to your game as well, going after the shots more?
you mean that you're trying to shorten the matches by hitting more aces and winners?
one more thing. your hips tonight, were they feeling good? were you 100%?
very complete performance. must have felt terrific.
(regarding fitness work and when it started; what was worked on.)
is fitness kind of more important to you now than when you first started on tour? are you surprised how much it plays a role?
is this the fittest you've been going into an aussie open?
there is another open draw here this year. feel like it's another opportunity to go to the final?
wimbledon must be a big goal, to get a seeding there as high as possible.
guys like kyrgios and thanasi coming through give you more hunger?
sharing the spotlight in sydney, how does that suit you? last couple years it's been all about you. you said you enjoyed that.
playing kohlschreiber next. talk about that match.
given this was the fittest that you felt, what would be the minimum expectation of yourself in 2015?
obviously come back in the second set. what do you think sparked that? i guess what do you think allowed him to pull away at the end?
did your behindtheback return loosen you up? you seemed to play much better almost immediately after that.
do you think this unbelievable game when you broke back for two games all, do you think it took too much energy out of you mentally or physically?
there is nothing neutral about the crowds when you're playing. a lot of athletes always say they are not paying attention to what's around them. are you aware of how much the crowd was pulling for you in that second set when you made your run?
why did you go flat? what happened?
just looking at the last two finals that you have played  and both have been extraordinary matches; obviously a disappointment for yourself  but can you compare the disappointment this year to last year? which one was a bit more disappointing or less so?
how would you describe the current challenge of trying to solve novak when he's playing kind of his peak level?
we talk about the end of the match, but what are your thoughts about the start of the match? did you feel like maybe you started a bit slower than him, or was it anything else?
talk about how the second set got away from you with the double faults in the tiebreak and how you managed to pull yourself together and get into the third and run away with it.
as you have lost the past two matches against him, was it even more special to win this one?
one thing that jelena jankovic said earlier when she was serving for the match in the second set in her match is that the pressure was so great. she had so many nerves she couldn't lift her arm. how do you deal with that pressure? you had to deal as well in turning the match around, had the match then had to deal with it in the second set and turned it back around. can you just explain a little bit what you go through when you're trying to get to the finish line?
roger's no.2 behind you in the ranking, but do you consider him today as clearly the most dangerous guy for you, the guy you like the least to face?
what does a title like this mean to you when you look at the record and the stats: a milestone 50th career, record equalling fourth, first man since federer in nine years to win this back to back years. what do those figures mean to you?
do you think you get enough credit for your achievements, given the bar that's raised by roger and rafa with, you know, the 14 grand slams and 17? you have 8. do you think you get enough credit?
along those lines, watching the match and also following it on social media, one of the things that kept coming through on my feed was how many of your fans felt that the crowd was rooting for roger. when you hear so much of that, does it unnerve you at all? are you thinking they just want a third set? more tennis? what goes through your mind when that's happening?
the television cameras caught you after the tiebreaker taking a sip of water and your hand was shaking a little bit. i was wondering if you were aware that that was happening, and if so, what it was?
so was it like panic or anger or has that happened before?
my question was similar. once you got broken in the third set, spiked the ball and breaking the racquet eventually, does that help you clear your mind? you don't do it really very often.
on the flip side of that, what are the feelings that you had when roger doublefaulted to lose serve?
would you say you're in the absolute prime of your career? also, how much do you think you can still improve?
you mentioned, you know, the emotional roller coaster you go through. with a match like this, is it tougher mentally or tougher physically?
kind of tough playing roger. seemed like a small stretch for you that won the match for him.
any regret you have on the first set, or do you think you were playing the best you could today?
was it difficult to come back on court after the day you had yesterday against nadal or mentally you were fresh?
do you get a better sense where your game is compared to those top guys after playing and beating rafa for the first time and playing the way you did today against federer?
how tricky is roger's backhand? like today when he is slicing a lot, does that make it difficult for you to play against him?
was part of the game plan you felt you didn't execute as well as you wanted to?
can you give this indian wells/miami portion of the season some perspective? real meat of your season comes up with the clay and grass season. what are the positives and negatives of going deep? the weather is grueling and the tennis is obviously at a top level.
who do you think will win tomorrow?
was it just one of those days where nothing you tried worked?
is there any reason why you weren't able to come out of the blocks quickly? was it just novak or were you feeling sluggish or...
is it tougher to serve against him knowing how good of a returner he is? extra thoughts in your mind while you're going through your serving?
you and nole practically grew up together on the tour and been friends for a long time. is there anything that still surprises you about him, his leadership or his game?
how frustrating was it in the match an effort to try and stay with him and things aren't just working out?
you talked about things you need to do better against the top guys in terms of serve and everything else. do you still feel there is a gap there? you've gotten up to no.4 in the rankings. you haven't had a win in the last year of the three guys ahead of you.
is this a match you want to forget altogether right away, or do you think there are some things to take out of it?
this is your first masters semifinal in a while. when you were with lendl you reached only three masters semifinals. did you feel you had to almost kind of sacrifice these events and focus on slams?
have you decided anything about the scheduling for amlie and jonas coming up in terms of who will do what?
have you been watching him?
do you feel based on the last week you're playing some of your very best tennis at the right time?
do you think it's frustrating for these young players that you guys aren't going away any time soon? (laughter.)
last year you had a great final against novak. can you talk about playing against him again?
yeah, last year. and then also, you have the most titles here at this tournament. if novak wins he will tie you. do those numbers here mean anything to you?
just wanted to ask about the final you two were supposed to play in london last year. you pulled out. serena had to pull out of her match last night, as well. wondering how you go about revealing that and announcing it, how delicate was the situation, and what you wanted to convey to the crowd at that moment?
how much do you remember about last year's final over here against novak? would you look back on any sort of video footage to remind you what happened in that as you look ahead to tomorrow?
you're obviously here to handle your own business, but when you play someone like novak 38 times, do you enjoy these legendary competitions, best of the best, or do you go in and say, i want to win a championship no matter what?
since last year's final you have done pretty well against djokovic, and dubai final was only like three weeks ago. how's your confidence level for the final?
considering the winning wave you're on and the form you have at the moment, do you ever tell yourself, hmm, maybe i should play miami after all?
what would you say is the biggest key tomorrow? your serve? maybe the way you move?
you have a lot of great rivalries. can you characterize your rivalry with novak compared to your other rivalry, like rafa and the older ones like marat and some of the other guys? how would you describe this rivalry? how would you distinguish it from the others?
closer to getting on par with the rafa rivalry?
i guess before the match you were guessing it wouldn't be so quick or so smooth against andy?
andy hasn't beaten you since the wimbledon final in 2013. when you go in to play him now, do you just feel totally confident?
do you see the diminished play from his end since he came back from the injury early last year? since then he's basically 0 and 11 against you, rafa, and roger.
a couple days ago, roger had said that every great player has their sort of phase during this era, and right now it's yours. you're pretty much the favorite going into every tournament. defending your championship here, just how comfortable are you with how you're playing and where your level is right now personally?
we haven't seen you in full press since wayne odesnik was banned a couple days ago. i think you guys practiced before the miami final last year. wondered what your view is on that news.
do you like always night tennis or is it disruptive to rhythm?
the last person to repeat as a champion here was roger back in 2006. if you win tomorrow you'll match him for the most titles at indian wells. do those kind of numbers and landmarks mean anything to you in these tournaments? also, can you talk about playing either roger or milos?
last year's final. some thought this was probably one of the best men's final in this stadium in 15 years.
for almost two sets maybe you played your best tennis in one week. then you looked like tired because something that what happened or maybe something else.
no, for the first two sets.
at the end of the match.
what are the greatest regrets on this match? what are the things you think you could have done differently?
you had talked the other day about the challenge of facing these big, big servers. can you talk about the mental challenge of having to face a guy for three sets who is serving 140 miles an hour?
you spoke the other day about the conditions. how was it today to manage the shape of your shots and the thin air and the court speed? how was that for you today?
you said obviously you're disappointed at losing, but was it also a frustrating match to play?
you played well; you played well the whole tournament. can you talk a little bit about milos' level? can you talk about his level to beat you? how good is his level? is he ready to make that step where he can compete with you and the other three big players consistently?
what are your thoughts about milos playing tomorrow against roger?
when you go into a tiebreaker with someone with a serve so big, do you ever doubt yourself at the start of the tiebreak?
doubts.
this guy has wrecked an olympics for you; he's wrecked one wimbledon; he's wrecked one us open. does that run through your mind before you go out on the court and play tomas berdych?
playing rafa again possibly. last time you played him here in 2013 when the back issues started up. could you go back to that match and your decision to play through that pain and everything that went on.
how do you feel now going into possibly another third match in four years against him here?
tomas said that you did pretty much everything perfect today. did you feel it was something like that?
is there extra satisfaction with bageling an opponent like tomas, or is it just another win?
in other sports they talk about when they have a great rival it brings out the best. can you talk about the rivalry with you and rafa and what it does for you and maybe how it helped or enhanced your legacy?
your legacy.
if having a rival like rafa helped and enhanced your legacy?
do you think all these rivals, not just him, but novak and andy, has helped you maintain such a high level at 33?
going back to your 2013 injury, last year when you came back here you said that you pulled the back and that you had to change the way you trained yourself. you changed repetitions, drills, so on, so forth. and because of the changes of trial and error situation it took a long time for you to figure out how to train yourself. one year later you look in pretty good shape. do you feel you've found a training regime that can carry you through the next three, five or so years?
many good players are struggling with adjusting to the condition of indian wells. somebody says ball flies really fast; somebody says ball bounces really high or balls are not good enough. you have been steady playing good here. what is the key for you to play this good in indian wells?
the other day you were talking about longevity. in one sense, are you surprised that you're still playing? just as a second part to what you were saying about training, picking up training after this, where will you train?
it was more like if you were surprised that you were still playing at this stage.
did it get to the point out there where you kind of said to yourself, this guy is just unbeatable today; he's just too good?
why do you feel that you're putting a lot of pressure on yourself? you had a great year; made grade strides this year. what was it about today?
you have had success against him before. what do you feel like you did do then that you may not have done today? what made a difference today?
was there something that he's doing? a lot of times it ebbs and flows in the matches. was he doing something where you could turn around the momentum and gain some momentum in the match?
there can be ebbs and flows where sometimes a match can turn it around a bit.
when you have results like that against federer or djokovic, how do you reset when you walk away from the tournament?
so 10nil. any reason for 10nil against a player? is there something about his game that you find fits yours?
the balls are still flying. he obviously found it difficult at times with flying balls.
were you happy with your play?
next round, novak; obviously a great rivalry. he has the advantage, but the biggest wins of your career all came against him. talk about the rivalry, dynamic, playing him the next round.
you talk about last year was a tough year for you. do you feel like you're starting to get in the form you were in in 2013?
when you're coming off a major surgery, do you recall which came faster for you, the physical or the mental side of just letting yourself go to play again?
mannarino in the last round and lopez this round are very different players. mannarino hits low, flat balls; lopez is spin and net play. how difficult is it to adapt match to match from two different players compared to two similar players?
on this surface with these balls and these conditions, how do you see that playing out with you and novak in the semifinal? how much impact will that have?
can you just discuss your decision to go back to washington this year and why? because obviously you made the final there in '06 and haven't been back since. wondering why this year?
is it tough though with the two backtoback masters right after that? washington, they haven't had any big 4 guys there for since you, but that was sort of before you were in that ranking.
you just mentioned the australian open, and i haven't seen you since then. how long did it take you to get over that loss this time?
another question to your schedule. you added munich ahead of the french open. could you just in a few words say what made you take that decision?
how did you enjoy the radio work?
is that about as good as you have seen andy play? he looked efficient; few flaws today. is that the best you have seen him?
how do you like his chances in the next round? he will play novak and novak will have an extra day's rest with bernard not playing.
what's your evaluation about your tournament? you had a nice run to get here to the quarterfinals. how do you feel about your tournament?
how did it feel playing that match against thanasi today?
what does it change to have thanasi and nick around you? is it less pressure for yourself?
what does it mean at this stage of your career to reach these quarterfinals?
the bernard tomic of 2015, how does he differ from the bernard tomic of 2014?
do you think you're at your fittest compared to the rest of your career?
what can you tell us about the australian players? now there are so many players very good in the tournament, like you here, nick, kokkinakis?
what is your coaching situation? are you working with tony roche? is he your coach?
john isner or djokovic next. what do you think?
have you been disturbed this week by what that young girl said about you and cocaine in your country?
did you feel even more pumped today for this match? it looked like it during the match as you played thanasi.
beginning of the year, beginning january, you have been consistent. has it been exhausting at all? you have played pretty much every week?
you seem to be playing with a lot more intensity on the court than maybe you have on in the past. is that a conscious thing? is that something you tried to keep yourself amped up in matches, or is that just coming with maturity or years going on?
the shouting, the come ons, does that help you kind of seem focused? that's seems new.
talk a little bit about djokovic, who is almost impossible in a lot of ways. hard courts. how do you beat him?
is that the kind of match you like?
is that the best you have hit your groundstrokes this week? seemed crisp pretty much from beginning to end.
do you think the conditions are pretty ideal for you? you get a lot of bounce on your serve. it's not the fastest court in the world.
the knee taping, there are a lot of questions about that. what exactly is it? when did you start doing it?
what are the origins? how did you come up with it?
flavia pennetta was in here yesterday and she said after she dropped the first set of her match she was getting emotional. basically had a mental breakdown. she was crying and yelling. but she came on after that and said she felt much better. the average tennis fan doesn't know what you guys go through to win a tennis match. i'm just wondering if you can talk about the wave of emotions you guys go through in a single match and amplify it in a championship.
have you talked about your next round yet against rafa?
can you also expand about the conditions? i think some people talked about the court being slower and the ball bouncing. that seems to play into rafa's hand, but also sometimes it helps a big server like you. can you talk about these conditions, how it will come into play?
have you watched rafa play here? because unlike clay, he does play closer to the baseline around here. i don't know if you've seen that or what kind of difference you think that might make.
what are your thoughts on wayne odesnik today, and in general the sort of state of antidoping in tennis?
do you think he's totally an outlier, or is there more that you think is going undetected?
just to go back to the next match, how much do you enjoy playing somebody like rafa?
today's match, how good were you feeling on court? everything was going pretty well.
is rafa the most intense guy you have been across the net from?
obviously there is the itf antidoping policies and obviously your national federations. i was just wondering how that breaks down for you and how it applies to you. do you feel like the itf tests you more than the canadian antidoping? vice versa? things like that.
in terms of outofcompetition testing then, is that really the canadian federation carrying that ball testing you like at home as opposed to itf?
when you serve 150 and the crowd gasps and all that, can you rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 the temptation to try to hit it 151, or does it barely even register at this point?
what do you think happened the during the game that you can't win?
give us an assessment of how you think you played today.
does the change in the amount of running room between stadium 1 and stadium 2 affect game tactic, anything at all?
yeah. there is so much on stadium 1. that's very different on stadium 2.
can i get your reaction to wayne odesnik's 15year suspension today? that seems to be one of the longest in the history of the game.
so you feel these people are cheating your sport, making it look bad?
just getting back to the match, do you get any extra information from amlie when it comes to playing a french player?
just back to odesnik for a second. either time he was called it wasn't sort of a tennis test. the first time was at the airport in australia; this time it was the u.s. antidoping agency...
both times he's been caught it hasn't been a test administered by a tennis authority. first time it was at the airport in australia; this time it was the u.s. antidoping agency. does that say anything about maybe the tennis testing not being stringent enough?
is there one thing you have been doing on court this week you're particularly satisfied with? what do you think about meeting lopez now?
you have talked in the past that you've kind of struggled here, but this is going to be the fifth time you have reached the quarterfinals. are you just getting more comfortable? have you been getting more comfortable with the conditions here this year? is there something, a trend with your run here compared to the other times you have been successful at this tournament that's going on?
you spent a long time looking to reach the level set by djokovic, federer, nadal. how would you describe what needs to be done or how do you describe the difference between the four of you and the others?
just a basic kind of question. were you surprised by the odesnik news and why, one way or the other?
i guess you weren't kidding about your fitness the other day.
is the body well enough to play singles and doubles and everything?
are these threesetters helping you just kind of get back in the groove and get a little more match tough after being out so long?
is there something you have been doing to adjust after those slow starts that's clicking or coming together in that regard?
fresh is one thing, but were you surprised you aren't a little more rusty?
could have federer next. talk about that.
did you watch a lot of the ao when you were out?
you mentioned the top 4 guys. you know, since you have been on tour, has one of them stood out as sort of the standard bearer of the men's tour?
not since you have been on tour.
have you played novak?
what do you think would be so difficult about facing each of those guys? break it down.
is there one of them you've wanted to play more than the other?
when you grew up, what was roger to you in terms of was he the guy who was your favorite growing up?
you weren't one of these guys who idolized him growing up? it was more andy?
weren't you kind of the roger federer of the big 4 of nebraska high school tennis?
undefeated, right?
you were like the federer.
can you talk a little bit about your doubles success? gulbis said you weren't missing anything.
are you planning to play together all year?
you spoke about the conditions on the court. what was affecting you out there?
considering the fact that you lost last year in this round, does it give you a sense of relief making it through this year?
do you prefer the drier conditions here? can you give a comparison with melbourne and here related to fatigue, cramping?
gilles hasn't won against you, djokovic, or federer since 2008. do you think he's more dangerous than five or six years ago?
yes.
issues with the balls on the tour are not new. is there anything players can do about it, or just accept and deal with it?
a few nights ago you came off the practice court and you were talking with some people in the field. there were hundreds of people in the dark waiting for you to come and screaming your name. i was wondering, at what point in your life, in your career, did you realize, this is normal for me? i'm standing here having a conversation and everybody is screaming, rafa, rafa? and also, when you go over to sign, is it difficult to make a decision, knowing that it will take a long time or that no matter how many things you sign there will still be people who don't get signatures? talk to me about that a little.
as you know, everybody no doubt knows you are a real madrid fan. after four days there is a el clasico between real madrid and barcelona. what can you tell me about this game and your expectation for this soccer game?
how is it today playing a left hander, playing another left hander particularly in these conditions, because donald is lefty?
since 2014 you have played 30 deciding sets. three set or five sets, you have won 27 of them.
what do you tell yourself when you're going into the third or fifth set that allows you to focus and come through those tight matches?
fernando can be tough to play at any time. can you talk about the match? is it more relief that you were able to get through such a tough opponent so early in the draw?
why was his serve giving you more trouble than some other guys you played?
earlier andy murray said the conditions are part of the reason why he has trouble at times, too. is it also the case for you, too? the high temperature affects your game?
how far do you think you can reach in the tournament?
how is it feeling?
was it mentally or physically at the end?
what happened at the start of the third set? you seemed to be quite in a tough position. do you think this is a kind of match that's going to help you improve and it's important to win?
what is it about you mentally that you were able to not only win the match but, like you said, giving away breaks, the whole thing with the challenges, there were a lot of obstacles today. you managed to keep it together.
can you tell us what's going through your mind the last ten days since the davis cup and the three wins here?
you looked almost cramping at the end of the third set, so can you talk about your physical condition and what kind of thoughts went through your mind at that time?
you're one win away from breaking into top 100. what would it mean to you to get it at this age, so young in your career?
a lot of players get through a period where they feel like that's the breakthrough when they are young. how does it feel for you? from the outside for us, looks like this might be a breakthrough. are you feeling that?
what went through your mind after the first match point at 54. have you seen the replay of it since?
you get through that aspect not having any challenges, you're probably thinking you can't believe this, and there is the not up call, which was a legitimate thing, but the call was wrong. do you think, well, what next?
you're part of the future generation of australian young tennis players. how good can you guys be? how far can you make it, you can kyrgios?
obviously a good win for you. probably your best of the year, easily.
what were your thoughts on what went right out there?
when you came in here you talked a little bit about your disappointment about what happened at davis cup. these two matches are great wins and performances. are you exorcizing those demons? getting back on track?
djokovic potentially next. probably the best of the big four matchups for you in your career. you have beat him here before.
looking at incredible stats here. you lost a total of seven points on serve.
yeah.
so you get up a break and it's like...
how often did you play him in college?
really?
you just know you will step out there and it will be one bomb against another bomb?
there is kind of an idea of players, when you return to a tournament that you played so well at, that it all kind of comes back; that there is a confidence factor and all that sort of stuff. is that overblown?
why do you think this start to the year was slow for you? something in the offseason that wasn't set up or...
looking further ahead, do you have big clay goals this year? you talked about you like the surface a lot. you haven't done that great i guess in madrid or rome. is that something...
on the tennis channel, justin was saying this morning that you guys had that long drive from lax out here to kind of talk about everything. that conversation, is it mostly a mental thing or is it a checkin?
you looked really good. anything different this year?
this was a really big win for you. jeremy chardy is a seeded player. he didn't seem to serve very well today, but what did you do to not get distracted from your game?
couple years ago you beat andy murray here early. is there something special for you about playing here?
some of the players earlier this week were talking about maybe they know the conditions, the ball flies, but the courts are slow. seems like some players this year are struggling to adjust to it this year. have you noticed anything with the conditions?
at break point in the second set where you were able to come back from love30 to get up 42, really kind of seemed like the breaking point in that set for him. talk about, you know, how you felt like that kind of turned the match in your favor.
is this your first match on court 1 here, or have you played there before?
what was it like have a little bit of fan support there playing the first match of the day? seemed like the crowd was really behind you.
you had some good results in delray beach and memphis. is this the year for you to break through and win some titles?
can you talk about the next round? pretty good opportunity.
with the murray match a couple years ago, is there something from that you can draw on when you play a big match against rafa here at this tournament?
what do you remember from that 2008 match against rafa?
you're a student of the game. serena williams' serve. what do you notice about it that's so impressive even among men? people seem to be really impressed by it.
in the past you used to win quite a few points serve and volley using kick serve from the advantage side. you don't seem to be doing that anymore. is there a reason why?
given the change in conditions and everything else and your history, recent history with bolelli, this was theoretically a dangerous match for you. did you do anything different from last year? why was it relatively routine, given the challenges?
what are the differences between vancouver and here?
dolgopolov next round. same situation as last match?
when you were saying you were working to impose yourself in the match, what do you actually mean by that?
talk about that monotone. is that sort of just being flat? do you ever get even a little bored? does your concentration wane? talk about that.
what's your typical selftalk when you want to shake yourself out of that and get going?
do you congratulate yourself?
how often have guys played against you the way dolgopolov did last year?
how much was the fall to do with the result? did that really throw you off when you served for it?
what was your thought process as to whether or not to take the trainer or wave the trainer off after you fell?
took them a while to get out on the court anyway.
if he came out immediate, do you think you would have at least taken a look at it, or would you have waved it off?
did it start to feel better as a few points went on?
how concerned are you? i mean, are you going to stay off it for quite a while? what are your thoughts at the moment?
you said the conditions were tough out there. do you find it hard as a shot maker, flashy shot maker to, you know, put away points with the slower conditions?
it was a very entertaining and highquality match to watch. while you were playing it, what did you think? how much did you enjoy the match?
you usually take less than 20 seconds to serve. the rule is forcing the slow servers to adapt it. can you talk a little bit about it?
no, about the slow servers that take more than 20 seconds to serve.
up until that point you were saying that you thought it was an average kind of match. do you chalk that up more to conditions? why do you think it was not the best match?
what do you take away? you just said coming back from the injury against a guy who is hovering around the top 10 and kind of have the match on your racquet.
how would you describe your style of play? very exciting player obviously. in your words, how would you describe it? who are your influences? who are the guys that you grew up and liked their style and that you maybe emulated?
earlier in the week you sounded a bit concerned about getting out and practicing and getting used to the conditions. how did it go today with that in mind?
i appreciate that it's a different type of tournament, different city and all that sort of stuff. how much do you look forward to playing seppi?
you played doubles yesterday. i think i saw you say regarding davis cup you didn't know the tactics in doubles were so extreme. i was wondering if you could explain what that meant and what kind of adjustments you make going from singles to doubles?
i just saw that were asking some of your hockey friends what they thought about the mayweatherpacquiao fight. can you talk about your thoughts about the fight, and did you also get a chance to meet either of the fighters? andy said he met manny last year.
i caught the end of the justin gimelstob interview. he asked you about your longevity. you said you sort of planned it this way. i just want to get it straight. can you expand on that or go into that?
you're having a very good year. how do you feel physically? and about your team 8 global agency, do you have any expectancy to sign new athletes?
how are you feeling physically?
you were just talking about longevity. are you still learning about how to play and changing things, or has that now plateaued?
have you tried to talk with martin the last few days? what you do you think about the situation created by him and davis cup?
(indiscernible.)
we are starting to see a few younger players coming up. i was wondering if you recall yourself when you're watching yourself and how you compare yourself now at that age?
sort of a strange end to the match there a little bit, eh?
you were aware that he was hurting, obviously, yeah?
can you give us a sense of what makes his serve so difficult to break?
can you talk about the season overall, your season?
there was a little bit from frustration i guess in acapulco.
when you were just talking about adjusting things or working on aspects of your game, what are the priorities for you that you feel have been attended to first, second, third?
you take less than 20 seconds to serve. the rule is forcing the slow servers to adapt. could you comment about this a little bit?
he's a very different style of player. how would you characterize kyrgios' style of play?
this was billed as a sort of future generation match. were you happy to have won it because of that? is nick the best player younger than you that you've played?
can you talk about your match today, how you thought you performed and how it went out there?
did you think that your kind of form right now, do you feel good enough that you might be able to make a run here at indian wells?
can you talk a little bit about that first set? it was kind of weird because i think in the whole set there were only three holds of serve. was that just both returning well, or was there something with the conditions that made it hard to hold serve that first set?
but is there something about the conditions here? because i was looking at some other matches. it looks like a lot of people, even guys who are great servers, were struggling with their serves. whether it's double faults or holding serve, is there something with the conditions here this year that makes it tough on the serve?
you have had such an interesting career; done such an outstanding job. where is donald young now with your win? can we see you as the winner of this tournament?
you have had a big seed change since last year. what's changed in your game, people around you, or your outlook?
why do you think you know yourself better? what's going on in your life?
even though davis cup didn't produce a win for you, what positives can you still take away for the rest of the year as being part of a davis cup team and that sort of experience and the work that you had to put in as far as being part of that team?
i know you played a little doubles with jarmere jenkins. are you surprised there is such a bevy of young black female players who are starting to come up? you're still pretty much holding up the fort for the young black american tennis players.
you spoke of mental toughness. as i look at you i see a very more mature donald young who seems to be more at peace with yourself at this point in time. what has created more of that peace in your life?
just knowing yourself, i mean, have you gotten your own place in atlanta? have you taken other steps to be your own person, becoming independent? can you talk about that a little bit?
when did you get your own place?
do you ever see a time when you wouldn't be coached by your parents or they wouldn't have some role in your tennis?
tony trabert said a while back if we weren't able to get black and hispanic kids playing tennis we'd see a downturn in our game. we are seeing a downturn on the men's side, which you have been asked about probably thousand time. do you agree with that, that in order to maybe see an upturn to american tennis it would be best to get the black and hispanic players involved?
do you feel there is underlying or aboveground prejudice in the game when you walk around as one of the only black players on the tour?
one of the exciting things since i have been here, just to fill in people like the leaders, like simon and moore, and serena spoke of ellison and those other persons. there is a feel that we want to really create a multicultural type of environment here. do you have any comments in that regard?
healthwise, how do you feel right now, coming back from the long layoff?
can you talk a little bit about first set looked like maybe a slow start. took you a while to get into the match maybe?
i think you were going to play in february but it didn't really work. what was happening there?
what was the root of the injury, the root problem? was it a onetime thing?
that was right after paris?
little disappointing, because you actually had a good fall.
your brother came here, correct?
he must be feeling a lot better?
during the match today were you thinking about like winning for him? did that add more pressure to it?
if i heard you right, were you saying silver lining of the injuries you're in the best shape you think you have ever been in in your career?
did you lose weight? gain weight?
sounds tedious.
dropshots in the third set, was that trying to shorten points because of your foot or more tactical?
how happy would you be this year by the end of the year? top 30? 20? 15? slams? where are you, do you think?
i don't know what you did last year going over to europe for the clay court season, but are you going to have a different strategy or different schedule going over there this year? what's the schedule?
stay through wimbledon?
was that a rip in your shoe?
how did you get it ripped? looked ripped on top.
can you talk a little bit about the third set? you had the early break and then he broke back. can you just talk about like the change of momentum and what you did to get it back to finish out the match?
surprised he didn't go for that?
a lot was made of the choice not to select you to represent the united states in the davis cup. i know you have a lot of respect for captain courier and all of the guys who would be your teammates, but how much have you talked to courier about it? how much do you think your experience at usc being a part of the team dynamic and being successful, would make you a viable candidate to play on that team?
you have played so well lately. have you done anything different? changed anything?
you face ivo again.
what were you thinking? presumably you were watching. couple of really tough days on the road. what were your thoughts just watching?
yeah.
so your team talks about your tremendous play as a team player, and you have had a lot of experience in hostile sites. i presume athens and i presume westwood is not that much fun going east and all of a sudden being told, guess what? you have to play indoors for the championship. all that comes to mind. but what did you learn from that? would that help you as a davis cup player, having to go into such a hostile atmosphere?
if i could follow up, what was the toughest road atmosphere for you to go to with college? how does that compare to the toughest atmosphere you have had to play on the circuit?
is that really hard to overcome? do you feel like...
one of the things i have admired about your father and some other people as they were speaking and regards to american tennis in regards to men and boys, do you all feel that at this point in time that you can be no.1? is there an attitude of i can do it? we could be in the top 5 again? are we getting those types of attitudes and we support you or we are behind you? do you feel that you really can make it to the top 5?
looking at our boys, american boys that are 10, 11, 12 years old  i will use those ages  what would you tell them? you're out there and you know what needs to be accomplished. what would be the first thing or what would you tell them they need to do at this point in time in order to be no.1?
it is great to see. so easy to root for you and john and the guys that did play college tennis. it's kind of ebbed and flowed philosophically with respect to whether a pro prospect should bother with college tennis or just go straight in. you know, you and john did and jack and donald didn't. at this point when you look at college tennis, do you think it has enough to offer to help a guy?
you and a lot of americans are comfortable here in hard courts and it's the u.s. looking ahead, there have been different sort of strategies about going over to europe for the clay. some go early and some go late. what's your plan at this point?
montecarlo and come back to the states after that?
sort of a locker room question: when all is said and done, surfaces, slow, hard court, who do you think the best would be between roger, rafa, and novak?
and the one or two things that are great about it is the arsenal of the shots or just a management of matches and career?
roger.
who was your idol when you were young?
quite an amazing night all round.
looked a lot more comfortable in the second set. was it nerves or working your way in or that's the way you wanted to play it?
if you had one regret, would that be maybe your first serve percentage?
even though you didn't win it, what was it like to be a part of occasion, a milestone for your opponent?
was there a feeling in 2013 when things weren't going so well that he was in a terminal decline, and has he surprised people in the locker room by the way he's come back?
your performance tonight, does that make you excited for the season ahead?
is this the best you've felt to start the year ever?
meant to you ask you earlier in the week, is that a compression sock you wear on your arm?
to support the muscles?
you mentioned about being capable of something big at the australian open. how big? are you genuine contender for those titles now?
what does 1000 mean to you?
is there something you can remember from every single win of those wins, are they just a blur?
it's a physically demanding number. the match tonight looked like it was a lot of hard work.
you're currently trending worldwide #roger1000. do you ever get overwhelmed with the support across the globe?
if you won in melbourne i think you would be the oldest australian champion for about 40 years. you think you got another one in you?
jimmy connors got 1250 wins. given how long and much effort has gone into getting 1000, do you think you could keep playing long enough to challenge his record?
you said some encouraging words about milos out there. do you get excited when you see the level of talent coming through, players like him?
how high can your girls count yet? to a 1000?
very close with him overall; 76 in the third. last couple games you kind of jumped on it him and snagged it. just talk about it.
did you expect to play so good so early in the season?
what about physically how did you feel? it was a long game with a lot of points and a lot of rallies.
your coach, riccardo, told me your offseason was the most impressive offseason he has ever seen. can you explain what you did?
talk about potentially playing roger. you've played him enough now. you finally got him in paris a couple months ago, but he's been tough overall. how do you beat him?
nishikori pointed out couple of reason why he couldn't win today based on the first set experience. he said he tended to wait for you to make some errors. did you feel something like that?
when you see wawrinka and cilic winning grand slams last year, does that give you ideas, and is that your goal for this year?
were you able to take a real vacation and kind of relax and have a nice time, or it was immediately back and work?
that's not that long.
did you feel like you needed to relax, that it's been a long year, that type of thing?
as a young emerging players, you and kei may have more opportunity to play in a big tournament. how do you prepare for that, and what would you do?
do you have any regret on this match, or do you think there was nothing to do?
do you see any change in his game since the us open and the big match that you had?
you've obviously got a lot more people following you around now mediawise. how conscious are you of how important you are for asian tennis?
when you made the quarterfinal at the us open in 2012 to reaching the final in new york last year, obviously a couple years to get to that stage. were you starting to doubt you were capable of that, or did you always feel confident?
how close do you feel to winning a grand slam?
what do you take out of a match like today with three tiebreakers and no breaks of serve? is it a hard way to lose?
what do you take going into the doubles final tomorrow? is that still important?
do you have a dinner appointment or something? didn't seem to want to hang around tonight.
obviously a win would see you get to a thousand tour wins in your career. does something like that motivate you, or do you think about it at all?
jimmy and ivan are the only two players that have done it. pretty rare company.
can you name one match that stood out of the rest in your 999?
obviously you did the job today on grigor; chance to take on another young rising star in milos tomorrow. what do you expect?
talk about the comparison between how the conditions play day and night. you have a night final tomorrow.
i have a tricky question: do you know how many titles you have won on the tour in different...
yeah.
28
for somebody who has been on the tour so long and won in so many places, is that something that still is sort of a little bit of an extra drive, to go somewhere where you haven't won?
just generally, roger, coming into this year compared to last year, given 2014 was a much better year for you, how much better do you feel about your game than 12 months ago?
talk a little bit more about milos. do you think he's gotten better in the last year? can he be top 5? is he that good already?
milos.
yeah, yeah.
he was hot in the first set, wasn't he?
is that what you have to try and work out, bernie, how you get into those sets when you feel like things are going against you?
same energy levels that you had against querrey and thanasi?
you still feel vulnerable against the really, really good movers on the tour?
is it frustrating that the brisbane international is only a bestofthree when you seem to be coming back in the second and all of a sudden it's over? would it be better to go bestoffive.
back to sydney?
will you do doubles like you did here, or just focus on singles?
how much are you going to play after the australian open? are you going to go straight into playing hard courts in the states? you got a schedule?
that was always going to be about serve, that match. given that you talked about the improvement in your own serve over the offseason, how do you think that went?
what about towards the end you seemed to show some emotion. most of it you were pretty calm. obviously meant a lot to finally make it over the line.
those games help going into a tournament like the australian open, to have a game where you're pushed in a couple big tiebreakers?
what would you say you need to clean up in your game?
when you're playing against another big serving player or player with a big serving reputation, do you go into these tournaments thinking more about how you're going to combat his serve or you try to outpower him with your serve?
so you think it's a good experience to get out of the way.
you got your game plan that you believe in. does it give you extra confidence?
that was a very impressive first set. tell us about it.
yeah, singles.
you stepped it up a level from the second round?
a very different match again for the semifinal.
you're a human being, so i'm sure you felt for james; but you're also a professional tennis player that has to win a game. how did those two play off each other tonight?
you ever been on the end of a loss like that? if so, how did you get over it?
is it bad to have a match like that before taking on someone like dimitrov?
only two times you played him were indoors.
yeah. it's out outdoors and humid. do the game styles change much? do you expect him to be a bit different?
i have question about yesterday. you said that you practice in dubai with david goffin.
what do you think of his last season, and do you think that he could reach top 10 maybe this year?
novak lost; rafa as well. for years there's been talk about the big 4 and closing of the gap. you're in the last four with three of the young up and comers. do you feel now that gap is really, really close, much closer than it ever has been before?
i wanted to ask you this last night. you're obviously the main draw card for this event. is it silly to ask if you feel the expectation of an event like this?
you should probably tell us. it wasn't obviously the match you in any way, shape, or form wanted. thoughts on it? what was it like trying to compete in that match?
was it him? the atmosphere? packed house? center court? him being a 17time grand slam champion and it's a packed center court, did the occasion overwhelm you a little?
john gave him a pretty good workout last night. maybe that played against you. he got enough court time to get nicely wound up for tonight.
did you have a chat with john about what he got out of last night's match?
what do you do to get over something like that? do you do your normal thing? go out your dinner? try to talk about it? shut it out of your mind?
how important is it to not let tonight's result overshadow this week?
in your world, is that a good serving day or an exceptional serving day or what?
have you played doubles with bernard much in the past?
practice with him here again?
can i ask you for an evaluation of where he is? obviously there is all the scrutiny on his progress over the years. can you tell me how you see him doing at the moment?
i know your opponent hasn't been decided yet, but could be sam groth. if it is, another big server. you only played him i think once before.
thoughts on him? he's improved himself like bernard and really stepped up this year.
yes. was it washington?
next question: your own game, only the first tournament of the year. how do you feel?
can you tell in the first couple games of the season where you game is?
you've been included in the group of players who are on the verge or cusp of a breakthrough. is that going to happen this season in the majors for you?
playing out on one of the outside show courts today there was music. is that an unusual experience around the world's circuit or quite commonplace now with pop music playing loudly?
tell us your feelings. i think you saved some break points at 43; could have gone 53.
he's where you want to be. he'd been in the top 100 for four years and then had an injury last year and dropped out. he's where you want to be, no.41 in the world.
how you going to back up? pretty long match; two and a half hours; three sets. what are you going to do tonight?
there is always so much talk about your serve. first two points of the tiebreak, backhand winners. the backhand really serves you well, doesn't it?
milos next. thoughts?
few more aces.
a bit like playing yourself in some respects servicewise. how do you read the serve, or do you just try and position yourself?
no, no, tomorrow.
how do you deal with the expectations now? it does different things to different players, but how do you handle it?
i think your fastest serve is 232. can you get it any faster?
what did you make of john's match out there tonight? what did you make of him i guess? probably first time you'd seen him play.
for you, you talk about maybe a little bit of rust at the start. is it good to have a long match probably not what you want but to get some game time?
when you've been around as many years as you have, how do you feel when you start out at a tournament like this? excited again for the start of the new season? just kind of feel like you're going through the motions a bit and you know what you have to do for the aussie open? how does it feel after all these years?
how would you compare your level of confidence if you have to compare with one year ago at the same time?
bernard tomic is on the other side of the draw. there's been talk about his improved maturity and fitness out on the court. have you caught either of his matches? what do you make of him?
i am from japan, so i am hoping to see you play with kei in the final.
would you tell me what you think kei's unique strengths, especially last year?
up against another aussie in james duckworth. are you expecting a similar sort of match to what you had tonight?
what have you been doing offseason, and did it change something to play the exhibition for your preparation?
saved match point in the second set reaching your first quarterfinal on the atp tour. must be quite a night for you.
what did you tell yourself after the second set when you made it a set all?
you talk about your aggression. you can already see through your two matches this year it's gone a step up from last year.
and a fair bit of work on the volleys as well.
dare to dream what your ranking may be after this week?
how long have you been waiting for a result like this?
how far have you set goals? tournament by tournament, or certain things you want to achieve this year?
we asked lleyton hewitt about few emerging young guys the other night, and he smiled when we mentioned your name and said, i love ducks.
do you feel comfortable going to him?
he offers himself up to you?
what's the talk like in the locker room? there are three australians in the quarterfinals, you and sam and bernard.
you've exacted revenge against a couple guys from past brisbane defeats, and you might have the chance to get revenge again with roger federer.
what are your memories about your firstround match against roger at the australian open?
social media following guys talk about the hash tag quack and all that.
how satisfying was that?
when have you played tennis as good as that before, do you think? some of the best you've played in a while.
seemed like raised your level at the right moments when it was tight.
what specifically have you been doing fitnesswise to get in good stuff? particular stuff that you're hating doing but you're forcing yourself to?
are you doing weight training? are you doing rowing machine? are you running? cycling? what are you doing?
how motivated were you tonight to not lose to an 18 year old aussie? you know what i mean?
have you got an opinion a lot of people do on who will be the better in the end out of nick and thanasi?
nishikori next. what's the key to beating him?
last year once you had the surgery, how long did it take to get back to 100%? was there a point you said, yep, i'm back?
give us your feelings on this match, the first one for the tournament.
you weren't us open finalist the previous times you played here. does it change your outlook at all?
you've had to answer a lot of questions about what's the difference between when you were here last time and when you're here now due to the us open. what's different on the court? anything?
because of the season you've had, almost every match you go into now you're the favorite player to win. is that a burden or something you enjoy?
can you give us an indication of what the expectation is back in japan for you to be the first japanese man to win a grand slam? do you feel that expectation?
you'll play an australian no matter what. two australians are playing tonight to face you. will you watch the match?
i guess the big three of men's tennis dominated for so long. the next generation made some inroads last year. do you think the gap can keep closing this year?
how would you rate your first match of the season?
what did you do during offseason? did you go to australia?
when you prepare yourself in the offseason and you talk with roger, do you set goals for the next season?
last year you think that the year was a good season for you? reaching the top 10 i guess meant a lot for you.
did you hear that many people said that it could be your year and you could win your first grand slam this year. what do you think of that?
is there one thing you need to improve to reach top 5 or reach grand slam?
offseason, major changes? little things?
do you feel like you have to be more aggressive consistently?
so top 10, everyone knows you're there. do you see top 5 this year? could you get to no.1? you're playing all the big guys very close now.
great win. must be really excited about the next round and the next matchup?
out on the practice courts early this morning roger had a full gallery watching him practice. you're the local guy. you still have a bit of support out there?
what are your memories of that tournament a couple years ago here? the crowd just loved you. you must have some tremendous memories from that, and using that going forward.
you at all concerned you might have a moment on thursday where you go, i'm playing roger federer, and it might adversely affect you?
was it hard last year not being able to play?
were you really thinking that you might not get back in this level or even playing tennis? is that how bad it was?
was it a reconstruction or...
in the crowd on court 1, were there any spectators that you knew?
i noticed gary stickler was there and mark draper. who are you working with?
all losses are tough, but is there something about it loss today that really bites?
tell us what went through the second set tiebreak there? was there anything in your head?
as entertaining as you are out there, gesturing and the yelling, is it fun to play tennis in australia?
what do you think of your 2014 season? i think it was five atp quarterfinals.
how do you rate it?
what's the plan for the rest of the month?
when did you get the call about well you probably knew about matt's injury. when did you get the call that you were in?
is that the key as well to this month, just try and play as many matches as you can?
going back to sydney?
even though you have to crisscross the country?
incredible watching some of those serves. what was it like facing him today?
did you think he might go off the boil at some point?
had you practiced with him at all?
you touched on his serve and net game. were you surprised at how well he played from the back of the court tonight?
change anything for you in your plans going to melbourne? play sydney?
is there anything you would do differently, or did you feel it was just more about him tonight?
how do you see the guys that are in the up and coming group?
just on that, tomic has been talking about his newfound maturity and focus. you hit with him before this kicked off. any insight site into what you've seen?
just with roger, you have your relationship off court. seem to do a lot of stuff together.
how is that?
paul annacone has come onboard with tennis australia. just your thoughts on that.
got to feel pretty good.
were there nerves coming on court, even though you knew his game that well? defending champion.
(indiscernible.)
what do you do with a win like that? a win like that against a player of the caliber of lleyton, what does that do for you?
top 50 is the next step, isn't it?
you mentioned ben mathias out on court, and ducks what a great win yesterday. tell us a bit about him. we hear he's pretty quiet.
did you take a lot from the us open last year playing federer?
how does the fitness come through? apart from obviously being able to run down all the balls, do you feel stronger on the court? is your mind clear on the court?
bernard, really dealt with his serve well. 20 aces in two sets and won in straight sets.
threehour plus women's match. would have tested your concentration a bit when you were younger, having to go on after that?
you lost a few kilos and you're moving better at the baseline. is movement another thing that's improving in your game?
any residual pain from your hips?
you haven't met kokkinakis before at the atp level. you train and practice with him. most recent thoughts playing against him?
having a big serve against querrey will help you with a big serve against thanasi?
has he improved from last summer? and where in the 12 months?
you talk about experience. are these the matches you don't want to be slipping up in, you should be winning these matches and moving forward in the tournament?
you being around in australian tennis with there being one man in the top 100, two men in the top 100, do you feel if there is some momentum coming in?
you were showing a lot of emotion out there tonight. talk us through the shot you hit to win the first set. you jumped about two feet in the air.
nice way to start the year. feeling like your performance was sort of brewing?
did the feliciano lopez game come into your mind today?
are you through all your back problems and stuff? through the injuries? you're fit?
what's the main thing you took a which from a dubai when you were there?
how different it your perspective on the game from 12 months ago? came into the lleyton hewitt match and you were still the new kid on the block. are there different expectations now when you go out?
you wear the pressure on you that you get when you're mentioned with nick, you wear that pressure and embrace it?
you mentioned davis cup, and james duckworth won before you. seems to be a bit of a (indiscernible) around men's tennis in australia at the moment.
if you do play bernie, what's your relationship like with him and what are your expectations for that match?
who wins?
feel that one coming?
you played very aggressively. is that something you're focusing on more now than before, or did it just work well today?
be great to see your ranking come down; career high at the moment. is that motivational for you as you play, that every game might...
i know you've felt like a top 100 player for couple years now, but has it sort of weighed on your mind that you didn't beat a top 100 player last year?
107
guys like kyrgios coming sort of so fast and sort of overtaking you, is that a spur to see how quickly you can get on a roll and really jump up high with a couple good results?
who is your secondround opponent?
you lost to jarkko last year. have you seen anything since then: see him play at all?
how do you prepare for a match like that? do you look at the most recent match that he played or talk to your coach and other players about him? do you watch any video?
seemed to be a collective mentality among the aussie guys at the movement. is that something you agree with and have felt before, or is it something new?
so the goals for the 12 months ahead for you?
is brisbane feeling like home for you now?
did you share ben with sam?
what would it take for you to make a big breakthrough?
21, is that your highest scalp?
i know it's very soon after the match, but how is your right foot? do you think you'll be okay for shanghai?
you hurt your foot in the second set. to what extent did it affect your game?
in the first set you played very aggressive from both sides, always on your baseline. that's the kind of game you think you absolutely have to do from now till the end?
novak is playing at such a high level now. do you see yourself catching him next season or do you see anyone catching him next season?
looking at the match today, is there anything specific you learned from the match today to get back to his level, to match him again?
in regards to this match, you didn't seem very confident. do you think you're still one of the best players in the world?
this is your 45th encounter with novak. competing so many times with the same player, what kind of feeling is that?
rafa was here saying he felt the first set was tighter than 62. did you feel the same way?
you've played at an incredible level this week. do you think you can keep it up next week?
it seemed tonight in all of those times when you were down 40love or breakpoint, a tight moment for you, you brought your best tennis, and i think you won all of those points. does that make this victory even more pleasing for you?
you've played rafa more times than any other rivalry in men's tennis. this was the first time you played him since roland garros. from the other side of the court, where do you sense his level at at the moment in terms of the improvements he's trying to make?
i'm not sure if you've ever discussed this before, but you always seem to wear red here. now you're in red.
is that a decision you've made with uniqlo?
just brings you luck on the court?
reaching china open final is your best performance on hard courts this year. we can feel that you're getting better on court. what is your plan for tomorrow, especially when it may be that you're up against novak?
how do you assess your level today in the first set and the second? also, the handshake wasn't friendly with fabio. was there any issue during the match or before?
during the match, your uncle toni seemed to show his frustration at something fabio was doing. you've played fabio five times this year. do you sense there's an extra edge to your rivalry, something between you?
are you also working with something on the second serve? you had some unusual doublefaults today.
can you talk a little about playing novak in the final, in case he comes through.
when you play fognini, do you do something special to prepare for today?
you couldn't manage the win today. how do you sum up your performance?
you throw your racquet to the linesman. what was happening?
do you think you play better when nadal is on the other side?
do you think you're developing a bit of a rivalry with nadal? i think you've played him five times this year. there was some sort of argument in hamburg. do you think there's an extra edge when you play rafa?
during the past few years, we have seen lots of players showing tiredness at the end of the season. how did you make it to have more power while others don't?
was it tougher today than the score is saying?
tomorrow is your first final with nadal this year. he's insisting in his press conferences that he's with confidence. do you expect a big battle with him like the old times?
earlier rafa said you're in a different league from him right now. do you see it that way?
your record of 280 here is obviously exceptional. in the course of your career, you've had lots of success. where does that statistic or achievement sit in it for you?
you must be happy because it started pretty tough.
what do you do in a situation like that? sock had 14 winners to 3, playing at a high level. what is your strategy in terms of staying in the match, staying positive, waiting for him to slip a little? what do you tell yourself in that moment?
obviously we're getting towards the end of the season when players are a bit more tired. in 2009 and 2011, i think you played the atp finals and the davis cup final backtoback, backtoback weeks. andy murray said he may consider missing the atp finals this year to play the davis cup final, which is on a different surface. from your experience, how difficult is it to play both and do you understand why he's thinking about that?
what have you been working on specifically since the us open? at this stage in your career, this stage of the year, is it better for you to have a training block or better to have match play?
you could be playing fognini next. will that match have any extra edge to it? would it mean anything more to you playing him next after the us open?
over the past year, you managed to make a semifinal on hard courts for the first time. does it mean a lot to you?
when speaking of your academy, not everyone can become a professional tennis player. it's an opportunity for them to go to college. you started to play tennis at three years old. maybe at one point of your life, have you thought about doing something else instead of playing tennis?
the other day when you were talking about your academy, you said you set up a program to help the kids who would not be the professional athletes, to go into the college, to help them find another way to live. my question is, you started very early playing tennis, i think it was the age of three maybe. have you ever thought about another option at any point of your career?
yes, maybe.
in the first set, john was 85% of first serves, and you're winning 62. do you feel like you're still improving even at the end of the season?
talk a little about your new trick shot. did you put a lot of thought into it or was it something that came off when you were practicing?
off the return.
towards the end of the season, a lot of players are tired. you certainly don't seem to be. 2010 and 2013, you played the atp finals and davis cup finals backtoback one week after the other. obviously andy murray will have to do that this year with a change of surface. given your experience of doing that in the past, how tough is that? how tough will it be for him if he has to change surface?
your opponent, he's already the best player we can get, but still very far from you. is there any positives you can take from his game? do you think he has top 100 potential?
i'm sure you've answered this question before about your record here. that's 26 wins and zero losses. you've only lost three sets and you've never had a match longer than two hours. is it purely down to conditions?
you played many dropshots today. i was wondering if there was a tactical reason or when it's on you find it fun?
we know you visited the great wall this week. chinese people can make a great wall, but cannot produce a tourlevel player. are you surprised we have players from japan and korea, but why not from china?
after you have competed with so many asian players, including chinese players, have you found that asian players have some physical weaknesses compared to western players?
it was a good battle out there tonight. are you more satisfied with your sensations today than the previous one?
if preparing for next season is your big goal, do you feel the pressure is off you in some ways?
do you feel there is less pressure if you are more practicing for next season than going for this title?
for this tournament.
your next opponent is jack sock. what are your thoughts on that match?
you came to beijing very late. did that affect your performance today? how different are the playing conditions here from last week?
you have been trying to qualify for london many years, and qualifying many years. is it different this year? is it getting easier to deal with the pressure?
what do you think cuevas did well today in the match?
you weren't expecting it would be that tough to adjust from shenzhen? did you think it would be okay to start right away?
maybe next week you will go to shanghai. it will be the first time you have been in china for three weeks. how do you feel staying so long in china? do you like the asian season?
you played well today. during the second set, actually you were up a break. did you think that you may win? what did you feel at that time?
previously during the davis cup, you played very well during the fivesetters. but you felt fatigue playing nadal. why?
today you played rafa. although rafa was not 100%, it's a good chance to measure your level of play. after this match, how can you assess your improvement during this year?
last week in shenzhen you lost very quickly. do you feel confident after today's match?
what kind of lessons have you learned from today's match?
during this match, some of your shots were very good. as for the toplevel players, they play very consistently. can you maybe improve your consistency in the near future?
including you and some other chinese players, you have taken a lot of opportunities, such as main draws at the grand slams, the china open. compared with the toplevel players, such as rafa, or the top50 players, you have the opportunity to play with them. the problem is that we still have lowerranked players. i think we must have the strategies to improve our rankings. what is the solution or the approach?
can you talk about your coaching situation. what kind of improvements or suggestions are given by your coach?
you said previously you were independent, without a coach. right now you have this good coach and a trainer, as well. do you need something else in order to make a breakthrough?
just now you said that you have been a ball boy for rafa.
were you happy with how your forehand started to come good at the end of the second set and with how you closed out the match after being down 42?
do you think it's an issue of confidence or rhythm, just getting into the rhythm of playing again?
how much did you know about your chinese opponent in the match? he played way better than his ranking suggested. he told us before he used to serve as your ball boy and sparring partner. what do you think about his game?
would you say that nowadays you have better sensations in practice than competing or is it the same?
you are the best player in tennis history. also your country has a lot of great tennis players, won plenty of davis cups, grand slam titles, the gold medal. do you have any advice for chinese men's tennis development?
can i ask you about the pollution, what it's like to play in it?
it's been a big day for you in singles and doubles. talk about which of the matches you played gave you more satisfaction today.
what kind of part do you still play in your brother's career? you know how tough it is to make it in tennis.
talk a bit about your next match. it's against zheng ze, the chinese player. you have great support here. do you think there will be split loyalty in the crowd?
i know you have competed with a lot of asian players such as nishikori from japan. can you share with us some of the features or the differences between japanese players with chinese players.
you play all kinds of asian players. tell us what kind of difference between japanese players like nishikori and the chinese players you have ever played?
what was the difference today in terms of what allowed andy to beat you? do you see yourself and andy as being maybe the next biggest rivalry in tennis?
you seemed to have a little problem with your right elbow. you mentioned it yesterday.
can you talk about the conditions out there, the heat, how that affected the play today.
you're talking about your arm. does it worry you as we're getting near the us open?
it was your first loss in about 30 games in a masters. how do you feel now that this streak is over?
how tough was it mentally to lose the fifth game that lasted like forever?
you've beaten andy the last eight times you played since wimbledon 2013. was this a better andy murray that you played today?
is there anything wrong with you physically?
is there anything wrong with you physically, injurywise, sickness?
is it an injury or only you're tired more because of yesterday?
at what stage did you feel it was getting worse and you couldn't perform as you wanted?
is this a leg injury? do you have something, a physical problem?
but there's a problem with one of your legs?
does this have anything to do with the calf injury from wimbledon?
how did you feel about the crowd reaction in the second set? how did you feel about it, the crowd reaction?
you're now no.2 in the world again. what is your feeling about that, getting closer to the top spot?
tomorrow novak. what changes do you see you have to make to make the no.2 no.1 hopefully?
you haven't had much success against novak since the wimbledon final two years ago. what is it that has taken him to the next level, the components that make up his game that allowed him to push further and really establish him as the no.1 player in the world?
you exchanged breaks. he's serving 34, 30all. he misses the downtheline shot. it seemed his level dropped, physically he dropped, and you took it to another level. did you sense he was dropping a little bit?
do you think the way you played tonight, especially the latter part of the match, gives you the encouragement and confidence to face novak tomorrow? do you still think there's spots in your game you need to improve?
this week novak has said some very nice things about you. is this a rivalry wrapped up in a friendship or just a rivalry wrapped up in an intense rivalry?
what time did you end up going to bed yesterday? did that affect you at all today, even if your opponent wasn't really there in the second set?
so you're staying up till 3:00 tonight again?
what was the challenge for you going from facing two super tall players to the challenge that djokovic places for you? does that make it more difficult for you? in general, what makes novak so difficult to play against?
yesterday you said you would try something new this time against novak. what did you try?
you have the smile of someone who is very, very satisfied maybe with the whole week. could you tell us how you feel. you won four matches and your ranking is going to go up. how do you analyze this week? how do you see the future from now on?
were you a bit nervous at the start, the first game when you served?
how do you feel playing against the best player in the world?
is this the most emotional week you ever had in your career?
yesterday the match lasted at least three hours with all the rain delays. did you feel a bit tired for this match?
in the second set, his serve was very tough for you. can you talk about his serve in the second set.
were you surprised you were so dominant on his serve tonight?
your first win in eight tries against him.
some people say he's not the same player. would you say he's not the same player?
did you feel he was a different player?
yes.
your game seems very sharp. you seem very on top of form. how do you explain your game is reaching such a high level?
(question regarding how he is feeling at such a late hour).
you might play against murray tomorrow. what are your thoughts on that?
you played a very aggressive game tonight. what part of your game were you most impressed with on the aggressive side, forehand, backhand?
john obviously was coming in the last few weeks playing very well. very big hitter. how do you adjust your play going in against such a strong server?
three hours, three tiebreakers. does that feel like one of the craziest matches you've ever had?
after the rain delay, you won three games in a row. how did you prepare during the rain delay? did you think that was key for the match, the way you came back after the rain?
there were seven matchpoints against you. you won all of them. some of them were on your serve obviously. was there pressure there with the match on the line?
i'm assuming you have more gas left in the tank for tomorrow. we don't know your opponent. give us your scouting report on if you're facing nole or gulbis.
some of the current wave of guys like raonic and john who have such a booming serve. it changes the way you approach a match, but does it change the way you enter it at all? do you go into it the same way regardless of who the server is?
did the break because of the rain help you to start again because there was a big change? you were down and then you broke him back.
what happens in your mind when you know you have to save a breakpoint and he's serving?
it's been many years that you've been on the tour now. how does it feel to be in a semifinal of a masters series, which is quite rare for a player that is only in the top 50?
what about the crowd? they supported you.
most masters 1000s take place in areas where there is almost never any rain. here it rained a lot. are you talking amongst the players about the rain here, that we might need a roof?
in the last few years, a lot of talk about the big four. you have certainly dominated the majors. of the upcoming youngsters, who do you see as the next challengers?
your thoughts on youzhny tonight? ranked 107 of the world, but at times he didn't look like it.
what are your thoughts on the kyrgios affair?
murray blamed it on his age maybe, how tough it is to grow up in the spotlight. would you say his age excuses something? and how do you feel about your win on this lefthanded international day?
could you talk to us about how you feel about your serve. your average speed is a lot higher in this tournament than it was in hamburg. you have two different surfaces, but it's a considerable improvement.
now the problem's gone?
you're playing tomorrow night in singles and right after in doubles. how do you prepare for that?
it's the bryans in doubles.
how do you feel you played on the pressure points tonight?
your thoughts on the singles match?
was that something that you were doing well or he was doing poorly, the serve?
i know you weren't particularly looking forward to playing jamie in doubles. talk to me about the experience. was it as bad as you anticipated?
there is a chance you'll play tsonga in the next round, in the quarterfinals. he beat you in the quarterfinals of the rogers cup last year. how is that challenge for you?
i'm sure you're well aware of the events involving nick kyrgios over the last 24 hours, the various reactions to them. can i ask your thoughts on anything that happened last night?
both last night, the actual events, and in response.
can you elaborate a little bit on the difference between here and toronto.
seems to be some bubbles on the main court. is that a problem for the players at all?
even when it cleared, it looks like the court is sweating a little bit. they're out there with towels a lot.
what's going on with your leg (referring to the taping)?
since you didn't have much rest since washington, how do you feel coming here? is the surface faster than washington or just the same or...
after making the us open final last year, do you go into the hard court season this year thinking that you could have another run like that in new york this year?
today most of the top players are very big guys, tall people. you're not that tall. how do you manage that? how are you able to beat these guys? it just seems to be a big man's game now.
the washington post ran a big story on you last week. i'd like to know how comfortable you are with the kind of role of a pioneer that's been given to you for tennis in japan and asia in general.
do you have any source of pride to know it seems like every time you reach a certain level, you're always the first asian to reach those levels? any specific pride from that?
it seems that your game adapts really well to hard surfaces. you had a great season last year. now you won washington already. what is the plan to succeed on hard court?
because you've spent a lot of time in the states, has the us open become the closest to a home grand slam for you?
what do you think was the change or development that has propelled you to this higher level?
you made steady progress over the last couple years. can you go higher? what do you have to do to get better, to be no.1?
we feel that your generation, like milos raonic, dimitrov and you, for instance, is close to taking over the older guys who have been there for a long time, many guys in their 30s. how do you explain that those guys are still very good? what's missing for your generation to take that final step?
how is it to get back in your rhythm on that surface?
early in the tiebreaker, you had that exchange where you had a couple chances for the big killer overhead smash. your opponent stayed alive. does having the opportunity for those plays bring out the beast or killer instinct in you?
do you prefer starting with a tougher match like that or starting with an easier match? is it easier to find your groove with a tougher opponent like that?
it's been a disappointing year for you so far by your high standards.
do you feel with a deep run here you have a chance at the us open?
this is the second time this week that you mentioned not having any points in the computer from last year. how does that make you feel? does it make you feel a little bit more relaxed knowing that you don't have any points to defend?
on a day when you have a singles match and a doubles match, i saw your practice this morning, it looked like a hard, long session. do you believe that work ethic gets you back to no.1 or are there people saying that you don't have to work so hard, take it easy on your body now?
scotland is hardly known as a hotbed of tennis. what do you attribute your ability to come out of scotland and play the level that you do?
3 hours, 20 minutes last time you played tommy. how relieved are you it wasn't that long today?
now that you've had some time to practice a bit more, because you didn't have as much court time because of the davis cup, what is your feeling about your game?
talk about playing jamie for the first time competitively tomorrow.
the past few days it's been quite chilly and wet. you normally train in miami, which is different than here. we're heading towards the season that has the us open where the conditions are normally hot and humid. do you think it's a disadvantage to have to play in these kind of conditions which are different than what you're going to find in the rest of the summer?
obviously we know now where the davis cup semifinal is going to be played, in glasgow at the emirates. give me your thoughts on that.
the break in the second set, a little bit of help from lu on that one?
yes.
tough one with isner coming in. big server.
how did the body hold up?
how intrigued are you by the possibility of potentially facing off against milos again down the road? that's got to be in the back of your mind.
can you talk about the experience of getting back out there on the court, memories of two years ago, what that experience was like for you.
since we last saw you here two years ago, how have you gone about grinding away to be a better player, to be more mentally tough, tactically strong out there? where has your focus been?
on a day like today where the weather is uncertain, how are you towards the waiting game? is it something that's easy for you or something that makes you a bit more nervous?
regarding isner next match, considering he's played quite a lot of tennis in the last couple of weeks, is it in the back of your mind, your strategy regarding your preparation?
you're satisfied with the victory?
how does it feel to be back in montral after so much success you had here?
what is it about montral that you have so much success here?
on your serve it seemed difficult to win the first point. what happened?
are you thinking already about john isner?
are you pleased with that performance?
(question regarding playing a lefthander.)
(indiscernible).
what about your match with stan?
doubles now with lleyton hewitt. tell us about that relationship, how it came about.
is 'mentor' a word you would use?
how will you stay away from that backhand?
how permanent would it be with lleyton? weektoweek, monthtomonth?
how much does that decision indicate how serious you are about the davis cup? that's obviously going to help in the davis cup semifinal.
you've had boris with you for several months now. can you list three aspects you feel he's brought to your game.
what kind of match did you expect today? were you satisfied with how you came out to start on the court?
you said a couple days ago that you think this is your best year since 2011. do you think you're a better player now than you were then? if so, can you say in what ways?
can you take us through the crazy exchange that you had during the tiebreak near the end and what kind of effect does it have on you?
do you ever get in zones where you feel invincible, unbeatable? how close are you to being in one of those zones?
you've talked a lot over the last year about what a fantastic impact personally and professionally having a child has had on you. have you spoken to andy murray since his news broke?
what do you feel in this match, so complicated? the brazilian normally has an old style like guga kuerten. this tennis man was strong for you on the field.
where do you feel your game is right now overall?
127
you mentioned you played a little bit better today than you have in a while. what did you like that you did today?
what is your hunger level right now? you've been at this a long time. especially this year, not making the slams. what is your hunger level, what keeps you motivated?
it's easy to understand how you train physically, how you rehab an injury. when you're struggling mentally, can you explain how you work on that, what you do to get that mental strength back.
a lot of your losses were of the more difficult, heartbreaking type. you seem to have won the first set a lot this year. how is that related to the confidence? obviously you had enough confidence to start with.
can you give us your impressions of the match today?
you had a breakpoint in the next game.
down 52 in the second set, did you change anything in your way of thinking or playing?
how did you feel after you won the second set?
if somebody who hasn't seen you play since you won wimbledon juniors, compared to today, how would you assess your progression since then?
you're going to be celebrating your third anniversary as a pro fairly soon here. what has been the hardest part for you to establish yourself as a professional player? what's the challenge ahead to become a regular fixture in the top 150 or top 100?
you played most of this year on clay. can you explain why, what it did for you, what positives you could take out of that.
you talked about the power in your legs. did you feel in the final couple of games, a lot of shots that came up short, was that a question of being tired?
tough at this level when you get a chance to play a masters 1000 compared to the other tournaments you're playing, the feeling that there's a good chance, money and points. hard to forget that kind of stuff?
can you explain what happened in the third set when you challenged the serve?
you're looking at this match in a positive manner, even though you lost it?
you've talked about sort of growing comfortable as you've continued on the tour here on the court. what about off the court, the daily travel, commitments, life as a pro tennis player. comes with a challenge. how do you overcome those sort of obstacles, maybe some loneliness, that sort of thing?
what is coming next for you?
yes.
you said you were training with some players here in the next few days. i've seen you practice with guys like seppi, for example. how much does it help you?
what was the game plan going in and how did it all work out?
you did hit a lot of good shots, a couple spectacular serves, returns, passing shots. just not enough? how tough was he?
you mentioned his serve. clocked in a couple times up to 209. was that something that was overwhelming?
he's been playing fairly well lately. he's a very solid player. what impressed you about his game?
where do you feel your game is right now?
you hit a 214. does that surprise you?
that's a pretty healthy serve.
probably 130.
you know your way around that ship now, don't you (indicating trophy)?
you rose to the challenge, didn't you?
the serving tonight at crucial moments was spoton.
you have won this tournament seven times. only halle and wimbledon you have won that many. how do you explain this place being such a special place?
did you always feel like you were pretty much in control i think psychologically and your game was also spoton?
yes.
can you talk a little bit about hitting the 9,000 aces? i think it's 9,012 now.
first match point today, seemed when you missed that forehand, it seemed like someone yelled something behind you. did that distract you? i think you doublefaulted.
you talked last night about being surprised that you were playing so well so quickly after a vacation.
i mean, is it because you feel much more rested or did you get a good training block in? is it just because it's dubai?
you have beaten novak now 20 times. he's beaten you 17. how do you describe this rivalry compared to the ones you have versus murray or rafa? how close is it in your eyes?
during the award ceremony, you and novak were having quite a long conversation. i'm just wondering what you were talking about and if you could tell us about that.
there were speeches going on. you were smiling. you guys were talking.
is it in your plan to do something in dubai like for after career like tennis academy, something like that? you have strong connections. there are people who love roger federer and roger loves dubai.
i guess he rose to the challenge you posed pretty well?
does his attacking game, number of volleys, did that puncture your rhythm a little bit?
is that kind of an example of it doesn't matter how much break points you have, but it's whether you have an opportunity on them?
when was the last time he served that well at crucial moments to you?
you obviously played andy a lot, rafa a lot, roger a lot. each rivalry is different. how do you describe the one with roger? what in particular makes it so close?
from your side, do you think there's anything you could have done better?
he says you're a lot different to play than the guy he's watched from the couch.
can you talk a little bit about, you know, the match and how you thought he played.
novak said that when he practices with borna he sees himself in him and he feels he's playing himself. did you see similarities between his game and novak's game?
borna was playing a lot today in the afternoon.
no, today before the match. he was training a lot.
did you practice today a lot before the match, or you were just resting and getting prepared?
you're through to your ninth dubai final in 13 tournaments since 2003. whoever you face in the final from here must give you confidence?
hard work, wasn't it?
when a match changes character so much as that one did, is it a bigger mental challenge?
this is going to be the fourth time you play roger here. what do you remember the first time you played here in 2007?
is it tougher because this is something of a home court advantage for him that he lives here or not at all? the crowd?
you took a slight fall.
what did you do to yourself to bring the trainer out?
during the match, how often do you look up to boris and notice his facial expressions? he gets really worried during the match. do you notice that?
when you have these weeks with boris, do you speak to marian at all?
when is he next are you going to
rather than boris or both of them?
do you think that was possibly a match you may well have won?
how did you turn it around after the first set?
you mentioned beijing. was it easy for you not to think about that match when you went down 6love?
when a match finishes as close as that, is it easier to accept a defeat or easier to...
are you nursing a leg injury at the moment or any other injury at the moment?
despite your defeat here, you're still on a very consistent run of form from the start of the year. that must give you confidence moving forward that eventually it's going to crack, you're going to win something eventually if you keep on this trend?
what can you say after that? the kid played incredibly well.
why do you think it happened that way?
in a match like that, how difficult is it to adjust in the middle of a situation where you know things aren't going quite right?
how much had you seen of him playing since that first time you played him? he's come on a lot since then.
roger said yesterday quicker courts give lesserknown players some help. would you agree?
when you went on court, how did you feel? did you feel normal or okay?
you're not a guy to sort of get videotaped and analyzed too much, but seeing as the same thing has happened pretty much two tournaments in a row, will you analyze them with amlie or...
it's obviously not like losing in a grand slam or even a 1000 tournament. what's been lost by this defeat for you? very much or not very much at all?
can you offer us any insight on what richard's problem was? we had no idea out there.
yeah.
you're obviously happy with the way you played?
next game is against coric, a man who has beaten nadal and gulbis and murray today. he sees himself very similar to djokovic on his game. what's your opinion of him in the next match?
when you play somebody brand new to you, do you sit down with severin and talk about what severin knows about him? do you formulate a game plan in that respect, or do you just say, it doesn't matter what the guy on the other side of the net is going to do. we're going to play this way?
photography, the noise in the court when you're in action, are you aware of it? does it ever distract you?
and today, like most of it was when you were serving.
that went nice and smoothly.
i know you know borna pretty well. what was your take? i don't know if you saw any of his match.
i remember seeing you play tomas in beijing last year, and it was one of your most emphatic performances. what is it about the matchup with you and tomas that brings the best out of you?
you have played all your matches here at night. does that differ hugely between day and night?
i know you normally, like a lot of the players, you keep the same tournament schedule, but this year you entered in doha as a first. how hard is it when you add in a new tournament?
well done. biggest win of your life?
but rafa wasn't well when you beat him. andy had just played a great match against sousa.
did you have a specific game plan going in today?
that 41shot rally very early.
was it hard to keep your focus? he started to make a lot of errors and everything. did you have a hard time...
there were problems yesterday in the match against baghdatis. what was it?
it's some changearound, isn't it? you lose in the last round of quallies and get to the semifinals.
does it feel more like you belong at this level now? are you getting used to it?
what's your relationship with nole? he was speaking yesterday a bit about...
you hit quite a lot with him in dubai during the...
on that court?
how do you feel you came here like lucky loser? what's the feeling now?
you've got the same agent as stan.
i see you've also got a quotation on your arm?
is that because stan did it?
what's it say?
what did your mom say?
there is a lot of expectations on you. nole has been speaking a lot about it, ivanisevic and cilic. do you feel there is a lot of expectations on you?
if you do play federer now, what will be your thoughts going into that match?
pity it had to go to three, wasn't it?
are you happy with your game overall, three sets a couple of times?
probably novak next?
one would think.
when you go out on court, having known that something that really wasn't anticipated happened right before you with andy losing and borna having a big win, does that give you pause? do you think about it? is that in your mind?
do you get a chance to watch other people's matches? did you see andy's match, for instance?
how difficult is it to focus when you're winning by a wide margin?
obviously the aim is to win. however, do you ever feel badly when you keep just beating up on a guy? he's had very little luck against you.
would you have preferred to have a little bit more match practice?
it was obviously a tough loss for sousa, but obviously in tennis is it important to learn to lose well?
you mentioned yesterday that compared to 12 months ago it's almost day and night in terms of belief about your body and everything out there. is that purely the back, or were there any other...
when it's a match like that and things are going smoothly, is it tempting to try out a few new things? are there actually areas of your game that you want to work on while you're here that might be slightly different?
the fact that there's going to be an extra week between the french and wimbledon, could that potentially alter things leading up to wimbledon?
comfortable?
must have been the belly dancing.
you have spent quite a lot of time with borna coric who is a kid that sort of bases his game a little bit on you. he plays andy in the next round. can he give andy problems?
is there a difference in your training routine on days when you're actually having a match and days in between?
you talk about working with coric. you play almost every alternate week. you lose a lot, too. how do you think that attitude towards defeat helps, i mean, to have a good attitude towards losing? because you play so much.
you.
tough afternoon's work?
you like a tough workout like that?
500 career match wins. only eight guys currently playing have reached that.
how does it feel?
can you talk a little bit about that point in the second set, at the end of the second set, 12th game where you lost that on the line call?
but how did you react mentally? did it get you down? was that the reason why did that charge you up for the final set?
you seemed to be disputing a hawkeye decision at one stage. do you find hawkeye sometimes doesn't get it right?
you will be playing stakhovsky tomorrow, another onehanded backhand. do you find yourself adapting your game when you're playing someone that's got a lot of slice?
just going back to the issue with the umpire, obviously he said replay the point. were you feeling that you should have been given the point, that it was your point, you had won the point, or what specifically was the issue in your mind?
in the beginning you went down love3, came back, took the set. what changed after that?
you got medical treatment at the end. is it the elbow thing that was bothering you before?
what's wrong with it?
coming from tunisia, how do you dream of becoming a tennis player? because you don't have a lot of history in tennis.
how is the game progressing in tunisia? is it improving or...
but your success, that has helped in any way in getting more players?
in the past, a talented tunisian player would normally go to france and start playing for france, or a number of them did that. how come you have stayed? you seem to have stayed at home.
you have quarterfinal points to defend here. is this a bit of a bigger disappointment? are you feeling any pressure about that?
despite the controversies in the past, the tunisian federation has asked you not to play certain tournaments. you still stuck with tunisia. is there any reason or are you happy to play for your country?
does it harm your prospects in any way, having the federation telling you not to play certain tournaments?
you didn't look entirely comfortable out there this evening.
do you feel sometimes when you go on court that players fear you, that they are already beaten before they go on?
over the last few days nadal has sort of been complaining. he says, i'm not the same player i am, i'm tired, my fitness is not good, you know...
do you think he's bluffing or do you have kind of a thought on his situation?
i don't know whether you are not feeling great. you sound a bit sort of croaky. have you found the conditions a bit challenging this year?
you could win your 50th career title here. are you a guy who focuses on these milestones? will you have a very special celebration?
you will also go one more than your coach.
you had to work a little bit for that one, didn't you?
how difficult is it to switch from indoors in rotterdam to here?
the weather was better again today. you have been practicing through sand storms and everything where i guess it must have been a bit slower. does it speed it up a little bit?
did that bad weather compromise your practice time, or did you get in as many hours as you wanted to get in?
i believe you have simone bolelli next. you lead head to head 32, but every set seems quite close. what do you make of that match?
i just want to know what motivates you to keep going? i mean, so many ups and downs in your career. what motivates you? what's your inspiration to keep going in your career?
how was that? what are your thoughts on that?
how many years did you spend with him in barcelona?
he is obviously determined to make it on the atp tour, which he doesn't come from a particularly renowned tennis country. do you think he's got a chance?
in the next round you may face andy murray. what are your thoughts on facing the third seed here?
can you talk about how popular tennis is in portugal?
are the facilities or infrastructures and in terms of coaching, all that improving?
if you drive around in the algarve, you see lots of tennis courts. is it a popular sport?
what's the main summer sport in portugal?
even not in the football season?
how important is it to have an icon to kind of inspire kids to play tennis?
how did you make the transformation?
you were down a break in the beginning. how did you turn things around?
did you know he's been going through a struggling period? he hasn't won a match this year yet? did that help you think, oh, this guy is pretty beatable?
how do you think you can help in sort of take tennis forward in uzbekistan?
what's going on?
in the beginning you went up 41 and then things changed. can you just talk about conditions and what changed for you in that match?
you're a very philosophical guy that thinks about other things other than tennis. is it something that worries you, keeps you awake at night?
no, no, that tennis isn't going too well at the moment.
when do you get the two weeks that you'd like?
where will you go to do that? back to latvia?
do you have an idea what needs to be changed, or...
you had six consecutive losses.
after the semis you lost the first round and then...(indiscernible).
i saw you just after you checked into the hotel and you said your bags had gone missing. when did they turn up, and were your racquets amongst the things that were missing?
you didn't have any racquets?
how difficult was that match?
how do you feel you're playing overall?
that beautiful backhand of yours, it was flowing a few times tonight.
how is the back?
i understand you're facing roberto bautista agut or dominic thiem next. what would either player...
you haven't lost to andreas seppi i believe since 2008. were you aware of that going in?
that was potentially a difficult match. he's had some good results here.
your decision not to play too carefully, was that related to the conditions here, the wind, or what happened in australia?
this is the first time there were fans in the upper grandstands since the beginning of the women's week. do you get full houses in first rounds everywhere you go, or is it special?
talking about playing on court 3, tomorrow you're on court 1.
i imagine there will be a big crowd for that.
when you have had a little bit more of an extended break than maybe you had planned on or hoped, when you get back there, do you feel like it's great to be here again? have you missed the actual matches?
davis cup, you mentioned just now, was it a difficult decision not to defend the title by playing the first round? what do you think the chances are of staying in the world group? will you play in september?
so just to be correct, you have now retired from davis cup?
congratulations on getting to the final game. seemed as if you were up to par with novak all throughout the game, but the last set something changed in there.
how brutal was the sun? obviously from that one side you guys kept getting broken; you were serving 94, 100, both of you. how difficult were those conditions from that one side?
you always said that you kind of felt you have a little advantage here because you trained here for several years and you're used to the conditions. today seemed like novak had a little bit of an advantage physically. is that because you're still not 100% back from your issues a year ago with the back surgery and all that?
it was much closer than in indian wells against him. did you get out of this match feeling maybe more hopeful for the next, or was it tough this time because it was so close and you thought it was a good time to beat him?
tough to go down a break so early in the third, but then sort of the killing one seemed to be that long game. i think five break points; you finally came through. what did that take out of you?
besides the weather factor, do you think especially in the tiebreak of the first set that you got a little distracted, out of concentration?
because you missed two easy forehands at net and one backhand in the net, and that also tiebreak make a difference at the end because of the whether condition also.
obviously there are commercial considerations with the timing and so on, but as you mentioned, brutal conditions. do you think it's right that two of the top players in the world should be made to play in intense heat when there is all day that could be chosen to play?
seems like the first set you were playing more aggressively; third set not so much. was it because of the physical conditions and the way you were feeling that contributed to that?
(no microphone.)
how difficult is it playing novak? he seems to have those kind of waves of energy where he'll dip down a bit and go up a bit. third set you were extremely fit, and he just seems to be getting stronger and stronger. is that something that's always in the back of your mind when you're playing a deciding set, that he just seems to push through in a way that other players can't?
for this particular winter, how much time did you spend here and how much time do you spend here on the these courts at this training center?
the issue that you're having against novak, what's the most challenging thing that he does?
congratulations.
talk about first of all obviously brutal conditions from one side of the court. you guys cut your serves like in half. all the breaks occurred there. what was it like out there?
earlier in the week you said about life is good. without jinxing you, is this another 2011 we're looking at right now.
nole, you made your second masters 1000 double two years in a row. seems like you're playing your best tennis. you're so confident against your top opponents, like nadal, federer, even andy, and you showed it today. do you feel like it's really nole time?
you are also the first player in history to have this double, indian wells miami, for the third time. do you keep track on those records, and what does it say on your domination and what do you feel regarding this?
as the third set was unfolding, did you have thoughts about what happened in melbourne with the fourth set going 6love as well?
i want to ask about at the end of the second set, that little towel grab and exchange where you got a warning. can you explain that?
you were you yelling in frustration?
do you ever feel like matches like this, when you know how much you have to fight to beat andy, do you ever just say, it's just not going to happen today? do you ever doubt yourself in your mind that it's going to happen?
is there something about andy, because you go back so far and you know probably how dangerous he is, that's kind of a mental trigger for you to fight through the fatigue barrier perhaps more than you might do against others?
can you talk a little bit about your fitness routine and how you've made that such a big weapon of your game and how you've really transformed that part of your game from your early career?
the other qualities you just mentioned, i guess they're a factor in that you've now won ten finals in a row, whereas before you had a period where you were struggling in finals. has boris been helpful in that? something that's come with maturity?
novak, one question about davis cup: will you play in july in buenos aires?
with your win today you have 22 masters, putting you just one behind federer. the more and more you start to pile on the accomplishments the more we hear your name in the greatest of alltime discussions. do you feel like you've done enough in your career that you feel like you belong in these discussions, or you feel like you have a long way to go?
just what were your thoughts on the match today?
your serve was very consistent. that was a step up, wasn't to it, servewise?
traditionally it's something that you were 56 against him today. he's been able to dictate in some of your previous matches. i guess this is an encouraging turnaround.
the final is going to be played at 1:00 in the afternoon, so it would be similar conditions. one assumes. how much of a benefit will that be for you seeing as you played all your matches this tournament in the early afternoon slot?
what happens tonight? you go back over to brickell and just chill out?
(no microphone.)
you might have answered the question before, but how do you see the french challenge in davis cup, and have you gotten a little closer to the french players since you have amlie on your side?
do you see grass as a good surface?
you got the two potential finalists are players very familiar with you; you're very familiar with. you've had big matches against the two lately. can you just way up the pair of them?
because of the fact that you know this court so well and the success you've had here over the years, do you approach a final over here any differently to anywhere else?
how difficult is the sun, cloudy sky, and the heat today?
was it maybe your best performance so far today?
talking to john, he said that he felt deflated a little bit after the tiebreaker. did you feel like that was the time to pounce?
how do you practice returning against somebody like that? how do you emulate somebody like him?
i came in a little bit late. the love30 game, early in the match, he had gotten out of a tough situation earlier and played a great game there. what was going through your mind?
this match seemed to demonstrate how much better your serve has become over the past year or so. it was a very good serving performance. something you've been working on diligently or just a good night?
you're in the final now; you have a day off; you're in miami. what do you do to prepare? go party? relax?
andy murray in the final; you've got such a good record against him. is that something that you feel is perhaps a positive or perhaps goes the other way because murray will be more determined to beat you?
quickly, he obviously reached 500 career wins this week. i know you're already into the 600 club, but what do you make of that?
novak, andy murray we all know is a great hard court player; you've beaten him i think nine times in a row. how proud of that are you, and does it even surprise you a little bit that kind of streak on this surface?
dimitrov, raonic, nishikori, all the guys broke down by john's big serve and great forehand. what do you think was the difference between you and the other guys?
you had never played him before. can you talk about how difficult it is to face him when he's playing that well and how you felt you played today.
just a little sum up of indian wells/miami. how do you feel you did in these two events?
when you're playing someone like milos raonic who is also a big sever you find your way into his serve. what makes it different with john isner?
do you feel more frustration playing somebody like isner because you can't maybe develop your game?
how much do you have to guess at where he's going with his serve?
is that the best anyone has ever served against you?
is that the most anyone has ever shut you down with a serve in a match?
what are you thinking when you go down a break in the second and a guy is serving like that? are you fighting the feeling that's it's hopeless, or are you telling yourself you can always get back in?
i think "clinical" is a word that comes to mind. could you analyze it or assess it?
seems to be the most really good wins you've strung together over a period of time.
how did you account for the consistency?
you just said the condition is perfect for you. could you explain a little bit more? because of the center court or because of wind or...
i think it was 44, love30, and then i think you ripped off 20 out of 22 points or something like that. when you get into a groove like that, can you explain it laypeople what that feels like?
today was your first encounter with kei.
did you find it's difficult for him to read your service like today?
i know that we and the fans like the narrative of the last american, the last american. does that enter your mind? does it give you any more motivation knowing that you are carrying the american flag for american men in this tournament?
one more thing: i was here the other night for the latenight match. how much confidence and energy did that match give you? there was a lot of energy and all the georgia fans were yelling and barking and all that stuff. did that motivate you going into this match?
i wanted to ask you, i think you had lost four straight matches going into indian wells.
what was your mindset going into that tournament, and why do you feel like you've been able to turn things around so quickly and dramatically for yourself?
let's say it's novak in the next round. you've had some good results against him and tough matches. what are your thoughts going into playing him?
in the middle of a match do you hear individual people screaming out? i can tell you, there were two by my broadcast booth that are like nails on a chalkboard.
did you pick the correct final 4?
what were your predictions?
first of all, congratulations on the stages that you reached. will you leave miami happy with what you accomplished?
maybe a turning point of the match was at the end of the second set or beginning of the third set. so looking back on those moments and points, which one do you think is the turning point of today's match?
you had tough matches and played two great sets of tennis. did you think you got tired a little bit in the third set, or not an issue at all?
is it going to give you more confidence for the weeks and months to come?
what is going to be your goal for this season?
and do you think these kind of losses help you to get your goal, to develop your game?
quick followup. do you think murray won because of the experience?
you came out and played really without fear. how aware were you that you were playing an opponent that yesterday reached a milestone of 500 career wins? and is murray a player that you look up to?
in this tournament where recently we see a lot of younger players coming up, like grigor, kokkinakis, and you  and nishikori just got in top 4  so do you think this is a time for you guys, the younger generation, to take over these top players?
well done, andy. was it quite satisfying to turn it round to the extent where you were so dominant at the end having struggled early on?
do you have a little glitch in your shoulder?
moving forward, berdych or monaco. thoughts on both of those guys?
did you expect the game to be as tough as it was going into it?
was it your patience? experience? you're a little bit older than him. you think that got you through the three sets?
does he remind you of anyone?
is there a bit of roddick in there?
what did you think about juan monaco or tomas berdych?
if it is tomas, will thoughts of melbourne come into your mind, or is that way over and past now?
three matches; you only lost 10 games so far. can you comment on that?
from last year where you played also very well until the injury in the semifinals, how can you compare the level? are you much better this year?
i suppose you like miami; you live in florida. what do you do off the court? anything that's different here in miami?
you have been playing?
your impressions on the game?
andy, 500 wins. how big of an accomplishment is that for you?
within the media and fans, these kind of masters tournaments are celebrated. does that mean that much to the players? do they pay attention to those sort of milestones as much as people think they do?
could you talk about your next match and your next opponent.
what can you tell to all the fans who support you every match that you play here in miami?
are you as much of a cake fan as your mother is, judging by her twitter feed?
do you think your team might...
there were like two matches in the same one today. what happened until 41 in second set, and how did it turn?
just a bad day? nothing hurting?
next week you will be at 141 consecutive weeks at no.1 in the world, tying rafa for six most of all time. first of all, do you pay attention to those milestones, and what does it mean to you?
are you at all concerned about some of these houdini escapes? because all three matches there have been some fiddly situations that you have had to get out of. i mean, as you also were asked about on court, nine lives and things like that, is it concerning at all to you?
when you lost the game to fall behind 54 in the first set, broke your racquet, walking off the court, the crowd cheers, arms raised up. i wasn't able to translate that gesture. what were you saying to the crowd in that moment? did it make it harder for you? did you get even more upset. you seemed to play better after that.
when you're a little bit tired from playing so much past couple of weeks, you see roger is not here and rafa is out, does that make it more or less difficult to become motivated to go out there and play?
what specifically did you do to regain your composure? because you were getting frustrated, emotional, all that stuff. is there something specific that you tell yourself at that moment, or how do you calm yourself out?
you were always kind of fiery. is this something you have had to overcome? do you think novak of years ago would have lost this match today?
like two veterans coming up against one another in the next round with david. what are your thoughts about playing ferrer?
yeah.
you have been around long enough.
meant in the nicest way.
second match at 11:00 in the morning, a second very good match. do you like playing early?
what do you feel you could still improve?
obviously last year you had the great run to the semifinals. you had to pull out. can you describe what that was like for you emotionally to have to stop playing because of an injury? what kind of impact does it have on your motivation this year to go forward?
so last night nadal talked about being nervous lately sometimes during certain points of the match, and you're known for being a fighter, for being great at coming back, even if you lose a first set. how do you deal with those situations? you're so good at it. do you ever get nervous or does that kind of motivate you when you're at first losing?
the other thing i wanted to ask you was about ichiro, if i'm saying it right.
he's 41; you're only 25. he plays now for the miami marlins here, baseball. have you followed him at all? have you followed him growing up? i have heard in japan you're as big as he is now. what's that like for you? talk about him and who you like as a fan.
this tournament, what improvements would you like to see at this tournament compared to other masters events, if any?
i was told you were on the cover of time magazine in asia. what was that like for you? was it exciting? fun to see yourself?
did you expect it to be as tough of a game as it was?
there seems to be some frustration rising in the second set. can you talk us through the internal talk that was going on?
you have an extra difficult game where you have to use an extra spin of your game. so given the fact that you have to play some extra games  nadal now is out, which gives you maybe an extra motivation. how do you feel? do you feel extra motivated for the rest of the tournament?
yesterday rafa, who's always very honest and forthright, was telling us that he actually feels some selfdoubt for the first time in his career. that he gets nervous on points and anxious, and it's something he's never experienced before. have you ever had moments like that during matches or any stretch of your career? how did you get through that?
the itf is looking for ideas to shortening the games. next year there will be a tiebreak in the fifth set in davis cup. what do you think of the idea? would you like to see that happening in all the grand slams than just the us open?
for example?
alex dolgopolov next round. you had some comfortable results against him and you've also had some tight matches against him. what are your thoughts going into this one?
what would be a better format for davis cup and what kind of feelings can players really have on this?
after the second set, what was going through your mind? because you had played well the first set, and then you lost two breaks in a row. you were broken twice to lose the second set.
considering the place and the opponent, how do you rank the importance of this victory?
so when you enter a match playing a top player like rafa, do you do anything different mentally to prepare yourself going into that kind of match?
one of the things that rafa mentioned at his press conference was that he's not playing with as much freedom or he feels like nervous since he's come back. this is like the 15th time that you've played. did you sense from your part that something was different from your past experiences with him?
it seemed you found a way in the second set, and then it totally went away in the third. what was the sensation today? how can you explain how it went?
do you feel that you haven't been able to build up much momentum this season?
you obviously had quite a few issues last year. i think your wrist, your back, and the appendicitis. i'm just wondering if you're finding it as easy to trust your body perhaps after those problems last year.
is it an issue maybe trusting your body this year after all the physical problems last year?
i think it's very interesting you're talking about nerves and selfcontrol. i mean, you seem like you have won so many big matches in your career that you always seem to have that confidence and that swagger about you. why do you think this has happened? when did you start feeling that way?
have you ever felt this kind of nervousness or lack of selfconfidence before in your career?
as this is a problem in your head, if you like, have you thought about consulting a sports psychologist? many top golfers say the sports psychologists were very, very important in recapturing their game and getting over these problems. are you thinking about doing that?
with the clay season coming up now, are you looking forward to that as an opportunity for you turning your season around, hopefully getting some confidence going into the last stretch of the season?
i will repeat the question. with the clay season coming up, do you feel like now with the clay season coming up do you feel it's an opportunity for you to
with the clay court, the clay season, barcelona, madrid, french open, clay court season coming up, do you feel it's a chance for you to get your confidence back and play better and hopefully turn around your season?
how did you feel for this first match? you must be very satisfied, but how did you approach the match? how did you feel?
seemed like you were content to have long rallies. i think even the first point of the match was 10, 12 shots. was that part of the game plan today?
you have an aggressive play style and always go for your shots. how do you strategize for defensive players on the tour? how do you deal with that?
how were the conditions today on court? were they like indian wells?
how does the ankle feel?
with the weather outside right now, there are like 50milesanhour winds. were you happy you were able to get the match in and get out of here before the storm?
you won almost all of the big points, like the break points off of your serve and his serve. were you aware of that and happy with that?
the conditions here are so different than the conditions in indian wells. what do you prefer?
(indiscernible.)
you like playing him, don't you?
how punishing was it heatwise?
is it fair to say you're possibly more familiar with the conditions out there than you are in wimbledon centre court conditions?
i would like to know if you're driving a peugeot diesel. every time you start losing the first two games with nadal, today with berdych. when it was raining, we came back, you lose your serve. against murray in miami you saved a breakpoint in the first game and lose the serve in the third.
do you think the kind of bad sensations today could be a result of the match yesterday against nadal? when you win despite not playing your best, is it even better for your confidence?
how does it feel to win everything like that? how long do you think you can keep this winning streak?
thinking about you won the masters, all that you won this year, if you close your eyes, you don't want to see a yellow ball for how long?
you became the first man to win the first three masters of the season. it was your 23rd title. you broke federer's record. are you a man of statistics? does it matter to you to break new barriers all the time or...
obviously wherever you go you are one of the fans' favorite. in today's match, the people started to root for tomas at one point. how do you feel when they start cheering not against you but for your opponent?
you said you weren't playing that well today. then there was the rain delay. how do you keep yourself focused to come back and close the match?
i know usually guys you don't like to compare seasons, differences. you're breaking every record. how far do you feel from your level this year from the amazing 2011?
we're all going to compare what you're doing right now with 2011. do you feel it's the same state of mind? can it help you?
it is a defeat, but is not a terrible defeat.
do you think the game at 3all in the first set was kind of a turning point because you started very well. this game was super long, amazing.
just looking at the numbers of this match, i notice that he played 12 winning forehands, and you just six.
yes, novak. on the unforced errors with the forehand, you made 14 and he made nine. i want to know if you had the feeling that your forehand was today a little more problem than other times or not?
how do you explain the drop in intensity? the fact that you are not used to playing big games since the beginning of the season?
don't you think that the change of racquet at this stage of the season affected your game at all?
i'm asking you.
compared to last year's french open final, do you think novak has changed a little bit his way of playing on clay, or was it the same player you faced last year?
how much would you be surprised if tomorrow berdych is going to beat djokovic?
but for you.
you said yourself in the beginning that novak is winning pretty much every match at the moment. he's won the only grand slam, all the masters, on his way to another here. is it possible for one player to win all the masters and all the slams in one season?
do you think it's possible in this season?
will you be 100% for paris, 100% fit?
are you satisfied the way you played? were you worried when you were down 2love in the first set thinking that he was again back, the best nadal, or not?
most players facing nadal try to avoid his forehand like hell. you didn't. does that say much about your confidence right now?
considering you are a perfectionist, is there something you're not happy about today's game?
unlike you, rafa hasn't had a great year. his game started to pick up here. he beat ferrer. were you surprised by the level of play? there were some points that reminded me of roland garros when you guys were so intense. were you surprised by his level?
nadal congratulated you. what would you say to him? maybe you said it already to him on the court at the end of the match.
rafa is the king of clay. do you feel the hierarchy is beginning to change, even on this surface?
during the second set at 3all, you made a wonderful smile. was it a smile of question or a smile of surprise?
can you talk about berdych and the perspective of winning the second title here in montecarlo.
you won the australian open. you're on your way to a third masters this season. has the thought crossed your mind of you winning all of them, all 13, in one season?
with tomas you are 11 on clay. is it different with him on this surface?
you must be happy with your year until now. every time finals or semifinals. only one quarterfinal.
yes.
what do you think you improved the most this season?
do you think you are more hungry in a way than maybe the last two years?
is it the biggest challenge for you to be able to reach that high level also on clay?
why do you like to play gal so much?
are you surprised you make it so easy against such a good player? gal is a fighter, but he cannot fight against you.
if someone would say that the ones they are playing now could be an anticipated final (referring to djokovic and rafa), would you get angry at anybody saying something like that? you lost 36 times out of 42 versus nadal and djokovic. does it make you angry and more motivated to do something tomorrow, strategy, plan?
i'm asking you.
looking at the numbers, we have to say that it sounds like an anticipated final, but you never know in tennis. you won six times versus those two.
on clay especially.
between the two, if you had to play nadal or djokovic, they play differently, and you won twice with djokovic and four times with nadal, does it make any difference?
if it's nadal, do you think your victory against him in melbourne could help you?
today everything worked very well. but what are you most satisfied about?
what would it mean for you to be able to hold the trophy tomorrow? another masters 1000 here in montecarlo.
if it is djokovic tomorrow, do you think that's the toughest challenge in tennis at the moment?
speaking about 10 years ago, your first masters 1000 victory, what are the things you're most happy about in your progress since then?
he's my boss.
it seemed to me the moments you were struggling on the court, you had troubles with your forehand. maybe there was a lack of depth.
you had troubles being deep with the forehand. do you agree?
the moments you were struggling on the court were because you had troubles with your forehand. do you agree?
another strong win. how do you feel?
it was a kind of match you were looking for to get more confidence?
tomorrow you have to play djokovic. maybe at the beginning of the tournament you were not too confident on your chances. what now? has something changed after today? do you know he lost five games in the first, four in the second, three in the third.
facing djokovic in the semifinals here is also a sign that you're back with the best. i would like to know if facing your main rivals ahead of major tournaments is something you like or do you prefer to avoid them before taking them on at the majors?
i'm sorry to move to a completely different subject. martina hingis will play singles in fed cup after 17 years of not playing singles. i would like to know if you think anything about it, what your reaction is to that.
it will be the 43rd time you play against djokovic tomorrow. at this point is there still something you can change in your game or guess in his game, or do you know everything there is to know?
the first set was kind of unusual, then he came back in the second. were you expecting him to somehow play better in the second set?
before the tournament you talked about the quick turnaround between miami and here. do you feel the momentum is helping you now, looking at stan and roger who didn't play too well after taking quite a long break?
(question regarding facing nadal or ferrer tomorrow.)
they say moto gp riders or formula one riders, when they become a father, they drive slower than usual. it wouldn't be your case.
they say they lose a second with each son they have. it wouldn't be your case. i'd like to know how you cope with your child and sleep and so on.
considering all the amount of time you already spent on court this year, do you think, whatever the result you achieve here, the period between tomorrow or sunday, within your next tournament, will be a crucial one regarding your objectives at the french open?
your groundstrokes are very powerful; you're serving very well. how important is it to have this type of game here on this surface?
i suppose you have some kind of mixed feelings today, maybe being a bit disappointed not being able to play more this morning?
are you happy with your level this week?
you have yet to drop a set in the tournament. you lead the tournament in points won on your first serve. are you focusing more on your serve during practice?
a few minutes ago monfils said that he likes the way you play tennis, because you play flat, very fluent, but he doesn't like when you play him. he says he's in trouble. he doesn't know exactly what to do when he has to play against you. even if he beat you in roland garros, everywhere else apparently you cause him trouble and problems. do you know why? can you explain tactically what happens, why your game gives him trouble?
it's beautiful to watch you play, but not beautiful to play.
he likes to watch you but not to play you.
he's not asking your advices.
it's the first tournament on clay. did you expect to be at that high level already so soon in the season?
have you watched part of gal's matches this week? how do you see this battle against him?
how do you prepare for match like this against gal, especially on clay, tactically? what will you be your key? what will you do?
i know it's very difficult to win a masters series. it's 10 years now since you won your maiden title. how do you explain that you often struggle before the last hurdle in major events?
at this time of the year it's a new season in terms of surface, but also in terms of outfits on the court. how much involved are you in the choice of your outfits?
are you 100% or is there something wrong with you?
what bothers you the most, the score or the fact you didn't play well?
maybe you were paying for the lack of confidence you had recently?
is that kind of loss worrying for the rest of this clay court season?
can you describe the exact feeling when you were on the court.
maybe your serve was not too bad today.
how do you feel now? you want to do something totally different, forget about tennis?
was it similar to the match against simon?
you were happy to be in montecarlo, saying you were starting to feel better, so what happened?
magnus was not with you at this tournament. do you believe this was a factor?
when you feel like today, do you realize that as soon as you wake up in the morning or once you're on the court?
does the doubles match comfort you?
when you're like this, you just don't even want to see your racquet anymore?
something totally different. hingis has decided to play fed cup. it was a long time since she's done that, 1998. what do you think about it?
talking about the olympics, hingis asked roger to play with her, then she asked you. what is the situation?
but can you explain?
are you going to go home tonight?
are you hoping you can win the title in doubles here?
yesterday you said it was probably the best win of the season. is this one even better?
is there anything in your game you're especially satisfied with after this match?
playing on the baseline is something you have to make an effort to do because you prefer being further back or it depends on the confidence level?
the improvement in the key points, is it just that before maybe you were thinking too much and now you just play?
you just said you are satisfied. if i ask you to rate yourself today from 1 to 10, what would you choose?
if it was gilles simon?
rafa, does it feel like the new racquet can be the turnaround of your season?
the weather has been cold a little bit. does it affect your play? does it change the way the court plays?
i guess you must be very, very disappointed being up 53 in the tiebreaker, two chances. what happened?
throughout the first set especially, it seemed you were not exactly loosened up, you were uncomfortable, especially when sliding, moving. do you agree? is that true?
gal said yesterday in press that sometimes you play very patiently, sometimes you play less patiently. is it very difficult to play patiently against gal? is it a frustrating game to play?
does this loss change your plans for the rest of the clay court season?
you came here after a threeweek break. you had some time off. are you happy with the way you worked and spent these three weeks?
if you were a promoter in rome, do you think it would be better for them that you do very well in istanbul and madrid or very bad?
i know.
did you see gal improve a lot during the past years? before you used to beat him more easily. now it's becoming more and more difficult.
given the information you learned today during the match, what do you need to do that you didn't do?
what disappointed you most, the fact that you were up and couldn't win those sets or...
you practiced with /th*epl in switzerland. are you going to choose now to play in switzerland?
(question regarding the nba.)
how can you explain what happened today? is it because of gal?
was it a bit weird on the court against stan, who was missing a lot?
is this week the best tennis you've played since a while?
i saw you playing very well yesterday against fognini and today even better, or is it just two different opponents with different games?
it's a long time since you haven't beaten a top 30 player, since toronto last year. is it a new click or new start?
looking at your earlier successes, i would say that your grass court game is your greatest strength, then hard court. you seem to be improving all the time on the clay. would you agree with that? which surface do you enjoy playing on mostly?
if you have to choose where to play the match of your life, which surface would you pick?
because could be the final of wimbledon?
rafa is playing with a different racquet. what about your new racquet? in rotterdam it looks like you were playing with a different racquet.
he's using a different one with more open strings. it's not like yours. you were playing with a different model in rotterdam.
is that the final of the season?
how do you see the next match against gal?
what is the toughest against him? is it that you can't really guess what he's going to do?
is it patience that you need the most when you have to play a guy like monfils?
a difficult opening opponent being on clay. how do you think you played?
you're playing doubles, as well. did you choose to do that just to get more confidence on the surface here?
was it a good start for the season today?
you were saying you didn't play well in practice. did you have no expectations for this tournament?
you played extremely well last year on clay, here in particular where you won the title. do you feel pressure that you have to defend your title here?
what makes you more confident in your game on clay?
it's difficult to know how much mental strength influences your game, but do you need to feel good mentally to be able to play your game?
is it easier for you to go from hard courts to clay than the opposite?
you were wishing for a good match today. you had it, right?
you were not serving well in miami. how did you serve today?
you seemed very calm, very focused.
he discussed the point for a very long time.
he was always trying to play his backhand, which is his best shot.
what did you think about his changes in mood? he managed to break a racquet.
do you joke about this in the locker room?
nobody's happy to play against david ferrer. how do you feel before the next match?
you said court no.2 was okay. was it the same today?
what stopped you from playing your game? was it him or was it you not feeling good today?
at the start it seemed more balanced. what changed after that?
how do you feel after this match? do you feel that it's something left unfinished?
can you describe more precisely how different his balls are compared to other players. when you're on the other side of the net, how does it feel?
with today's win you are 273 against a guy who is born in the '90s. all your losses against guys born in the '90s came in the last six months.
have you changed your racquet or the strings recently?
why did you change the racquet?
do you think it is more difficult today for players who are 19, 20, 21, to break through on clay especially than when you were that age, when you and novak and andy and others were that age? is it more difficult today?
i wonder because maybe on clay it is harder to win points. players now seem to be more physical, quicker, stronger. does that make it more difficult for young players to break through?
there is no reason why someone who is 19 or 20...
you were very solid today. how much confidence does it give you, a match like today?
you may have to play john isner tomorrow. what do you remember of the match you played in roland garros when you were down two sets to one? also is this surface better for you because it's less quick probably than roland garros?
can you give us your verdict on the match today.
i want to ask you generally about which surface you like playing on the best. i don't mean which surface you have the best results on necessarily. if i just said to you, you can go and play a match this afternoon, for you to enjoy, what would you choose?
do you play back matches or situations in your mind while you're in the middle of a match? in the second set when he broke you back, did you recall rome last year at all?
if he wins, you might have to play monfils. will that be a revenge after lille?
but you do like to play against him?
you seem to be very calm and composed.
you played very aggressive. it's no problem for you to do that on clay, too.
so that's the goal, whatever player you have to play, dolgopolov or gal? you intend to be very aggressive?
if you win next round, you will have 200 victories on clay. does that figure mean something to you?
the classic question. it's your first match on clay. was it easier because he had a wild card?
how are you physically? do you feel the efforts are adding up?
are you particularly afraid about possible injuries?
you said you had seven days of complete rest. what does 'complete' mean?
but that's rare.
you're now the no.1 french player. were you upset that you had to play on court no.2?
now that you are no.1, do you feel any changes?
you don't feel any particular pressure?
many players now reach the best level at 30 years old. it's like they have a second youth.
can you say a word about your opponent today, mr. balleret.
nadal seems to say that he feels a lot of pressure when he plays. are you surprised by that?
but isn't it strange that a player with that experience can come on the court and suddenly doesn't know what he has to do anymore and is a bit lost?
can you talk about your next opponent, benoit paire.
but how come you play always bad matches with him? his game gives you trouble?
how tall are you? in the media guide they say you are 1 meter 85.
you beat fognini a few months ago.
what do you remember of him and that match? also today four times you were broken.
that against nadal can be a problem. is it normal that you lose a lot of times your serve or it's an exception?
that is more difficult.
what do you think of your level of game in this match? that were ups and downs, of course.
isn't it the sliding that is most difficult to a adjust to on clay?
do you enjoy playing on this surface or does it take a lot of effort for you?
how is your shoulder?
what was the problem?
can you describe where you are right now in your career. it seems you've been constructing it very carefully. you practiced with the top players. you're going to play nadal tomorrow. you have knowledge of that high level of play.
you never practiced with nadal, did you?
are you going to try to hit with a lefty tonight?
how did you feel today to be back here on this court?
what happened at 32 in the second set? you were both waiting quite a long time.
how did you cope with the birth of your child? did it change your routine?
if you win here in montecarlo, i believe you'll be the first to have won three backtoback masters at the start of the year. you've overtaken rafa for the number of weeks at no.1. how important are these to you? are you aware of them? do they inspire you? is it completely irrelevant?
your french has improved a lot this past year. is it something that came naturally by living here or do you have a very good teacher?
you're also very good in italian. it's easy for you to grasp.
edoardo artaldi i know takes care of your business.
when you do things with peugeot, for instance, do you follow up to see what they're doing? now they produce a game which is very complicated that you can participate if you want to win two tickets at roland garros.
how many years?
you haven't played against nadal since quite a long time. he's one of your biggest rivals. do you kind of miss it?
you've been doing well in the masters lately. are you satisfied?
were you disappointed you were not in the main draw?
so you're just happy playing matches?
it was a good shot on match point.
you played many futures and other tournaments. are you happy now playing the masters?
playing the futures and challengers, did it help you to take it easier now?
but was it difficult? the atmosphere is different in those tournaments.
so you're not taking any painkillers anymore?
if you were told in melbourne that you would be playing this tournament, being top 75 again, would you have signed up for it?
but you would have liked a wild card for australia?
about your forehand, how are you hitting it now compared with 2012 and 2013?
do you believe you're stronger mentally now?
you knew patrice dominguez well. how are you affected by the news?
looks like you're going to play a pretty full season on clay this year.
what was the difference between today and last week? i know, obviously a different opponent.
apparently the clay here is similar to the french open.
can you tell us which are the technical adjustments you make when you make the transition from hard courts to clay courts.
it doesn't look like you at all on the court at the moment.
what is the reason, in your opinion?
someone who is searching for his game and complaining.
is better if it comes from you.
how do you fix it?
is it strange or is it normal or is it easy to face?
do you feel like it's the place?
last year you had a huge breakout on clay, semifinals at roland garros. do you think you will try to build on clay good results to get back from this bad period?
will you focus on clay?
thomas enqvist didn't get through the second round here, as well. what did he tell you before the match?
what did he tell you?
can you tell us a bit more about your new coaching setup, how you work with thomas, and how it can affect your early results this season.
is it wrong to think maybe you're struggling with your forehand, especially since past months, and can you explain a bit why?
it's not like it's getting better.
you know the situation. how do you gain the confidence back?
after today's defeat how are you feeling? how do you leave madrid?
when you were thinking before, what were you thinking about? just about the positive things, right?
did you think you were going to come back on the any moment in the match?
we still have rome ahead, but i wanted to ask you if you have pressure because of the expectations at roland garros? do you still think there is a lot of time left?
at the beginning of the tournament you said that you were going to leave the top 5. you're leaving top 5. you step down to the 7th position. how does that affect you for roland garros?
you said that you're happy with this tournament. years before when you lost the final you didn't say that. is it difficult for you to lower your expectations? is it difficult to assume that you have other expectations now?
what do you think about being out of the top 5 for the first time in a decade and so close to the seeding before the french open?
how much was today's result about andy playing great and how much about you not playing your best?
is it tough for you to understand how you can go from playing so well against berdych yesterday to this difficult start of the match?
you say you want to forget this match and focus on the positives. is that easy to do in reality?
do you remember last year roland garros, the semi against murray? he's becoming a better playing on clay, but that was another story?
usually you don't beat rafa on clay. what happened today? you had won in madrid before.
you haven't lost since you got married. did you have to be a happily married man to beat rafa on clay, and do you think you can continue in the clay court season?
after so many years of trying, just how good does it feel where you're sitting right now sitting as champion over rafa?
as you said, you played rafa so many times on clay. what did you think about his game today? do you feel it was the usual rafa on clay, or did you see that something was maybe missing compared to the other years?
how much of an affect as amlie had on your clay game, because it's improved drastic clay to, say, 12 months ago?
rafa has won nine french opens. do you still consider him as the favorite there?
apparently you were looking at the atp website while the video presentation was going on. what were you looking at?
how much do you attribute munich to this win? obviously it's a lower event, but it's the first time you've been to a clay court event and left without actually losing. i imagine in a sport where you lose most weeks, must feel different. and also just about the stats, you won 81% of your second serves against rafa today. i guess that must be near personal best for you.
sorry about the loss today. how would you assess your performance?
couple late night matches this week. how has that affected you? do you think it affected your performance today?
despite the loss today, you've got a very good record in spain. do you like playing on the spanish courts?
which are your feelings for the clay season, the rest of the clay season?
when you play andy, do you identify any differences in how he may conduct himself compared to the last time you played him?
obviously this time last year you had the back injury. speaking of injuries, you've obviously had much less injuries this year. what's been the difference for you?
which is the difference between competing in barcelona and here in madrid? what do you have to do to adapt your tennis to play here?
at the beginning berdych was winning some rallies then you came around. how did you see the match?
in barcelona you said that your forehand against fognini was not vulgar. what do you think about it now?
i want to ask you how much did you need a victory like this and how much do you need tomorrow's victory? how much do you need a championship like here in madrid?
rafa, could you talk a little bit about your two possible opponents tomorrow? nishikori had a great week in barcelona, and andy murray, also his first title on clay. tell us a little bit about both of them.
during the whole week you only lost your serve on two occasions. today you only lost ten points on your serve. do you think that the great part of your confidence during the last matches is due to your serve, that you're doing with better with the serve?
can we say that between grigor dimitrov and berdych today, who was more tough to win?
you said everything about your forehand. i want to ask you about your backhand, perhaps those things that you might want to improve. perhaps the parallel backhand?
last year we saw you in madrid celebrating the 10th champions league of real madrid. how do you see yourself this year in roland garros? talk about roland garros.
today real madrid is playing at 8:00. are you going to see it or is it not a good idea because you have an important match tomorrow?
are you going to go?
can we talk a little bit about your old racquet? do you think you're doing better here because you're playing with your old racquet?
on today's match, in the australian open you lost in straight sets to tomas berdych. what has changed fundamentally, apart from returning to clay? how would you compare your game now versus january?
you sounded pretty devastated in barcelona, especially in the press conference. you were a bit harsh on yourself. my question is you made it to the final, so regardless whether you win tomorrow, are you happy with what you achieved here so far and, can you finally move on from what happened in barcelona?
could i just have a word from you on potential final opponent andy murray. you've played him many times on clay over on the years. how much do you think he's improved? how improved is he on clay today than the first time you played him?
is there a sense of relief to see that your forehand is back to its best level? were you doubting that maybe it would come back at some point?
last time you faced kei nishikori you lost in straight sets at the world tour finals. did you do anything different today in order to beat him?
we hear the players talk a lot here about the difference playing at altitude on clay and the difference between rome and roland garros. is that something that suits your game given you've traditionally done better on faster courts, or is that a general sign of your improvement on clay?
today you were dictating the game throughout match and your backhand down the line is very good. is there any moment you feel pressure or uncomfortable during the match?
you've been moving really far forward to return serve, particularly to like the ad backhand side; almost on the service line at times. firstly, when did you decide on that? seems since miami maybe. also what was the thinking i guess behind it?
what do you have to do tomorrow versus rafa? rafa is a great player on clay. second question, why was it important to preparing the clay season in barcelona and not playing monaco and barcelona?
you've been moving pretty well today. does that mean that you've recovered totally from the 3:00 a.m. match of the other day, or you think it could have an impact tomorrow?
you've played rafa on clay many times and had some very good chances to beat him. have you ever gone into a match with him playing this well on clay and feeling this confident on the surface?
you're playing really aggressively today, not just on the backhand return, but generally speaking really aggressive play. was that a tactic specific to playing kei or something you're generally trying to do and will do against rafa tomorrow?
looking ahead to tomorrow's final, obviously because of where we are, you're not just playing rafa nadal, you'll be playing the crowd. how tough can that be for and you how will you prepare yourself for it?
yesterday you were saying that today's match was a test. have you passed it, and how would you grade it?
yesterday you were saying that this test was different to the two previous matches. this one was a little bit more complicated. do you think it was less complicated than you were expecting?
at your first press conference we were asking about the favorite playing to win the tournament. you did not include yourself. after today's match do you see yourself more as a favorite?
what has changed from barcelona? what do you expect tomorrow?
how do you feel mentally? today you managed to recover in the second set. emotionally how do you feel?
(no microphone.)
yesterday you said that today was a test. can you grade it?
apart from the support of the people, technically does madrid have something that's good for you? do you feel comfortable on this court? does it have any special feature that suits you?
you've been serving really well today: four aces, a couple serves above 200 kilometers per hour.
do you think this is important for you? have you changed something in your serve?
just talk us through the match a bit and whether you think this was your best match on the european clay this season.
grigor dimitrov, people still call him young, and they called him young yesterday.
young. they asked you if his generation will overtake yours. the reality is they're only a few years younger than you.
but nishikori is only a couple years younger than djokovic, for example. do you think their achievements are sometimes overrated compared to yours?
you mentioned in your first answer about your goals and that you met another one today. what were your goals for this week and have you met them?
you received a time warning. maybe it was not the best timing, right? did it disturb you?
yeah.
how tricky is it to play against an opponent that visibly has some fitness issue? is it playing with your mind too at some point?
also noticed you moving quite a lot on the court. you looked quite confident. did you feel more at ease? did you feel confident?
you played a few amazing points under pressure today, especially that lob in the second set. i think it was on the break point as well. are you happy with your performance in those moments?
you faced a big server today. is it frustrating playing players like karlovic, isner, raonic who have the huge serves?
can i just have a word from you on each of your two potential semifinal opponents.
there was a moment where a ball got called out and then you corrected it and it was in. do you feel that was something you should see more of on the tour?
great match, but one second you're not winning here in madrid. was it because of ferrer? how did you see yourself out there? it was a really good match.
you had played two more matches than david. do you think that you were a little bit more tired than him?
as you were saying, it was really good tennis out there. we've seen you playing really good tennis in the days before. what are your shortterm goals?
apart from today's result, which of course you're sad about it, what is your feeling? how do you leave madrid? do you think you're feeling better? playing better? hopefully you will do good in rome and roland garros. i guess you're satisfied with what you did this week.
do you see yourself very far away from the level that you would like to have?
congratulations on the victory.
how do you feel it went out there?
you served really well today. didn't face a break point until the very last game and didn't get broken. is that a shot that you are still working on, still improving?
obviously you went to a deciding set yesterday, and looking at statistics, your decidingset record is one of the best of alltime. what do you feel is the secret to your success in deciding sets?
how well do you think this tournament reflects the shape in which players get to the french open? what are your expectations for the french open?
rafa, do you have an allround match against simone today. years ago djokovic lost against dimitrov and decided not to come this year. i want to know your opinion about that, and what do you expect from dimitrov in the quarterfinals?
yesterday you were saying that you had to celebrate. today you have more reasons to celebrate. are you satisfied?
two matches, and you served really well in both of them. is that important to continue for the tournament?
you've already said that in madrid you're not at 100%. talking about rome, do you think you'll be in the highest level there in order to go to roland garros in your best shape? do you think that after madrid you're going to go to rome in your best shape?
during all the season you've had up and downs. you've had very good moments and also bad moments. do you think that you're back on the right track? you think you'll be regular again, especially in clay court, or you still have something...
i don't know if you saw yesterday's match, federer and kyrgios, but does it surprise you? do you think that now we're going to change the generation of players?
are you training with grigor? after today's match he said that you're always the favorite, especially on clay and here in madrid. tomorrow you'll have all the people behind you supporting you. is there something that could worry you about his game?
yesterday when you were leaving you said that one of the things that you wanted to do is to be able to see the football match. i guess that you also wanted to relax. did you manage to make it to the football match? what did you think about the match if you watched it?
you were saying that you're looking at small things to be happy about and not such big goals. how can you say that a player like you, with such good goals and big goals achieved in his career, you need to work on it? now you're saying that you're looking at the small things. is that new for you?
this season in rio you were set to go on court in a really late match. yesterday murray and kohlschreiber went on court after 1:00 a.m. do you think that's something that needs to change?
just talk me through the match today and look ahead to dimitrov tomorrow.
how important is it for you to play good in front of the home audience, and what does it mean to gain more confidence before roland garros?
and the self confidence? what does it mean in front of roland garros to gain more?
david, good match. how do you see verdasco? normally you beat him in madrid. talk about everything.
next round quarterfinals you'll play nishikori or bautista. which do you prefer?
are you a bit tired? perhaps too many tournaments in a row? yesterday you finished late. what do you think about the schedule and timing?
i just wanted to know, after these two hard matches, how do you feel physically? you are playing ferrer next.
with garcialopez you played on the central court. today you played on court no.3. is there a lot of difference between the courts? do you prefer the central court, a bigger court?
yesterday's match and today's, both of them you started losing and today you just came back. people are very happy with these matches.
today you have beaten the champion of the us open. is this one of your best victories of the season?
right now you were just saying that you were adapted to the courts here in madrid. do you think that that's going to make tomorrow's match against ferrer more tight?
you were talking about the way that you won these two last matches. how do you feel about tomorrow's match? physically better? mentally?
tomorrow you're playing ferrer, which is not maybe grand slam winner. five years ago you had your big victory against him. are you thinking about that when you face a match like tomorrow?
how has it been to meet all the people in madrid?
how do you feel? how is your tennis?
last year there was also a couple of losses against almagro. you don't have the obligation to win ten montecarlos or whatever. are you having fun?
you've had an easy match; you served very well. also, you were very happy when you scored many of the points. does that mean you were nervous or just wanted to do well here in front of your people?
today you did the fastest atp match. do you think in this tournament you're going to finish your matches fast?
we are talking about juan margets, that he wants to go the to presidency for itf. he has a proposal for davis cup. he wants to play the matches to five sets. what's your opinion about that?
how have you seen nishikori in barcelona?
were you surprised about anything in particular of his game? second question is, if we suppose both of you are going to make it to the final, are you thinking of that?
i wanted to ask you how did you see yesterday the match of real madrid? are you going to be able to see them here? what's your feeling about that?
are you going to go?
could you just talk me through the match today and your assessment of how you feel you played?
sorry if the question has already been asked, now that you have switched back to your old racquet, it seems like you have found your rhythm. tell us what made you go for a new racquet ahead of the clay court season?
you've been at the highest level for an incredible amount of time. i was looking at some figures that surprised me. it's 11 years that you've been winning a major atp clay court tournament before going to roland garros. hopefully of course you aim for one victory here. how do you find after all this time your physical condition and how do you find your hunger for winning?
how different has this year been for you? in the past you've had injuries, but things have clicked quite quickly when you started. obviously you found success quite quickly. now you've had to be patient and understand things will take their time. is there this a different sensation for you?
you told us in wimbledon that federer was your big childhood hero. how was it to play against him for the first time and to win?
what is it about the big stage that brings out the best of you? great result at wimbledon and now here.
people talk about you playing like you have nothing to lose. in the third set deep in the tiebreak, is that how it feels?
when i spoke to you yesterday you said federer was in your eyes the greatest of all time. with that in mind, how does this rank against your win against nadal last year at wimbledon?
roger said in his press conference that he struggled to return your first serve today. do you feel that was a key in your victory?
he said he struggled with your first serve. would you say that was your main weapon today?
after last week and this win, i guess your confidence on clay is going up now.
you're kind of a showman out there. today you handed a ball to one of the ball girls. how do you keep so calm and not nervous on the big stages?
i want to ask you about john isner next. going to be expecting more tiebreaks?
you mentioned about the future of the australian tennis. do you feel with yourself and thanasi and groth that australian tennis could perhaps reach a high point after many years low since hewitt's peak?
will you play in rome next week?
it seems at the beginning it was a little bit tough; then you managed to recover. talk about his game. were you surprised?
normally you play in the central court. today there were a lot of players playing. they told you to play during the night and you didn't want to?
how do you feel on that court? is there a lot of difference?
sorry for your loss there. just like to ask you, i spoke to stan last night about the state of the courts. were you having any problems with the courts?
probably not the result you were expecting. what happened today?
if i'm not totally wrong, it was your first meeting.
how was it to play against him?
were you not surprised by his play on the big points? he played some amazing points, especially in the tiebreak. were you not surprised by that given his age?
if you had one regret in this match, would it be the break that you lost at the start of the second set when you maybe had a handle on this match?
at 2love.
what did you mean when you said, we need a clown in the circus. what did you mean exactly?
kyrgios skyrocketed to fame after he defeated nadal at wimbledon last year. seemed like you have also noticed his talent much before that. you invited him for training. do you find any similarity with kyrgios at this age and how were? by 19 you managed to be in the top 30, and kyrgios also managed to do that, like in the last month when he was 19. so do you find any similarity between how you were?
(indiscernible.) do you find any similarities from today's match and last year's?
what are they?
(indiscernible.)
are you going to rome next week?
i would like to know how do you face the next match against cilic?
i would like to know how did you feel during the match? in the first set you were down.
how do you feel in this tournament? how do you rank it against roland garros? what are your expectations in this tournament?
you're a veteran on the circuit. i don't know in which moment you find yourself. maybe you have some up and downs. what are you lacking to get that regularity that you need, that consistency?
i would like to know what were your first thoughts when you went out there on the central court? how did you settle yourself? what do you expect here in madrid?
we have been talking about the possibility of playing the finals to five sets. rafa nadal said that's fine. david said he didn't like it so much. what do you think about playing finals to five sets?
the other day we asked rafa if when djokovic is not here does the draw open a little bit. he said that he was not the favorite for the tournament. how do you see rafa?
i wanted to know if you're satisfied with today's match? you came back in the third set. did you feel like you should have closed it out in two sets?
i would like to know your version of what happened with carlos? can you elaborate?
you say that the rules should be the same for everybody. is that a vision that many players have? have you talked about that with the atp?
i know you were in quito in attitude and it was a really great tournament. and now here in madrid. how did you adapt to altitude in two days?
very well done. were you pleased both with the performance and with the result?
he had points, two points i think to get back to 5all, and then he had three points to go to one set all. were you particularly pleased with the way you played those points?
how important was this win for your confidence ahead of the australian open?
he didn't lose his serve coming into the final, and then you break him right away. talk a little bit about that and how you handled his serve.
are you going to auckland for the tournament?
are you happy with your new coach?
what was your assessment of that? how do you feel now going to the australian open?
the rest of the week nobody's been able to make a dent on your serve. obviously he broke you right out of the starting gate tonight and four times. was it something that wasn't working with the serve tonight? something he was doing?
how tough is he? he just never goes away. i mean, that's like one of his big things?
with all the fitness you have been doing and the matches you got here, is this the best prepared you feel going into the australian open?
after the three sets yesterday, three tiebreaks for david, and he obviously looks tired after that, and you talked yesterday also about your fitness coach and how he worked with you towards being so ready for the competitions and others to come. how did you miss this opportunity of david being a bit tired from yesterday for today's final?
what's your schedule next week? you're playing adelaide?
how difficult was it to maintain concentration against a guy who was serving so well for all that time?
no service breaks in the match. it was a pretty tight and tense match. what was it like being in the match?
how do you maintain concentration, knowing that one shot can perhaps cost you the match? do you have to think in a certain kind of way? how do you do it?
of all the big servers you have played against, where do you rate ivo? how good is his serve?
you're going to play your first final here in doha. are there a few things you need to change in your game? how will you prepare this final?
you are playing very, very well. do you have any explanation about that? is vallverdu giving you something new? did you do something special? because you are playing...
(question about spelling.)
from where?
(off microphone.)
can you talk about how you're feeling this week, your matches played? (off microphone.)
what went right for you tonight?
what makes david such a tough opponent?
very well done, ivo. you handled both the world's best player and the conditions very well.
why do you say you were luckier? because the way you broke serve near the end was with an amazing forehand running pass. you played pretty well, didn't you?
did you feel he was getting frustrated at some stage?
did that help you to see him like that?
do you feel that you're playing better now than you were, say, four or five years ago? your ranking is higher and your serving is even better than before.
you had a 73% firstserve percentage overall, and in the third set 85%. that's pretty impressive for a guy who has a big serve, but it can be erratic at times, i guess, because it's so big.
how difficult was it out there? did you feel like there was sand swirling or just wind?
and david ferrer next. your thoughts?
did novak say anything to you at the end?
how hard were the conditions out there today with the sandstorm, the wind?
you kept to your usual steady performance. he offered you 41 unforced errors, as well. how much of a help was that?
you might face either djokovic or karlovic. is there something that you can change in the way you play if you either play nole or karlovic?
was it surprising a little bit with the weather conditions and everything? he was able to serve at such a high and consistent level through that match?
what do you take out of the week over and above everything else? is it the match practice you had?
what's your program next week? is it melbourne park the whole time?
can you just go through that seventh game in the third set, like why the break and stuff, what happened there?
from a tournament like this, going to australian open is completely another story, five sets, another place. what's in your mind?
is the fever gone? do you feel fit now?
pretty straightforward except for i'd say that seventh game maybe in the second set where you dropped your serve?
how tough is it to play somebody who's a good friend who you kind of know and grew up with?
dustin brown i think tomorrow.
talk a little bit about that.
if you can, just a little bit on rafa's situation going into the australian, obviously not a good day for him.
so you feel he's recovered from the appendectomy, the operation?
the appendix. do you feel he's all recovered?
what did you make of your day? two wins on the same day on the serbian christmas?
i understand there are so many things to do during a tournament, and, you know, a lot of pressure for the singles. but people like so much doubles. you don't think is the case to push the atp to organize yourself? because some of yours, big names, play more in doubles during the tournament? because there are so much people likes that.
in the singles, he nearly broke back in the middle of the first set, and after that, after you survived that, you seemed to get better and better. did your rhythm build up and were you pleased with the way you improved?
what was it, a case of getting used to the pace of the court and the conditions or what?
is there anything you can say about what happened to rafa? is there anything you can say about playing him in the doubles? is that something you look forward to?
how do you feel about playing the man who's hit 9,000 aces?
besides two match wins, did you get other christmas presents? anything you can tell us about or how you celebrated maybe before you came here?
do you enjoy playing against karlovic, or is it something like a challenge or you hate that?
you looked okay in the first set. did your physical or mental condition change after that? what happened?
losing a match in the first tournament of the season may not be a disaster, but do you feel confident that you can pick up quite quickly from this, or do you have a feeling how long it will take?
just your game, your general game.
i realize you're still in doubles here. but once you get to australia, would you consider playing maybe an exhibition match at kooyong or a wildcard in sydney if you happen to lose earlier here in doubles than you anticipated?
you have a history in the past of coming off a season where you have had injuries and whatever even stronger than you had been before that. are you confident that you can do the same after the 2014 season?
how hard will it be for you to go to australia, knowing you don't have enough matches and may be a little rusty and not have expectations possibly of winning and thinking you can lose early? is that difficult for you going into a grand slam, mentally, to accept?
what do you make of that performance?
at what stage did you really think you were certainly going to be able to play?
is it too soon to know how your body has recovered from this first competitive match?
can you say something about how much proud you are to be no.1 of the world, what it means exactly to be no.1 in a sport like tennis, which is really very, very big? and the feeling you are when you see your child, you cannot say to him that daddy is no.1?
to go back to the game, it was very quick. you finished like in 58, 59 minutes. you had some difficulties in the first set. was it due to the weather conditions? because it was a little bit humid, windy over there.
as somebody who normally doesn't play this week of the year, how do you expect or hope that this will help you heading into the australian open, which is obviously a big goal?
if you could possibly like put on a fan's hat, can you kind of understand it seems like fans are most fascinated with how rafa is going to do at the australian, knowing that you ended the year really strongly and roger had a really strong year last year, but, you know, rafa again coming off a year with serious injuries but has proven in the past that he has done really incredibly well after that. can you kind of comprehend that fascination of fans with rafa?
very well done. was that the most difficult match to close out the whole of your career?
i think you said on court that the mental aspect of the game had sometimes been difficult for you. do you feel that today you have conquered that aspect?
what were the other good things that came together that you just mentioned?
how satisfying was that for you to start the new season in that way?
specifically with your new coaching setup, what things have you been working on?
can you address a little bit why you felt it was time for a change in coaches and choosing dani as your coach?
could you please talk about your next game? you might play either monaco or kavcic.
if i can ask you a question about rafa, we have seen him injured quite a bit through his career and everything, and a lot of people think, oh, well, he will never come back, and then he often comes back out of that even stronger than he was. how do you assess him as a strong competitor and looking ahead to the australian open? does he look like he's, you know, underplayed or can you never count him out?
what did ivan lendl tell you about dani? what was his words for dani?
well done, richard. are you happy to have played a good match and won well?
starting a new year well means the whole year may go better for you than last year?
fitness okay now?
is it hard to come into the first tournament of the year with any kind of firm expectations? it's like, you know, not that long ago, but still you haven't played for a while matches.
just talk a little bit about you were serving for the match and dropped that game and then obviously came back real quickly. is that kind of a factor of the start of the season, maybe a little rusty here and there?
you came to the net quite a bit, richard, and you did well when you came to the net. is that something you're adding to your game?
can you describe how it feels, you know, standing there with the plate for the loser of the final and the audience starts cheering with you and never stops. they shared their love with you knowing how you feel. can you describe it?
i think everyone would agree with stan when he said he played the game of his life. do you think you allowed him to settle a bit in the second set? were you a little bit tentative?
you broke your racquet at the end of the second set. were the emotions very tough to handle, the pressure? is it only a question of tennis today?
you fought a lot. do you think you had the sort of negative attitude? a little bit of followup to the previous question, because, okay, you were just one set all. i mean, you hadn't lost yet, but you were more nervous than you should normally be, i think. even if i understand. and also, when you saved many break points, attacking, didn't you have the feeling on the net that you could have attacked a little more, or was impossible?
how much physical or emotional energy do you think your previous two matches took out of you? with nadal there was so much talk about that almost being the final, you two playing in the quarters, but you had two more matches to go. how tough was it to come back with...
how much did the prospect or the reward of what was at the end of the match for you potentially, how much did that prey on your mind during the match, and how do you think you can overcome wanting so much?
you have been a part of a lot of great matches in your career, but how great do you feel like stan played today? for you to come out and play your best after i think you had played two back to back days, was that tough for you?
how would you describe stan's backhand and how it was today?
given you took out rafa in the quarters and i think most people thought this was your time, does this loss hurt any more than the others?
each time you lost here in the final you bounced back immediately in wimbledon. do you think it will be tougher this time, or is there something of a routine which can move on pretty quickly?
can you just comment a bit about the end of the match? obviously he thought he had hit an ace and it was over, and then there was like five points. how strange is that when that happens?
i know you don't want to talk about wimbledon, but will you use this defeat as motivation or will you try to forget about it as soon as possible?
andy, it was an amazing comeback into this match. do you think that at the end, maybe start of the fifth, that's why it played to the end, or...
what was the sequence of events last night when the referee came on? did you want to carry on? i don't know, what was said out there?
you had the crowd really going last night, and then it was obviously a different atmosphere to come out today. were you consciously trying to get the crowd going early on? we saw you fist pumping early. was that something you were conscious of?
i suppose moving on from that, do you think there was any advantage to be gained by either you or novak from going off last night?
second time this year now that you have obviously lost to novak in a slam. where do you assess you are in comparison to him now? do you think you're getting closer?
there was a period last night when you got the crowd going and you really seemed to have novak on the back foot. can you take more positives from this defeat than any of the previous seven against novak?
do you think the games authorities need to look at a rule whereby a player can just walk off court for nearly eight minutes in the middle after the match?
he has a lot of amazing qualities, novak, but do you think his ability to mentally regroup when he is under pressure is one of his strengths?
how would you assess the first six months of the year for you? it's obviously been pretty good.
you beat a record coming into the press conference, first one. what did you expect? what were you thinking this morning when you were to start playing this match which had been interrupted? do you think you were a little bit lucky last night because of the interruption or not?
when you lost the fourth set today did you feel you needed to do anything different? what went through your mind?
do you think having to play today is going to impact tomorrow? what will be the keys against stan?
what was it you were having done to you when you went off last night? do you think it's fair to stop the match for eight minutes, which is pretty much how long it took? what was being done?
how did it feel the direction of the crowd yesterday and today? was that disturbing some moments or...
just to clarify from the earlier question, what was your treatment? and in the eight games that you have beaten andy since wimbledon, was the toughest he's run you?
you have a chance to equalize roger federer in roland garros number of slams.
and second, there were 32 break points in this match; you saved 17. i mean, how do you explain it? surprise in a way because you both served well, but then you gave so many chances on your serve, too.
obviously the last two matches now you are managing to hold your serve. you only got broken once. how solid do you feel? how confident do you feel going into the final?
last year you lost in the first round. when did you start to believe it is possible for you to reach the final at roland garros and to play well here?
stan, you won the junior title here 12 years ago. do you remember at all how you felt before the final, after the final?
you were talking about handling things differently this year. how has that changed for you guys mentally coming into a tournament knowing that you're not always going to play your best tennis? what have you and magnus done to really make sure that you bring your mental game?
novak is two sets up. assuming he does win and make the final. you said when you played him in melbourne it was a strange match. what did you learn from that match, and how do you feel about facing him in the final here?
to follow up, last six times you played djokovic, four times you went to the fifth set. on clay, if you had to choose the surface where to play versus djokovic, would you pick clay?
you were up one set, one break, and then in english you said maybe it was due to pressure. was it due to pressure or was it due to the heat? because you asked for the physician to come, the doctor to come. or was it both things?
well, it was a very tight match. would you say that the difference here is that you won a grand slam and he didn't? i have the impression that you're full of certainty during your matches. you know where the key is. that is, the key is if you can play your game, you're going to win. is it not the biggest change for you during the tournament?
what about the crowd's attitude? they were whistling when you waved to the crowd. many people were shocked, former players and current players like jo. he said, that's not cool, because people were shouting against you. how did you experience this? what do you think about this?
(off microphone.)
if it's djokovic for the finals, would you say that the rallies will be different? because it's not on hard surface but on clay, would you say this is going to have an impact on the game?
what about this thing, to be reaching finals at roland garros? is it a boy's dream?
now, what about the physical injuries you had during the second set? is this something serious or not? you were holding your thighs. no problem?
i have the impression that this year nobody can beat novak. he's a machine. what are you going to do about this?
when you won the australian open you were saying, oh, this is a bit bizarre; what's happening to me? you didn't really understand. do you have the impression this is where you deserve to be, this final?
after a tough start of the match, you really came back into this first set. do you think this one was the key, or did you feel throughout the match it was tough today?
for sure you didn't celebrate your birthday the way you wanted, but did you expect this morning that the match could go like that? did you feel fine and in great shape, or were you doubtful about yourself?
if not today, if not djokovic, some other player some other year, someone would have ended your dominance here at roland garros. the fact that you lost to djokovic who is the best player right now, does that ease your pain? is it better than losing to a lesserknown player?
obviously this is only the second time you have lost here. are you able to deal with this defeat the same way you would deal with any other defeat, or is it a little bit different because it's here?
you said you were not happy with the third set, the way you played. thinking about it now, is there any reason you can find as to why the set got away from you so quickly, the third set?
there is an extra week before wimbledon this year. you are also finished earlier than you usually are when you play until sunday. what are you thinking in terms of looking on to the grass season and how to improve on results from the last few years?
what are you thinking in terms of your prospects for improving on your grass court results from the last few years?
in terms of novak's level compared to the rest of the field, where do you see him compared to everyone else? is it hard when you win a match like this for novak to follow it up, to go back into the semifinals and have to win two more matches?
i hope this defeat won't ruin your birthday. i would like to know what are you going to do now? will you stay in paris?
your history and great dynasty come to an end; you are the greatest to play here. do you think this defeat is the turning point of your dynasty? do you think that you will come back to win next season here?
would you say that the first set was a key set? you started 04 and then 4all and then 45. that's when there were a few break points and you managed to come back. then you had a very difficult game.
last year when you won here you were totally exhausted when you had to go to wimbledon.
(off microphone.)
during the match i think there was this discussion as to whether we have to sprinkle a little water on the court or not. could you say also a few words about the warning you had on time.
well, when we were watching at your match we saw that you had a number of opportunities. would you say you're satisfied even though you lost?
what do you think about this loss in your career? you couldn't win for the 10th time.
you have been defeated on the court where you had won before, and the crowd put their hands together for you quite loudly. would you say that when they were applauding they were perhaps showing some type of recognition of who you are?
back to the match. were you surprised given the number of dropshots he played and the number of times he volleyed at the net?
you had some tough matches in the past against david. what made the difference today compared to the other times?
there was about a 40 minute gap between your first match point and the one where you actually did it. were you annoyed with yourself? were you just trying to refocus? it was there for you, wasn't it, at that point?
(off microphone.)
now you've beaten a player you've never beaten on clay before. does that cement in your mind you are better on clay this year? there is actually empirical proof that you are getting better on clay.
how easy was it to ignore what was going on with rafa and novak and just briefly look ahead to facing novak?
did you find yourself looking up at the scoreboard more often than you normally would to check what was going on in the other match?
kind of felt like it might have been a crossroads match for novak and rafa; time will tell. can you reflect on what that means for those two guys going forward?
it wasn't the fiveset marathon you were kind of maybe hoping for. not going to be any kind of physical aftereffects. but do you think psychologically maybe it might be difficult for novak to sort of go again now after coming through such a big test? is that something you could capitalize on maybe?
what will be the keys, in your opinion, compared to other times you have played novak in this season?
i can't remember you, or pretty much anybody else, ever being called for hindrance before. has that ever happened to you? did it have any bearing on the sort of next 10, 15 minutes of the match?
we are supposed to get some heat finally on friday, quite serious heat, over 30 degrees. that going to affect anything? is that something you can obviously take in your stride with your preparation in miami and everything?
given novak's form at the moment, is there anything you can do in the next 48 hours that can really make you go on to court, thinking, yes, this time i can beat him, and put yourself in the best possible mental frame?
do you visualize yourself beating him so you have these images in your mind, or is it not as simple as that?
the end of the third set, how were you? did you feel confident? were you tired?
you have beaten him four times and four on clay. what was the difference today?
how much do you think andy has improved? from the other side of the net, what was his level like today? good enough to beat novak, for example, or not quite?
after winning the third set, then you lost the thread of the match. what has changed? why have you lost the match?
do you think you gave your all today? you did your best compared with last year?
allow me to put this question to you: rafa said that he will be back at roland garros with a desire to win, and i think that you will be eager to win again. it is said that spanish tennis is over. there are lots of rumors about the end of spanish tennis.
what are you going to do? do you know your schedule?
who is the favorite to win the title? who would you like to win? do you think that andy has the abilities and skills to hurt novak?
how do you assess this tournament?
i guess you went through many emotions through this match that you have dominated from start to finish. can you walk us through what you felt gamewise, emotionwise?
did you surprise with result, like three sets?
how much confidence do you take from this win today into your next match? how much, if at all, would it loom in the back of your mind that you have overcome this hurdle that you've tried to for so many years and now wanting to follow that up?
you know, journalists are bad boys. they asked you, what happened when you lost those four games? what were you thinking in that moment? what went through your mind? you say, oh, i'm in trouble even if this is not probably the best nadal, and i am stronger than him?
i don't know if you've realized, but the last three times you have played rafa here the match ended in a double fault. how strange is that? why is it happening like that?
what was the key factor in your opinion? was it mentally here to climb the mountain, fighting against history, or tactically knowing that you're dominating with your forehand much more than he did, which is normally his weapon?
it's officially murray next. he won. he's undefeated on clay this year. you're undefeated on clay this year. can you talk about him, the match, and also about what he's improved? you haven't played him on clay this year, but what he's done to make that improvement on clay this year.
at some point in the match today, you seemed, it seemed, you weren't happy with the condition of the court. can you explain what was going on?
at the press conference of nadal today, he said you're in the best state of your career. how do you think of that?
wondered if you could reflect on what you think this means for nadal and if this a match that might be a crossroads in his career. you know, you have played him more than anyone else. what are your thoughts on that?
i'd like to know what kind of satisfaction you're feeling in this moment, and on court and if you had some tears in your eyes and they are different from the tears you had in montecarlo.
tears?
there's a stat out there that it's the first time that roger hasn't managed to have a break of serve at a grand slam match since 2002. so considering how windy it was out there, how particularly pleased are you with your serve?
roger said that he felt clay was going to be your chance of a first slam, and australia came along. do you have that view, that clay was always going to be a really good chance for you?
can you look ahead to your match with jo? he just finished. i think you did that on purpose.
i think you did that on purpose because you walked in as soon as he finished. can you just talk about that match?
will it be like a davis cup atmosphere? will that help you? will it just help focus everything? you know what the crowd is going to be doing, don't you?
about the crowd, i mean, today you faced the whole crowd against you, as usual when you have to play federer. tsonga, federer, different thing? similar? different because he's french?
what about these semis? is this taste a new taste for you after what happened last year in the and in the past six months?
you said this was your best match for a grand slam on clay. this is what you said on the courts. could you tell me more about these shots? they were always within the lines. secondly, you said it's impressive the weight you put in the points, but your chopped returns, what about these? very impressive. was that the key?
i had the impression that you need to have ups and downs in your season so that you come back stronger and stronger.
yes, this is what i meant. but, you know, you fall and then you don't play well, and then all of a sudden you're back. even though when you practice you practice hard and you play well. but maybe, you know, this is it. you want to kick your own butt.
(off microphone.)
we are talking about the big 4, and this is something you said a year ago to us. you said, they are always good; whereas you have the ups and downs. we asked the question to roger, rafa, novak, and the three of them said, that's because stan has won the australian open. he's digesting it. it's happened to us before. they said, don't worry. he's in the club. he's one of us. is that something you felt? i can remember the three of them really said the same thing unanimously.
how good a display was that by stan? have you seen him play better in a slam?
how tough was it to play with this wind today?
at one point you were trying to hit the ball really high. were you trying to slow down the game?
were you feeling comfortable with your game on this court, or were you maybe lacking your timing, you usual timing, because of the conditions? because you didn't really look like you could at some point take the lead on to it.
is it difficult if you play a guy, a friend, you know, that you know so well? you have beat him 16 times. still today you feel that something is missing in your game or is it difficult, as well?
that 3all point in the tiebreaker, it looked like you wanted to replay it and the umpire gave the point to stan. can you talk about the difficulty of making that call? and also, serena williams and azarenka had a similar situation. they talked about having some kind of a replay for close calls like that. do you have any thoughts on that?
i know perhaps it may be a bit too early to look ahead, but do you head into the grass court season with the thought that wimbledon is your best chance of winning another grand slam title?
even if you say that you lost for a combination of facts, do you think return mostly was your weak point today, together with his serve? because you didn't have any break point in the second and the third. do you think that is one of the reasons, maybe you were returning a little short or something?
how disappointing is this loss? it's a quarterfinal match, after all.
yes.
i don't know if this is the right time, but could you tell us more about novak and the match?
will you watch this match?
what did you think? what was it like playing the topspin of rafa and being out there against him?
how would you put into words sort of what his game is like, facing it? what's it feel like, that ball?
how do you sort of sum up this experience this past 10 days here in france? and as your clay season is now to an end, how do you feel about it sort of overall?
excuse me, singles.
during the match there was a moment that you were down but you reacted like a real champion. what was the key moment? because you were a little tired and suddenly came back.
you played every day now since tuesday, and obviously you will play tomorrow, which is great. but do you question the wisdom of doing both singles and doubles in a slam like this?
how do you feel about rafa and novak djokovic? whom do you pick?
you were dialoguing with yourself, talking to yourself a bit out there. the serve seemed to be a factor. was that critical for you? if you had a little better percentage on the first serve it might've made a difference?
do you come out of this tournament or from the match today feeling any different about sort of your stock as a player?
would you say that rafa's second serve is his weakest weapon in his arsenal?
i think you won a couple points in a row with dropshots. maybe not too many opponents have done that against nadal. what parts of that match do you think you might treasure and you were proudest of and when you think you played your best?
how concerned did you get in the course of that match, second set and early third?
the last time you played david on clay was three years ago here. how different of a player are you from that time on this surface?
after all the rain and everything yesterday, was there a bit of an issue with the back of the court at the end in front of where your team was sitting?
gal sometime ago he lost against roger and he said he wants to be more like the top players who seem never get ill, no sickness, no flu. do you think it's a discipline question, the reason why maybe you'll get less sick than other players? do you do something more careful?
less sick, like no flu or something? because you get more careful on when you get out with more coats or anything?
you played two very aggressive players who hit a lot of winners, but also give you a few unforced errors. how difficult or how much of a challenge will it be now to play ferrer, who is almost the opposite? he's more consistent, maybe slightly more resilient?
17 straight quarterfinals or better at the grand slams. i'm just wondering, that's obviously a terrific record. i'm just wondering how much sort of pleasure that gives you, that sort of unshowy consistency sort of compared to perhaps more the headlinegrabbing titles that you have won like wimbledon, us open?
34?
how much did you enjoy that with the crowd and everything? they were getting quite into it at some point.
slightly off topic, you tweeted a tennis coach the other day an apology for your language after he criticized you, he was showing some young kids. you said that was your failings, trying to be a role model. is that something you think about a lot? is that something you really want to try and improve upon?
although roger is ranked second, there hasn't been a lot of focus on him in this tournament, your streak and novak and nadal. do you think at his age that he's legitimately someone that could make it to the final weekend here?
you have lost the match. it's a tough blow.
in the first set, maybe you could have hurt him.
why can't you keep with him?
the start of the match, the third game, i mean, was it a sort of turning point?
do you think that he's better than the previous years? playing against nadal, is he the favorite?
maybe this is the best player you have ever faced?
i'm talking about this match.
do you feel like watching the match? why do you want to watch this match?
since estoril, lots of nice things have happened. what about the future?
the first three games were long, but after you started dominating, how is your interpretation of the situation?
richard said for him it was tennis made perfect. do you feel right now you're at your best physical shape before this big match with rafa?
rafa said it was going to be the toughest quarterfinal he's ever had here, but not a final. he emphasized that. i'm wondering how you're approaching this. you played him five or six times here without success. does this feel different?
you have completely recovered from what happened during your last match, or...
somebody extra is coming for this quarterfinal. costarica or somebody of your world? you are happy still in paris?
you made an interesting answer on the latest press conference on tennis in the balkans. i asked the question to goran ivanisevic as well and ivan ljubicic, and they told me, it is in our gene. we are arrogant. we think we can beat anyone. what do you think of that and do you recognize it in yourself?
do you think it makes it psychologically easier that you have played him a lot and you will play him again? how do you approach it as a quarterfinal? you have to give a lot more after that to win the title if you get through.
do you think the pressure is more on you because rafa has won so many times here and you haven't? do you think the pressure is more on you and that could be a danger for you?
well, are you frustrated or proud after the match?
now, when people play against these players at that level, the difficulty is to win games and sets constantly, consistently? is that what's the most complex thing?
did you feel today that you could do it?
your serves were probably not as efficient as they were during the first rounds, first three rounds, and you made double mistakes on your serves. how come?
you said that you felt there was a moment when murray panicked a little. is it the beginning of the third set when you broke him immediately and then afterwards your serve game was not that good?
well, by the way, when you broke him, how come you didn't play well afterwards? you had double errors, etcetera.
however, did you enjoy this moment when you were really with the crowd?
how far do you think murray's going to go? how deep? a possible winner, would you say?
tactically, what was your plan to try and fight back against murray?
you reached quarterfinals in australia, your ranking was good. and then your ranking went down for different reasons. what's the key for you? to use this roland garros as a springboard? for you to go up constantly in the rankings rather than doing ups and downs all the time?
what have you got up for the rest of the season? what do you think your prospects are of going unbeaten for the rest of the year?
can you talk a little bit about winning your third shanghai title and also the match today against jo.
we notice that you always wear red shirts in china. do you think the chinese red brings good luck to you?
marian said you're pushing your opponents to try to do things they cannot do to beat you. does that also feel like this on the court, that whatever they are going to try, you can find an answer?
i know you say it's often difficult to compare years. but i wonder if you might think this year, in terms of the quality of your tennis, in terms of what you've done in the grand slams, in terms of the quality of the tournaments you've won, do you think this is turning out to be an even greater year than 2011 for you?
you learned a lot in writing and speaking this year. are you going to try to learn more?
yes.
jo said a few times he had nothing to do, nothing to say, because you're just unbeatable right now. let's assume if you are the opponent of novak djokovic, if you have to play against novak djokovic, what are you going to try to try to get a win?
you say this is the best year of your life. also the only thing i can think that didn't go your way was the french open final. looking ahead to next year, i'm sure you want to win every tournament you play in, but is that a major goal next year? is there any temptation to change the way you prepare for that at all?
you're in great shape now. in every tournament you are the favorite to win the title. few people doubted you would win. do you enjoy the status you have or are you waiting for a true rivalry?
you've talked a couple of times, a few times this week, about how your family members have basically focused their lives to make your life happen. is that sometimes something you feel is a burden?
this year you started the season in doha. do you know how you're going to start it next year?
you're going to doha?
next week your atp points will reach over 16,000. you make another history. what do you think about this? do you worry about next year your points will go down?
it seemed from the second set to the middle of the third that you had found a good rhythm against him, maybe were more solid than him. why do you think you lost this one?
what is your next plan of the season?
of this season, yes.
in the third set it really looked like the match could go either way. you looked really disappointed when you got broken at 65. were you disappointed at the moment?
yes, yes.
final in beijing and a semifinal in shanghai. is that much better than what you expected when you came to china?
you talked a lot this week about confidence, the mental aspect. were there some points in the third set where that started to go away, where you felt the confidence slipping in tight moments, or was that there all the time?
you mentioned you lost very many close matches this season. do you think today is one of them?
i guess that just wasn't your night, was it?
is there any rhyme or reason why that can happen just 24 hours after playing so well?
do you think also the serve issue could be the fact that you know how good djokovic is returning, that it puts extra pressure on your serve, or it has nothing to do with it?
you played him a lot of times. he seemed ultraaggressive tonight, not only attacking your serve, but he was getting into the net at every opportunity, wasn't he?
you were stepping into the baseline by quite a margin on some returning points. does it have anything to do with federer's new tactics or did you want to be aggressive purely?
i know you want to win the first set in any match you play. do you go out there knowing you haven't beaten him after losing the first set, do you go out there thinking that you need to get the first set this time?
it seems you had many combinations of serves today. tell us about it.
you had quite many combination of serves today. could you tell us about it.
we all like to talk about rivalries and headtoheads. is it all mattering to you that with novak's rivalry you're having with him when you're entering the court or not at all?
did you feel a little bit desperate on the court because novak acted like a machine, like he can't get anywhere?
that seemed like a pretty satisfying performance. your take on it?
were you at all surprised how much you were able to kind of keep him out of it, except the first game in the second set?
you and jo have a twopart rivalry. at the start you had issues playing against him. it has completely changed since 2010. do you see some special reasons in your game that you have adjusted more to his?
tsonga is an exciting player. he even dived today in order to win over nadal. any expectations about the final?
today you wrote down chinese characters. it's complex in chinese. you did very well. my question is, how many chinese characters do you know?
what stands out about your selections?
i know you're still very focused after each match. when we watch this match against andy or others, it's insane, too good. have you been sitting after matches this season thinking that was just amazing or are you just focused on the next match?
off subject. the other day you talked about keeping your son's privacy. boba's son had been kidnapped. did that go through your mind?
how was the match?
did you feel the effects of last night's late finish? do you feel the schedule should have allowed you a little more time to recover?
last night you had a right shoulder problem. did you have it today?
totally fine?
what was the like for you at the end of last year when you played at the world tour finals, had a big match against roger there, then within a few days you were playing davis cup on clay? andy murray has to do the same this year. how difficult was that, not only physically going from playing for yourself in the world tour finals, to playing for your team in the davis cup?
andy is talking about practicing on clay between bercy and the o2. did you do that and do you think that's a good idea?
how was it for you? what was the comparison between winning davis cup and winning a grand slam?
did you think that winning the davis cup was a more realistic chance than winning a grand slam?
you've been playing rafa in a number of memorable matches for a few years now. there was some speculation that his best days were past him. with the performance he put in against you just now, do you think the potential is there for him to be right back at the top in 2016?
from where we were sitting, that looked very good. what was it like from where you were?
you expressed a little concern from going from the day match to the evening match. tomorrow night against novak you start at the same time. is that now in your favor?
i know it's hard to rank these things. in terms of staying aggressive, hitting deep, painting the lines, where do you rank that in terms of your matches this year?
could you tell us the reason you're playing such an aggressive tournament?
looking ahead to playing novak. when you beat him in canada, that ended a round of seven or eight defeats. at that point had it been getting in your head at all or did you always feel that you would beat him at some stage?
the semifinal will be against novak. you beat him in canada this year. do you think you have a chance to beat him again? how much confidence do you have?
great consistency in masters this year. every one a semifinal except rome where you were forced to pull out. that must give you a lot of satisfaction.
novak has won 15 straight matches, 18 straight sets. how much have you seen him play recently and what do you make of that ridiculous level?
we asked bernard if he ever played a better set that he didn't win. what did you make of it from the start?
have you known he's had that talent all along? is that something you'll see more of, as well?
sorry to ask something not about the match. you posted today in weibo you played video games with your team. do you think you are the top one in the atp players video games?
in your rest what do you do? play games? read books?
looking ahead to your next game in which you will face either andy murray or tomas berdych, how do you like the odds against each of them?
you know tomas and andy so well. are you watching them play or expecting something new when you step up on the court against them?
throughout the end of the season, most of the players are getting exhausted, especially top players, physically and mentally. you already qualified for london. you will end this season no.1. what keeps you running at this high level at this moment?
with bernard, you said you noticed he's a bit more committed this year. knowing him so well, have you pushed him in that direction at all, given him advice? also given that he seems to be taking that onboard, is he a potential top 10, top 5 player?
it was a brilliant first set by bernard, but the second set was completely different. do you have any idea what was happening there in the second set?
your feeling about fighting against a big server.
you play better and better now. how do you feel about this match?
you kept telling us how important it was to control yourself emotionally on court. what is it like when you cannot control yourself on court?
is there something you're especially satisfied about in your game today?
what were you talking about with rod laver just before entering the court?
normally this is not your favorite part of the season, the last part. what are you looking forward to? what is the main objective for what's remaining this year?
you mentioned the importance of the performance from the baseline. you faced two big servers in a row. do you think it helps you or you may lack some preparation of all the long rallies in the further rounds?
roger loses first match, and nadal wins in tiebreak, kei lost in two tiebreaks, you're winning real easy. what's your secret?
today you spent 70 minutes on the court, yesterday 62 minutes. in the first three rounds in the china open, they were less than one hour. when you have matches as short as that, do you spend more time in the gym, practice more?
the facilities here for the players are amazing. you have your own locker room. do you think now the masters 1000s have reached their peak, the players are happy everywhere?
do you think it should be the standard?
the other day we talked to nishikori about the treatment he got in japan, quite like some boy band. in my opinion, the treatment you get here is not far from that. do any fans do anything crazy that scares you?
anything they have done that has stood out?
do you feel you're equally popular here in shanghai and beijing or are you more popular in beijing because you're even more successful there?
you're clearly playing the best tennis of your life. is there a potential for even improving or is it a question of maintaining this as long as possible?
give us your verdict on the match today.
when you say 'tough conditions,' are you talking about the weather or the air quality or...
there seems to be a sense about you, like you found your footing for life on the tour this year. you seem more comfortable with the whole process of being on the tour. do you feel that, as well?
you were obviously a notable junior. you come out here. now that you've been through it, how hard is it to have all these expectations on you at such a young age?
talk about how you turned that match around. he owned that first set.
on a general theme, i wasn't in tokyo last week, but i understand some of the crowd scenes wherever you went were pretty amazing. what is it like for you living with that kind of attention, thousands of people turning up?
can you let us into some of the strange situations that have happened in tokyo or in japan in general with the crowds chasing you around like a boy band or something like that.
nick was having a few conversations with the umpire during the game. do you feel like he was losing concentration during that match?
for most of your matches in your career, you have to play players taller and stronger than you, like nick today. is there any time you feel like it's unfair, like even when you were a kid?
we know that japan has very advanced technologies. i'm wondering if you're using any hightech technology to help you in practicing?
that was a really close one. can you go through this returning game you've done at 54 first set. do you think this game put you back on track?
first rounds are always tricky. do you think this one eased your nerves a bit?
do you have physical concern about the next match with raonic?
how do you feel with the conditions here at night regarding beijing? big difference here?
having to play another huge server tomorrow with raonic, is it easier now that you've been playing karlovic or is it tougher because it's a huge focus?
roger said last night that this is a tournament where he finds it particularly difficult to play the first match and get used to the conditions. you seemed to find your stride quickly today.
you left it quite late announcing when you would do in the asian swing. you've been to beijing last year. was that purely because of the davis cup considerations?
next up isner. i know you've had a match here already, but how do you feel going into that match?
you said beforehand that you were feeling mentally and physically fresh coming in here after your break. was that the same on court today? did you feel just as good?
i think the first game was probably your only trouble game, a couple doublefaults. what did you think about that game?
a nontennis question. your thoughts on the upcoming season for the heat?
do you think it was a case of you being too honest when you said after the davis cup semifinals that maybe you wouldn't go to the o2 arena? do you think it's added extra pressure on you at some point?
pretty comfortable start for you here in shanghai. talk about the match a little bit. went pretty quickly.
when you come to a tournament like this, you've won it a couple of times, do you have a better feeling about it, more secure feeling that you've done well here?
yesterday roger in the interview said you are the favorite to broke his record of winning 17 grand slam. after the us open you said you thought about it. do you think you can achieve that?
we're reaching the end of the year. how do you keep going?
is there any part of you that gets tempted after the type of year you've had to relax a little bit?
do you feel sometimes that the players that are stepping up in front of you on the court maybe don't believe as much as usual that they can beat you because of how well you played today? they say sometimes the matches are already won in the locker room.
with experience you've become such a disciplined competitor. when you see someone like nick kyrgios who three matches in a row has had code warnings, any advice you could give him how to manage a situation like this?
two tight sets. how did you feel regarding the conditions of play comparing to beijing and previous weeks?
how do you feel starting this last part of the season, fighting for london? do you feel fresher because you had weeks off due to injuries or is it still draining?
did you feel overall it's been a weird kind of season for you?
did you feel okay coming into the match? did he do something to bother you? how do you see how it played out?
first round last year you saved six match points before you won it. in the middle of the process, did it remind you of a dj vu because you lost the opening set, but you had to keep digging hard?
will you come back next year?
the other day you sounded very throaty and stuffed. have you been fighting a cold?
apologies for asking a question nothing to do with shanghai or the tour. you're probably aware of andy murray's bit of a dilemma at the moment. he's got the davis cup final on clay at the end of the year.
at the same time he's concerned about changing surface from hard courts to clay. he's talking about maybe practicing on clay before the world tour finals, then playing the finals, then going back to playing on clay. i wonder what your experience was like last year going from hard to clay. i know you had specific back problems at the time, but how tough was that?
you talked about the conditions of play today. can you explain what was the most difficult with that.
i know you mentioned shanghai is a priority. next year the big thing in your mind is rio. you've been calculating your schedule very carefully. and also 17 seems like a blocking number. are you going to be the person most likely to break that number or someone else?
back to today's match. is there any differences between tuesday and wednesday? top seeds always get out on wednesday, not tuesday.
what did you actually know about him before you played the match?
(no microphone.)
did you handle it as well as you would have liked?
you seem to get more distracted than some of the other players. i don't know if it's experience. they seem to be able to block that stuff out. is that something you hope to accomplish in the future or work on?
the cameraman talking, did you ask the umpire to deal with that?
can you talk a little bit about the match and in general how you felt despite all that other stuff, how you played? i know it's your debut here, as well.
one of the commentators seem to think you were also unhappy about the ball kids. is that correct?
you're not going to bring it up with the organizers or anything?
for those of us that haven't seen you since new york, what is the coaching situation like, the advisory situation?
when you work hard at home, on the practice court, who are you working with?
given the suspended sentence that's hanging over you at the moment, how is that impacting on you when you're on court at the moment?
you talked about what you did physically during that period when you were in glasgow. did you feel emotionally you needed a break? you've played well since you came back.
you say you're not in a rush to appoint anybody. can you see yourself going longterm without a coach?
but are you saying that person would be a coach in the conventional sense or is it someone who is more going to organize your life for you?
can you talk a little bit about your next match, playing nishikori.
in terms of the mutual agreement to skip davis cup last month, was there anything about the tie that you thought best to avoid or was it purely you needed a rest?
was it because you thought anything in the tie you thought was best to avoid or was it just that you needed to rest?
can you tell us who you practiced with after the match?
that point in the tiebreak, early in the tiebreak where you came in and took the serve on the halfvolley almost right at serve line was a remarkable point. what was the strategy in that point in particular?
you feel pretty comfortable with this ramped up new aggressive tactic? no turning back from it now?
(question regarding serve percentages.)
i remember you saying earlier, i think here a couple years ago, that you never went to your player box after a win. wasn't your style. you did today. what made you decide to change it up?
talk about what it's like to win a record seventh title here.
as you said, a lot of players said you improved your backhand since you started working with stefan. did you get any specific advice or tips from stefan?
you talked a lot this week about how much you like playing here. how much do you think your connection to this tournament is the fact that you've had so much success here?
this is the first time you ever beat no.1 and 2 in the world in a tournament?
and it also puts you into no.2 for the open. how much do you think that matters going forward?
you mentioned that long layoff and you came in refreshed. serve is rock solid. what else are you really happy with about your game?
simona halep said that when she has a little time to watch tennis, you're the only one she wants to watch. please tell us what you think about her game and her performances.
have you noticed the renewed aggression in roger's game? how do you go about handling that here of course and in new york?
talking about the tiebreak, it was a very close match and he took the tiebreak. you did double fault three times your first service game after that. were you still hanging onto the breaker a little bit at that point?
was the stomach pain from yesterday a factor today?
how tough was it to just go into a match, another final in cincinnati, and come up here as the runnerup?
you hit a couple returns pretty much right at the service line. i was wondering, you played him 40 times before and he hasn't done that much. what did you make of that strategy?
i'm sorry if you already answered this one, but how much did you want to win this one considering you won all the other masters 1000?
you played roger many, many times over many, many years. how does the roger you played today compare to the roger from other days?
sixth game of the second set, long game, you held off three break points. did you get the feeling that you were able to come back? we've seen you do it so many times.
going into new york how are you feeling with two finals of masters events and a lot of matches?
what about the elbow? is that okay?
roger now has gotten the last five matches from you, including the last ten sets. last five sets have been very close. you've been right there but haven't been able to get it done. what's preventing you from getting a set or win over him the last five times?
it's been a pretty hectic schedule since wimbledon. overall, how are you feeling now?
would you say there is a fatigue factor, second week in a row?
you lost earlier than expected at washington. i was wondering why you elected to play that with then three weeks in a row fully expecting to go deep in both canada and here, which you've done? your thoughts on deciding to play washington?
as someone who has won 11 masters titles yourself, what do you think of novak going for the chance to be the first person to win all nine events tomorrow? no one has been close to doing that before.
sorry if it's been asked before, but the prospect of not being seeded no.2 in new york concern you at all, or not bothered about that? if roger wins tomorrow.
what did you make of roger coming way up almost to the service line to return a few times? he's been doing that throughout the week.
with how many times you played him, is it surprising to see a new trick come out of the bag?
you mentioned the plan was to play canada and washington and skip here. this week would be a 4day training block. do you play simulated matches? do you play points? elaborate on that.
there were only two breaks of serve in the match. you broke him twice, but the match had the feel you were in control once you got the first break. did you feel that way?
along the lines of being happy with the match, are you happy with your trajectory in cincinnati? obviously didn't play last week and hadn't played on hard. obviously the open is right around the corner. with respect to match play, are you right where you want to be?
despite the fact that it's going to be a tough match, based on your last match against him, do you feel some extra confidence or just good feelings because of how you beat him?
talking of experience, i know you're saying you're focusing on cincinnati right now.
obviously there is a lot of talk about world no.2 and the seeding. does that really play into your mind, or are you just prepared for a tough us open regardless of where you end up in the draw?
yeah.
but doesn't really matter to you?
came very close to playing rafa. obviously lost the breaker yesterday. if he had won that you would've played him today. what are your thoughts on the state of his game at this point in time? obviously he's not winning as much as he used to, but still competing well. thoughts on his game, where it stands right now?
if you could, elaborate a little bit on some of the specifics that you have been working on recently with stefan edberg. i know you've been with him for a while now. anything since you brought him on more recently that he implemented to your game?
a very different outcome today. how do you feel after a good one like that?
4all and you broke him, and then broke him the first two games he served in the second set. you really raised your level yesterday. at this point in time at 4all did you raise your level, did he fade a little bit, or combination?
eight service games; one ace. was he able to read what you were doing, or was it more about placement rather than...
yesterday you talked about how the injury to your wrist had really messed up your serving, and obviously today it was fine.
the elbow, yeah. messed up your serving, your routine. do you feel now it's actually coming back a little bit after today?
you're going to play a different type of player tomorrow. will your preparation tomorrow morning be any different than the preparation this morning?
i want to ask you about last week. i know you got to the final, but you also played doubles. did that tire you out at all in going through the distance in montreal and being, you know, not maybe 100% physically, mentally to play the final?
do you think that you have enough support here from audience, your fans here in cincinnati?
i'm sure you're very disappointed of this loss today. how do you assess the improvement of your game between last week and this week, however?
three matches in montreal last week, two this week in cincinnati. doubles, as well. do you feel like you have enough matches under your belt ahead of the us open?
you talked about trying to eliminate bad matches. how do you do that, because you don't know when they are going to come? going into the us open now, how do you make sure you don't have a bad day?
how do you prepare as best as possible doing that?
when did you first get the sense this year that this was going to be a difficult year for you? when did you first start to get the feeling that this year, 2015, might be a difficult year for you? was it before the year even started? you had a lot of injuries and appendix end of last year.
have you learned anything new about yourself or the sport as you had these difficulties this year? hard times, you know, you learn about yourself and things don't come easy. just wondering if you had anything like that at all or you already understood that this could happen before?
you must have thought at some point that was a lost cause perhaps. so close to a major, what makes you find that little extra?
do you think winning matches like this one tonight could be the difference between getting to world no.1, winning matches like that, winning matches like the one novak won earlier.
you mentioned the 41 game in the second set, but there were huge games in the third set. any in particular that jump out at you that you felt you started to gain the advantage on him?
serena williams was saying earlier that she'd take an easy win over a hard one, but what can you get from such a tough match like that going into the us open?
last year people talked about your last year being disappointing, and when you qualified you wrote bad year on the camera. now something like that has happened with rafa. disappointing by his standards, but he's still no.7 in the race. he thinks he's relatively not doing as bad as everyone makes it out to be. just wondering how you think great players, when they do have a dip, how that should be assessed. like the sky is not falling.
you talked about the importance of opponents sort of never knowing when you're beaten, but i don't know if you're aware of the statistic that you have not lost a match all year having won the first set. you're obviously the great frontrunner, as well. what do you make of that?
(regarding the match with gasquet.)
seemed like your endurance has increased. back in miami when you played novak your legs kind of gave out on you. have you changed your training at all?
you were out on court 3 today. i know you played isner last year. great atmosphere out there as opposed to stadium. can you comment on playing a slightly smaller court and the atmosphere you experienced out there compared to a big stadium?
wonder if you can give an assessment of grigor's game tonight? do you think he's at a good point in his performance right now? tough to play against him?
some tough moments in that match. can you talk a little bit about where you thought the turning point was for you?
how do you find that groove? how do you find your own...
how do you feel about playing stan in the next round?
in canada you received a fair amount of oncourt treatment with your elbow. any lingering effect?
obviously it's hard to put those 45 minutes away, but how far do you feel from your best overall?
are you a player that enjoys getting revenge? have you been itching to get revenge over stan since...
you said conditions here are different than they were in canada and what they will be in newyork. how are they different?
impressions from the match?
what's it like playing someone you know so well?
you know his game so well. do you expect him to do some things that he might not normally do and do you try to do some things he wouldn't expect you to do?
how do you feel just about the season? you had early losses, couple of finals.
thoughts on davis cup in uzbekistan?
how has cincinnati treated you? what do you take away from this town?
for the younger americans you have played in the last year or so, whose game do you like the best or do you see breaking through out of those guys?
yes.
anyone else from the hitting partners from davis cup team you like?
guys are playing later and longer careers. do you feel any sort of urgency about your own career at this point? do you feel there is a long way to go?
are you clear about what it is you want to accomplish?
what kind of interaction have you had with mardy this summer?
of his generation, fish, blake, roddick and all those guys, and sampras' generation before that, which of that group kind of made more of an impression on you coming up? were you too close to those guys?
what do you think is mardy's legacy since he's wrapping it up in newyork?
your impressions of the match?
it's tough to play a friend, obviously. also just, you know, wondering about that and how your body is feeling in general.
that you're not 100%?
the body? how are you feeling again?
what did you feel wasn't working so great for you today?
will you rethink at all playing next week?
you're definitely not playing next week?
that's a done deal?
you're gonna rest up and...
...practice?
what's most important to you heading to newyork at this point?
will you go home?
football, precollege football, barbecues?
can you give me a couple of thoughts on mardy? he's going to finish up in newyork, obviously a former top 20 guy. when you see his career and his legacy in american tennis, what do you think about it?
how much were you watching those guys, roddick and blake, ginepri and fish when they were coming into their own in '04 or '05?
what do you like about sam's game?
how long have you played doubles with him?
you said on the court this was your biggest win in two years. how meaningful is it to get this one, and obviously over a top 20 player?
with respect to the us open, are you going to play doubles as well?
i couldn't hear what you said on the court to the group of fans that was cheering for you. your name was being screamed pretty much every play.
mardy, you poopoo'ed this top 10 win, but let's face it...
...he's not a nobody.
and you beat him 22. was that a oneoff or were you feeling that relaxed out there? what do you chalk it up to?
a little bit different being in singles than doubles match. (photographer interruption.)
what are some of the things you're most going to miss about being a pro tennis player after you retire?
is it getting easier for you as you play a little bit more this summer to deal to the issues spoke about? and also, are you hearing from people going through similar issues? you feel like you're fulfilling your mission in helping others?
any thoughts on facing andy murray in your next singles match?
how crucial was the tiebreak?
did you feel a lack of energy going into the third and fourth set?
when you look at the kind of competitor that you are, how and when are you able to separate the great run you've made from the disappointment of not getting it done today?
the crowd seemed to be overwhelmingly behind you today. how does it feel knowing you're so popular at wimbledon, and arguably britain's second favorite tennis player?
novak has described you as the greatest player in the history of the game. what are your thoughts on his place among the greats?
after the way you beat andy murray, even the bookmakers changed their opinions because they were giving you almost even with djokovic. when you won the second set, did you start thinking, i'm going to make it, or were you still doubting about yourself because you have djokovic in front of you?
well, forget the bookies.
what about psychologically? you saved seven set points.
can you compare the court conditions between your semi and today, how you adjusted, if that affected you at all?
andy murray told us last year, a loss here at wimbledon felt worse for him because he felt this was the best chance for winning a slam. for you is the defeat here any different than the way you feel about it compared to other places?
you spoke about not chasing anything. clearly your record speaks for itself, and your level of play, too. when you assess your performance, in light of your streak recently of not having success in the grand slam events, how does that come into play? how does the absence of a grand slam in your rsum the last couple years affect you?
you're serving unbelievable friday against andy. was it impossible to repeat today? did you feel you have to win two finals to win the tournament?
you haven't publicized much about what the rest of your schedule is going to be the rest of the year. do you know yet how much more you're going to do this year?
is there much you can do when a guy is serving the way he was today?
is it any consolation that you lost to arguably the best player of all time who is close to his peak?
do you think the scoreline is a bit harsher than the reality?
you elected to receive. that's quite a bold move. can you explain the thinking behind that?
considering what he's doing at this stage of his career, how would you describe what roger is accomplishing here when most people are not doing what he's doing?
is this as well as you've ever played in a loss, a straightsets loss?
how far is roger from being considered one of the greatest sportsman, not just tennis player, but sportsman that's ever been?
at any point in your mind did it come to you that, i need his form to dip a bit to have a chance?
after that epic game where he comes back and wins at love, i think, how much did that take away from the momentum you had achieved there?
can you talk a bit about that huge game in the second set, the emotions you went through.
speaking of the crowd, are you at all upset that there seems to be practically divided support for federer and yourself in these home championships? is that at all a problem for you?
i'd like to know your thoughts on the finals matchup. will you find yourself watching it or will it be something you avoid?
will you come to watch jamie's match tomorrow?
i'm sure loss is not great anywhere, but does it feel tougher for you when you lose here than other places, especially with fans?
i know it's short after the match, do you think it will be difficult to get into davis cup?
i have to ask.
is it ever frustrating that you and novak are maybe in the prime of your careers, the prime age these days, and that should be your time to be at the top of the sport, but here is roger almost 34 and he's still getting in the way?
you played very well, but at the end of the sets, because roger was always ahead, do you think he did something different, or maybe you felt too much pressure at that moment?
you won a lot of new fans out there on centre court. they fell in love with your beautiful backhand. is that any consolation at all?
when you saw novak seemingly have a bit of an injury, did that give you a bit of a lift? what was going through your mind at that stage?
the tiebreak, was that the key to the match?
it felt like you were the better player in the first set. did you feel that, too?
it's been a good tournament for you.
your grass court season is not over yet.
if murray wins and plays djokovic, who do you think will win?
who should i put my money on?
what is the single most difficult thing when you're facing novak?
you played a lot of sets and a lot of matches in your career. did you play many better sets than that first set and many better matches, full stop?
you can't compare matches, but even andy murray said you probably never served so well as you did today. did that a little bit surprise you, too, or not at all? also the draw, it was won by him, he decided to return. he was always behind following you in the score. do you think in the end it could have been a mistake or sometimes you do the same thing or you never do it?
not too long ago people were saying, why are you still playing? what motivates you? does a performance like this answer that?
what is it about this place and surface that always brings the best out of you as opposed to other places? is it any different now that you've done it so many times? is it, here we go again?
you've been widely acclaimed as one of the great players. this morning rod laver said you would win. a lot of people are almost in love with you, things like that. do you have like jose mourinho, that you're the special one?
were you surprised at all how evenly the crowd was split, bearing in mind it's andy's home tournament? in the olympics, the crowd were heavily on andy's side.
you thought they would be more on his side than they actually were in the end?
you were also talking the other day about how you don't play with the aim of proving people wrong. it's something a lot of players do talk about, especially when they win. i was wondering if you feel like it's helped you to play for positive reasons and how you manage to keep it positive.
what are your thoughts on the opportunity to face novak after the way things ended last year here, and also to add to your history in finals and at wimbledon?
what does that opportunity mean to you?
being no.8.
that game at the end of the second set was so huge. take a moment and take us inside that game. what was going through your mind? how did you stay focused?
talk us through that unbelievable shot in the final set. i think it was the seventh game in the third set. andy's return looks like a winner, you plucked it from nowhere.
unbelievable.
during your time working with boris becker, what's the best piece of advice he's given you to be a successful tennis player?
with you back in the final, i'd like to go back to the end of last year's final and think about the emotions you experienced, maybe when you covered your eyes what you were saying to yourself. it looked like you were talking to yourself at that moment. what was going through your mind and what you were saying to yourself?
and what you said to yourself?
i'm curious about how you deal with emotions going into a wimbledon final against whoever you're playing in this case, this will be a crowd favorite for different reasons. does it motivate you knowing it's all up to this specific match?
talk about your shoulder. you didn't have a medical timeout. can you tell us how it feels?
in previous years you've visited the buddhist temple in wimbledon. have you done that this year? is that somewhere you'll go tomorrow?
on your bike?
you don't push the baby?
can you comment on the match today. seemed the first set was the key today. after that you maybe settled down.
you've been no.1 for a lot of weeks in your career now. i'm wondering if it's been even harder to be no.1 than you thought it would be with all the pressure, always being the favorite. maybe assess what it's been like over such a long period now.
when you say you are the hunted one, is that the motivation for you to stay in front of everybody else, to stay ahead of everyone else? you know they're all chasing you.
it's possible in this situation you're again in the final, going next week to buenos aires to play davis?
30 years ago, boris won his first tournament here. if you were to win this weekend, you would equal his three triumphs also. what would that mean for your team?
a year ago you came into this final having not won a grand slam in a year and a half. you won this final last year, then won in australia this year. how much of a sort of change in momentum did you feel the final was a year ago, and how much confidence do you have coming in having already won in australia?
roger just took the second set as well. can you talk about the challenge of facing roger in the wimbledon final here is like for you? and if it is andy, can you explain your really good record against andy in recent matches.
you spoke earlier of thinking of the people who were so invested in your success when you were young. comes to your mind your former coach jelena. i know you think of her often, if she were here, what do you think she would tell you?
i wanted to ask about your impressions of the other players. do you still do them?
is it always goosebumps after you qualify for the final or is it starting to feel normal?
how do you manage to maintain the passion for a sport that consumes almost your whole life?
did you say earlier that boris has sleepless nights before your games?
is it good to have a coach that gets that nervous?
serena williams yesterday said, looking forward to the final, she doesn't need to win another wimbledon, that primarily she wants to have fun. does that apply to you?
what's more important, fun or winning?
that's not good enough. stop trying to fudge it.
what can you take from that to carry forward to the davis cup, as it's on grass?
is this like the longest grass court season you had?
had you hoped for more presumably from today's match?
this has been by far your best grass court season. what were your thoughts on the surface before you started this year?
three sets, but three close ones. what do you think made the difference today?
to cut to the chase, silly, but the time violation thing, how much did that upset you?
did it affect you at all?
such a fun match to watch for the spectators with the contrasting styles you had there. how much of a challenge is it against a guy like murray to do that?
the idea of having to come in and go to net against somebody that passes that well, how much of a challenge is that?
back to the time violation. is there a sensible way to get around this problem, if it is a problem, like a clock perhaps? do you have any ideas yourself about what umpires might do?
it's their problem rather than yours?
you seemed to have a good rhythm before the second rain break. what was the effect of the roof coming across? did it feel different? do you think it benefited him?
any consultation about whether they were going to close the roof? did they ask your opinion about it?
i know it is short after your match, how do you feel going on clay now for davis cup?
there was an expletive violation in front of the royal box in the third set, use of language.
for you, i thought.
murray is still good in long rallies. you've played so much tennis. was that a problem? you were just having to chase down balls? did the fatigue start to catch up to you a little bit?
that was probably about as undemonstrative as you've been throughout all your matches this week. you usually encourage yourself. was that a conscious decision because of the occasion, maybe an energy saver, or it just happened that way?
after milos lost, he talked about various problems he had. he was very assuring he was going to be able to play davis cup. you said you had a couple little things. any chance at all that you are going to pull a milos?
is this like the nhl, upper body, lower body? can you tell us what it is?
the serve?
i know it's quite early yet, but any reflection on the two weeks?
how aware are you of how big this played in canada, with 'anything is pospisil' hashtag?
you've had some good moments in your career obviously before. i guess the key is to take those and carry the momentum and build something big. how can you take this and go through the summer season on your favorite court and use all of this to really put a consistently long period of success together?
are you sure?
you really stepped up a level that pospisil didn't seem to be able to match. were you happy you got to those points?
rory mcilroy posted on social media a picture as he was watching your match, and he also said he's not going to be playing in the open championship. what are your thoughts about the open and jordan spieth?
and jordan approaching the possibility of a grand slam the way serena is, what do you make of that?
i know you're out there and competing and trying to win a match. vasek has a lot of variety in his game. would you say he's a fun guy to play against, what he showed out on the court?
just looking ahead to the semifinal. you've often said that home advantage is a big thing for you. do you think this is a match where it won't necessarily be such a factor, given the huge support that federer always gets in this country?
obviously a bit off and on today with the rain. was the shoulder thing at all a factor given you would have been cooling down a bit during the breaks.
roger is competing at the top at 33. how do you think he's been able to prolong his career and how much longer do you think he can keep competing at the top level?
the last time you played roger was a very onesided match. what did you take out of that and how have you changed since then?
the olympic final is almost three years ago now. probably that was your most emphatic win over roger, especially on the centre court. has your tennis and his tennis changed so much that that no longer has a pertinence?
you mentioned in the tv interview you had a chance meeting with him at practice this morning. can you elaborate any further?
i wondered if you had a chance this week to meet the duke and duchess of cambridge and whether you've been tempted to throw your wristband their direction?
roger hasn't lost a single semifinal here. even though times have changed over the years, how much does the fact that you have beaten him in a big match on centre court help you to try to overcome that?
what did you feel about the time violation rule? vasek was affected by that at the end of the second and third set.
how pleased were you with your performance under the roof? the forecast for sunday is a bit of rain. is it good to get some practice under the roof?
did you get a chance to speak to david beckham or anthony joshua or any other stars here?
summer of 2012, the olympics was a long time ago, it was kind of a turning point in your career, in a way a turning point for roger. last slam he won. can you talk about what that summer meant to you.
you were talking at queen's about looking at videos of your greatest hits, your best matches on grass. have you reviewed that and seen that olympic one again in the course of the last couple of weeks? would you also look at the 2012 final as well to see what you didn't do so well for your match on friday?
you said you spoke briefly with the duke and duchess of cambridge. what were you speaking with them about?
do you think djokovic should apologize to the ball girl he shouted at?
he shouted at a ball girl. he said, towel, shouted at her. she was a bit startled.
what do you think was the difference today between you and stan?
you showed a lot of mental toughness. you looked very confident. where did that stem from?
can you compare this match with your previous meeting with him in roland garros where you lost 86?
can you say a little bit more about when you say it was an emotional victory? can you say why it was so particularly emotional?
compared to 2007, in what way are you a different player and a different person now?
what is the key for you on friday to have chances against the world no.1?
in the previous semifinals you played federer, then nadal, now djokovic. what can you say about djokovic? what will be your game plan?
how does it feel to be back here in the semifinals playing andy at wimbledon? which memories does it bring back from the summer of 2012?
it's difficult to compare because you played so long, but you look as if you're playing as well and with as much ease as you've ever played. is that how you feel?
the summer of 2012, what are the memories that have stayed with you the most from those matches with the different results against andy? then your most recent match in december in the atp year end?
you set a record for yourself holding serve for 116 consecutive service games. how pleased are you with your serving? are you aware of these streaks while you're playing?
if we could continue talking about it for one more moment. is there something when you're in a match, maybe at the beginning of a match, that lets you know your serve is as good as it can be and that you're going to have a successful day?
against gilles, you haven't lost to him in a long time. you've beaten him six times in a row. what is it about his game that perhaps suits you? is it the flat ball that comes to your favorite height level, the speed of the ball, his serve?
there's a photo of you earlier today looking out on some of the matches from a balcony on the grounds. stan is playing now. how much tennis do you watch during a tournament when you're still active? how much do you watch when you're not active at a tournament?
you watched the french open final on the phone?
how did the rain delays affect you?
when you play andy, even in london you seem to get a lot of crowd support. how would you expect that to pan out on friday? how much of a difference does it really make?
during the bbc commentary of andy's game, there was a debate of whether his second serve was good enough against the top players. that is an area you might target when you play him?
you've had the experience seven times of looking at the trophy and seeing your name on it. when you look at that, what goes through your mind?
you played here now in three decades.
i'm wondering looking back on those years what you see as the most outstanding characters of this tournament venue?
very solid performance today. how did you assess it?
you seem to be doing everything well at the moment. it looks like there's maybe another gear to go. do you feel like you're playing within yourself?
there's been a lot of talk about the situation with the ball girl in your last match. how do you feel about those stories coming up? does it get to you?
gasquet just beat wawrinka in the other quarterfinal. what do you think about playing him in the semifinal now?
do you feel it's good news for you, not facing wawrinka in the semifinal?
you say that the media made a bigger deal than is necessary about the incident with the ball girl. pictures have surfaced on social media, people were quite worried about it.
that she looked very scared.
just to understand, you said you spoke to her. when did you speak to her?
and she's okay?
i don't actually.
i don't. which one is it?
can i ask you a question as well. you've played on each of the last three days. will that affect your preparations? will you scale down your practice?
your sixth wimbledon semifinal in a row. quite an achievement.
you talk about the experience that you've had here and how you hope it will help you and also about wanting that trophy. what is it like? what goes through your mind when you see your name on that trophy?
how do you assess the other semifinal between roger and andy murray? who would you make favorite in that?
if you were to make the final, do you have a preference of who you would face?
you speak of bouncing back. you have won here before. you hadn't won at roland garros. any sense in which coming here is an anticlimax after losing?
the tv commentators were saying before your match today that your match against kevin was your blip, you got that out of the way. do you feel you've overcome that blip? you feel almost more empowered now? it's given you a confidence boost?
are your legs fresh enough to be able to cycle to practice tomorrow?
back on the bike?
you're getting hammered on this ball person thing. there were others in the media center that were saying, hey, this guy is one of the top players, he's funloving, jokes with ball kids all over the world, giving them racquets. do you think there's another side to the story?
can you take a minute and talk about gasquet's game and his beautiful backhand.
what do you take from this tournament overall? what are the positives for you?
was novak too efficient for you? was he just too good at the small things sometimes?
this is the last grand slam before the us open, which you return to as defending champion. do you start to think about that yet?
what was it like to play in front of the royal family and david beckham today?
nervous?
when you were two sets down yesterday, what was your feeling? how was it knowing you had to come back and try to finish it today?
could you clear something up for us today. i think it was the sixth game, you won the point, then you had this kind of explosion of anger. i wasn't sure if you were shouting at boris becker, the ball girl, yourself, or the wall.
that was a reaction i would expect from somebody who lost the point.
so does my wife.
speaking of tough matches at wimbledon, what do you remember most from facing cilic in the quarterfinals a year ago?
were you annoyed that it went over to today? do you think it could have been finished last night? it's an added risk, isn't it, if it goes over to another day?
i'm sure you didn't mean to do it, but according to the photographers, there are pictures of this ball girl looking shaken up by your reaction towards her. after what happened in miami, will you try to find out who she is and make amends?
just last month you went through the experience of having to play on backtoback days going into a final. what did you learn from that? how did you feel then compared to now?
in paris you had to play also backtoback.
do you think that experience helps you now?
i'm sure you're pretty aware that today 30 years ago your coach won his first title here. was it maybe in the back of your mind that you might ruin his big day today with a loss?
today the davis cup captain make an announcement without you on the team.
when you start talking to yourself, as you said before, is it usually a bad sign or sometimes can be something that helps you to react and do better?
after you left here last night, was it difficult to wind down and get to sleep on time?
do you know about what time maybe you fell asleep?
i understand you in the last week or two have done a promotional video with a young british player called jonathan gray. you were encouraging of him yesterday ahead of his match. can you say a little bit about him as a young man, as a player.
he lost. it was close.
will you head out into wimbledon on your bike this afternoon to blow off a bit of steam?
do you get strange looks on your bike around wimbledon?
any curious incidents for us?
are you chasing or are you being chased?
i'd like to know if you think yesterday the first two sets, especially the second, you were probably lacking some competition since you didn't play any tennis, let's say seriously, after wawrinka's match in paris?
talk about the overriding feelings after coming so close and not quite making it.
do you think your moment was actually last night, was that the key moment?
the fourth game today when you had the two breakpoints, anything you could have done there?
he said afterwards it was probably his hardest match at wimbledon.
you haven't taken a single set off him since 2008. did you change something?
were you feeling that maybe he was getting nervous and frustrated at some point in this match?
having played djokovic today and murray at queen's in the final, how do you assess their potential matchup in the final?
how difficult is it at the end of the fifth set to be playing novak, even though your game is on, but how hard is it at that moment to get broken?
the gap has definitely closed between you and the top guys. do you feel you do belong now with the top guys?
were you surprised for the majority of the rallies you were actually on the baseline and novak was pushed back?
coming into this tournament you're 10th in the race. that means you're in a position to get back here in november. you need a much better second half of the year than you've had in recent years. what has made your form dip in the second half of the year in recent years? what makes you think that you can keep up this level to november?
who would be your tip for the title and why?
a lot of the bigserving guys have been having an impact, the way it used to be. do you see any explanation for that?
you receive a lot of support on social media, famous golfer. here with the crowd, did you feel especially yesterday they were going crazy for you? how is this experience for you?
where did it go wrong for you? can you pinpoint what exactly happened? seemed like two sets up you were very much in control.
first game of the fourth set was a bad game for you. broken right away?
if you could have stayed with him in the fourth, looked like you had a chance to get back into it?
second match in a row he's gotten stronger toward the end. did you feel him getting better as the match went on?
at the start of the match or before there seemed to be some issue with the balls. can you explain? you seemed unhappy with the balls they were giving you. what was that about?
how did you feel that match went today?
is it a surprise after the australian open in 2009 to come back and get your second slam quarterfinal on grass?
you talked about the interruptions. there was like a 15minute break when the fan got ill. what goes through your mind? were you worried that it would break up your rhythm?
where would you say this performance rates in the context of your whole career?
i know you think a lot about the details of the game. when you were serving to tomas and also gal and other players this week, you have been, on the second serve, going down the t, trying to get to their backhands almost every time. that's what i'm seeing, anyway, in the stats. do you worry that becomes too predictable, or is it that's just your favorite serve to hit, kick serve down the t?
you have roger federer next. can you talk about the challenge of facing him here on grass? i know you have challenged him before on other surfaces.
this tournament is quite unique that there is middle sunday and then they make the women all play early today, so they play on the outside courts, some of them, because they are playing again tomorrow. so wozniacki was talking about the fact that it's a bit unfair for the women because they don't get a lot of opportunity to play on the big courts here. when you look at the schedule, i mean, you're experienced on the tour, do you feel that the women here don't get the chance to play on the big courts as much as the men?
there are people who call berdych an underachiever. they say he has the game to win slams and all of that. do you agree with that, or do you think that what someone achieves in tennis is what they should achieve?
you must be absolutely exhausted.
andy says there is a possibility the fatigue may play a part on wednesday. will you be fresh? will you be ready?
will you just be letting the body relax?
can you kind of sum up the singles match?
you have forgotten about it?
did it help you having been through a fivesetter on the wimbledon show court two days ago?
can you walk me through your morning. when did you get up? what did you do before you got here?
that was a long time ago.
may i ask what the half hour "things" are?
what are you reading in your book?
secret, as well? are you writing it in the morning, is that the secret part?
is it a motivational page?
talk about andy murray.
you played against a british crowd already with james ward. how beneficial is that that you have already been in that atmosphere?
you said you have been working on trying to be more clutch. you mentioned it again now. what is it you're doing to do that? is it a matter of focusing or not thinking about the moment or thinking about the moment?
do you think you would have won that match a year or two ago just in terms of hanging in there when things got bad and being clear headed enough to make the adjustments you had to make?
can you expand just a little bit on what you mean by the tactical, what adjustments did you make?
what did you do in the roughly two hours' break between singles and doubles?
in the doubles match, you and jack got really, really angry.
tell us all about that.
said he didn't feel it?
did that help?
are you better when you're angry?
do you almost regret that in a way?
no, but in terms of you spending an extra hour and a half, extra hour and a half today on top of a long day?
centre court last year in the doubles, do you think that will prepare you for playing andy?
you always seem like a tactical, thoughtful player. on match point, maybe a couple other times, big second serve, deuce court, he's guessing you're going down the middle, you fool him going wide. is that an effective tactic?
you must be delighted with the accuracy of your serving.
you certainly know a fair bit about your next opponent. three times you played him in the last 10 months.
going to be different now, you would imagine?
take your brother out for dinner tomorrow, see if he'll give you a couple of tips. doing well at the moment.
back on karlovic. i think you lobbed him five times. is that something spontaneous?
was that something you thought was a proper game plan and you kept going to it?
you spoke immediately after the game on tv about what satisfied you the most in your game. was there anything that sort of troubled you a little bit that you think you need to work on?
you come away pretty content overall?
nick was in the room right before you. he was upset about some things the media say about him. he said he felt misunderstood. you're someone who spent a lot of time with the media growing up. what can you tell him or what kind of advice can you give him, because he seems to have trouble dealing with it.
do you think he's misunderstood?
i know you were focused on the court here today. what was your reaction to the injury and the way it happened to your friend rory mcilroy today?
you've had a slightly mixed relationship over the years with hawkeye. i'm wondering where that call
they don't always get it right.
have you ever been so pleased with the outcome of a real hairline call as that crucial one in the fourth set today?
how is the shoulder? two or three days. did it clear up at all?
there's been some talk about leon smith coming to scotland.
doing more coaching in scotland. what would be your view going forward? would that be a good outcome, first of all?
four scots. your brother has just won. maia lumsden, the third seed. anna brogan, in the top seeds. a wave of scottish kids coming through after you.
you mentioned about nick finding the right balance between emotions on the court and off it. the situation now, the way you control yourself, is that purely evolution, or is it something that maybe amlie has brought to you?
you said pretournament you thought you were playing better than you were in 2013. how do you compare to how you feel your game is than any previous wimbledons at this stage?
when you saved those two match points and won the set, did your mind go back to last year at all or were you able to keep positive?
what is the general experience like playing against nick kyrgios? i couldn't be sure if he was arguing with you, the fans. must be a crazy experience to be at the other end of the court?
yes.
there was a moment in the second set where he appeared to give up on the service game. did you notice that? what did you make of that?
is it hard to concentrate when a player does that?
do you think he was playing under par which helped you to win or did you think you had to raise your game in order to win the match?
what's he like away from the courts? is he a player that other players like and are friendly with or is he a bit of a loner that keeps to himself?
you're being very generous about him before the match. do you still feel the same about him as an opponent?
any gamesmanship?
you're back in the quarters after many years. how does it feel to be back? does it help that you managed to get through a situation you didn't succeed in last year? does that give you any extra confidence?
do you think smashing that racquet helped you win today?
worth it, though?
i was watching the match. you had john mcenroe and tim henman raving about your performance. do you think you made a statement today? talk about how much you served and volleyed as well.
you come to this tournament virtually untroubled. can you remember a time when you've had it not easy, but so smooth a passage to this stage of the tournament?
you've been at the top for about 12 years now. a lot of players talked about how you inspired them growing up. why do you think there haven't been a wave of younger players from switzerland coming up behind you?
but kids.
you are aware that juan martin del potro is not able to come back to the tour yet. would you encourage him to play with a onehanded backhand instead of two? do you think it's feasible at this age?
the women's singles draw has had fewer matches on centre and 1. fewer than other slams. caroline criticized that scheduling today. what do you think about that? do you think it should be allocated more evenly here, especially considering women's matches are shorter, so if you have two men's and one women's?
i know we're mid tournament, but a question relating to your sons. to me, the name lenny is short for leonard, and the name leo is a shortened name for leonard. can you explain the naming of your sons.
there was a moment on court2 today when kyrgios appeared to tank a game, not try.
one game, yeah. can you understand someone getting frustrated and doing that or do you find that disrespectful?
towards the crowd who paid good money to watch you.
your serve hasn't been broken since kohlschreiber broke it in halle. over 100 games now. any reason for that?
this year you played in istanbul. you have many fans there. they loved you being there. would you say a couple of words of how the experience was for you.
that was a bit shorter than your previous two matches. you must be pretty happy to have knocked it off in four?
second year in a row you're through to the quarters. how close do you think you are to the sort of form that you brought to newyork last year?
novak's obviously struggling at the moment, but if it was to be a repeat, you went close to beating him here last year. what do you think you'd have to do this time to get past?
and if it's kevin?
just talking about the us open, are you superstitious or do you think you're going to do all the same things that you do last year when you go to newyork? are you going to change some things in terms of hotels?
so there are players who are, but you're not a superstitious player?
thoughts on the match? his serving at the end seemed to be outstanding.
what was the experience of being on court1 like?
what are the emotions? do you feel that was a big chance missed given the fact when he went off for the toilet break, he appeared to be mentally shocked, but he came back seemingly rejuvenated after that?
what will you take out of this week?
what would be your game plan now? obviously there's davis cup. i presume you'll be into a few more tournaments than you might otherwise have been.
do you take a couple of days off now?
can i ask what the umpire said to you?
is it a bit disarming, not just in your match, we've seen it quite a few times here this week, of line judges sort of snitching almost.
did you have a chance to speak to your dad after the match?
there is a very special atmosphere when you play with gal. can you just comment on this and what it was like out there on centre court with those people doing the wave and all that?
can we ask how you're shoulder is and if you know how mr. seppi's leg is?
without citing specific people, do you have any views on whether the rules on medical injury timeouts should be tightened up or not?
you finished on good terms, smiling at the end. no acrimony between you. there was an understanding that the game was fine. there was no gamesmanship, shall we say.
do you know exactly what the problem is?
is it difficult not to panic when something like that happens? everybody in the court got a fright. how do you keep on top of that? is there a feeling of panic with so much at stake?
how bad is this? is it a niggle, stiffness, soreness?
you have never asked for an mto this year, and seppi also never asked either. but the physiotherapists aren't genius. either the injury was not too serious or really when you call mto, somehow you break the rhythm of the others. you both made six games in a row.
which one of the two things do you think is the right one?
psychologically it helps the one who asked for the break, correct?
it did look as though when he had his timeout, you had your doubts about whether there was anything wrong with him. is that the way you were feeling?
what would you have done?
down a different lane. andy, ali collins played for the first time today. how well do you know her? is there funding in place and structure for kids coming out of scotland to achieve what they can achieve?
karlovic now. got a great record against him. how will you nullify the weapons he brings on grass?
did you see any of james' match? how much can he take out of this tournament?
the shoulder should pass. how well do you think you played for three of those four sets? how would you assess your form going into the second week?
the fourth set, you seemed incredibly pumped up. you were interacting with the crowd. your energy level seemed to rise enormously. can you describe that fourth set, how you did that.
with ivo karlovic, can you try to explain the difference that the serve makes coming from that enormous height?
i believe that's 136 aces in three matches so far. i mean, how much form do you think you're taking into  looks like it will be andy murray at the moment in the next round. how do you feel you're playing?
when you've got your service going like that, you must feel almost like no one can beat you because you're never going to get broken.
you've never beaten murray, have you?
do you feel confident?
in the fourth set today, you were set point down at 67. you appeared to hit the ball twice with your volley winner. i mean, were you aware that you hit it twice at the time?
i mean, the replays make it look like it's not one motion.
can you describe the play exactly what happened on it?
he didn't say anything to tsonga about it. did he query it?
what did you think at the time when that happened?
what is the feeling for you at your age to be into the second week of wimbledon and be the oldest man still in the competition?
it's a fair chance you play murray in the next round on centre court. will it worry you to go out and basically upset a whole nation by beating a brit?
how do you explain your longevity in the game? is it partly your style of play that you're able to save some energy because there aren't a lot of long rallies? or is there something else behind it?
what do you think about the fifthset tiebreaker? do you think it's a good idea?
in the slams.
obviously you have been through these kind of things before, but how hard is it to sit out a night and come back out? is it when you first come out that you're most vulnerable again?
when you have to be on right away, do you go through a longer warmup or how do you get ready for a situation like that?
we have seen denis kudla have a great run here at wimbledon this year. what do you know of denis? he's obviously had a great grass season?
a little bit.
i was watching when the referee came up to you last night. you looked disappointed. did you want to go on?
too dark?
what were you saying, one more game?
did you do a lot of thinking back to the long, long, long one?
because of this?
not at all? didn't really...
would you like every court to be lit so that this these matches could be completed?
what about starting earlier? they do 11:30 here instead of 11:00. every little bit can help.
i don't want you to be in a position where it's sour grapes, but on the two calls, do you think you would have won those two points?
with the calls going like they were, double fault at the end looked pretty close. did you think...
just in case?
is there anything in your mind you can chalk those up to?
yeah, trying to be too aggressive, do you think, or the nerves you mentioned earlier?
do you feel marin is back at that level, and he will be defending his us open title in a couple of months? he had the injury for a while, but it looks like he's come good again.
do you prepare differently for that? do you sit down with your guy before and say, let's get it done quickly?
you were 3love up in the fifth set. then you end 10all and you have all the night to think about it. what was the emotions?
you lost that match?
what do you think of the fifth set rule, playing it out? obviously people were thinking of the most famous match here, went 7068. do you think they should have a way of stopping the fifth set at some point? whether at 66, play a tiebreaker, or some other point? do you think it should be able to go 7068?
do you know anything about denis kudla?
where would you rank this in your favorite surfaces? hard court be no.1 and this no.2?
we know goran's record here. how much more is he helping you or how much more are you discussing here than you would be at other places? how much more input is he giving you here?
how has your relationship with him changed? i mean, you have been together a pretty long time now. in the beginning i'm sure there is a lot of talk and communication and change and stuff. what is it like now?
sounds like a lot of it is friendship as opposed to, you know, the typical coach, you do this, you do that.
would you say the match today was tougher than the one with rafael nadal?
how would you rate your play today?
was there a window where you could have turned the whole thing around?
you hit that outrageous return of serve. came back over. is that something you've done before?
can you compare grass to clay?
you said you would have signed up for it. how would you sum up the whole experience of this week, even beyond the court?
(indiscernible) was in the crowd today?
sponsor patches.
can you talk about that.
what is the schedule now?
are you going to the us open?
did you have a schedule planned after here?
dreadlocks are so beautiful. talk about playing elite level tennis with the dreads? do you enjoy it? ever been a downside?
did you not consider taking any kind of break after this?
are you planning to get back to jamaica at any stage?
you should be proud of yourself.
you're proud of yourself?
on a scale of 1 to 10, you would say 9?
besides beating rafa, what is the best memory you will take home from this wimbledon tournament?
will the money you've earned here help you perhaps get more of a fulltime coach? you've been working with craig.
do you have debt to pay off at all?
you said after the match that you had three perfect matches here so far. what has been working for you so well this week?
what does it mean to you to be into the second week here and playing with such confidence?
your backhand seems to be gathering a lot of attention. on court1 today, some of the crowd, they really appreciate your backhand. that shot is becoming one of the more famous ones in the game. is it your favorite one to play? what makes it so special?
you probably had slightly less success on grass than you have obviously on clay and hard courts. can you explain why that is when your game seems to fit grass so well? do you actually feel more comfortable on it this year?
what are your thoughts about the matchup against your next opponent?
how many marks would you give yourself today? how important has it been that you could get through so comfortably, leaving yourself with plenty of fuel in the tank?
i would like to go back a few weeks to roland garros, when you won versus djokovic. he was extremely a sportsman in accepting his defeat. does it happen to you often to realize how different are the players towards the defeat? some are good losers, some are bad losers. do you think that djokovic was exceptionally wellmannered that day?
how was that for you?
what lessons do you take away from the experience today?
(indiscernible.)
how far do you think he can go here?
you have been hitting with him. what's it been like?
you had a few sort of struggles. is it a matter of nick just winning to win over fans and winning matches and australian public can be fickle at times?
is your schedule unchanged? still go to newport?
probably not. certainly not at pat rafter arena.
if nick said he was going to play, would you have gone to newport instead?
have you told newport yet, bernie?
you played magnificent for the almost two sets. how do you explain what happened after that?
you were taking your chances a lot going to the net in this match. was it to rush him, take time away from him?
there were obviously physical issues. things there before you started the match or did it happen as the match went on?
was it just the feet? you seemed to be wincing when you were reaching. i wondered if there was something else...
how do you take that loss? maybe you were not 100% ready, he's going to come back, was it frustrating because you thought you could still go through this one?
it's normal pain? you have been told it was going to hurt for some time?
you had the green light from the doctor to play those tournaments or you said i want to play...
the velocity on your serve dropped quite a bit towards the end of your match. was that another thing you were dealing with or it just happened?
(indiscernible)?
do you think it will affect davis cup?
are you sure you're going to play davis cup on clay or do you think maybe it could be dangerous or...
what were you thinking about some of the things that were going on on the other side of the net, talking to the crowd and gesticulating?
did you see the racquet go into the crowd when he smacked it?
does it make a difference to you when there is that kind of atmosphere? i mean, you're just playing your game and that's it?
obviously there is the element of you in this level, but were you surprised how he was able to sort of raise his level and serve so well at the end or was some of that maybe you not returning too well and...
you were tuning him for the first set and a half. obviously he looked very frustrated, kept looking at it every time you hit that shot?
the question is had you planned to do that or just improvised it at the time because he was cheating over to the backhand side?
in hindsight, do you think you might have been better not to play queen's and, say, playing nottingham a week later or something like that?
how much of a goal is davis cup for you for the canadian team this year?
you missed the french open, going back on clay court, is it a chance, not to redeem yourself, but play on the clay? you didn't play during roland garros, but you get it in davis cup?
it's going to be slower.
is there an advantage for you?
would the hip be the no.1 place that was bothering you related to the foot?
it's all on the same side?
you really turned it on from 43 down in the second set. was it the headband?
the headband help?
was it a tip to anyone?
it's almost like a symbolic turnaround from last year. this time you win. is it a measure of how far you've come in your own mind?
he brings a lot of heat with his serve, 10 miles an hour more often than you. you seemed to outserve him. your impression, as well? can you talk a little bit about your serve.
you had a wild doublefault. is that kind of the way you are, then you get calibrated, because the serve was fantastic after that?
what are the things you have to do well against richard, he'll be chasing revenge himself?
you have a pretty good record in grand slams compared to the regular tour. how do you explain that? is it a question of motivation, fiveset format or...
can you reflect on the match with richard from last year. how important was that for you?
three days till the match. routine stay the same?
you mentioned sort of feeling different physically out there than a year ago. is that a result of any changes you've made in the way you prepare? if so, tell us a little bit about that.
everyone got excited last night watching dustin brown playing. how important is it to play entertaining tennis?
can you explain what you did with the headband? they were telling you to turn it insideout. what is your general thought about the dress code here?
what's the situation with the headband?
thanks.
about the entertainment, do you feel sometimes to lose your focus or concentration when you play with the crowd or with the ballboys? how do you keep focused after?
there was a guy in a batman tshirt that you were speaking to off the court. did he help you during the match?
there's not as many characters in tennis as there used to be. you're your own man, play with personality. do you feel there's a bit of conformity in tennis?
how important is it you're attracting a lot of young fans to the sport?
you had some very good interaction with the fans. at one point you told one off for saying something that wasn't funny. can you recall what that was?
he got you a lot on insideins down the line. you were playing crosscourt, insideout forehands. crucial points, he kept going to your forehand. fantastic passing shots crosscourt. do you think he went there too often?
how did you lift your level so dramatically after the first set?
how did you change your diet?
a fan at this year's australian open called out to serena, telling her to bend her knees, which she did. she said it helped her. could you tell us what the fan said to you that was good advice?
nick bollettieri talked yesterday about the letter he sent to you. can you reflect on this letter and what's inside?
you said you don't care what people think about you. are you aware there's a lot of discussion back home in australia about you and your image, your behavior?
are you concerned at all about that?
do you think the further you go in the tournament, it might change people's opinion?
what about the ones who aren't onboard, and then if you keep winning, jump onboard, what do you think about that?
you have a lot of belief. do you think you can go all the way and win the tournament?
were you surprised by the nadal result yesterday?
what were the dynamics or the physics when you hit the racquet and it went up? how did that happen?
you weren't planning to do that?
that's your second time in the fourth round of a grand slam. congratulations.
baghdatis didn't seem to have a lot of answers to what you were throwing at him today.
you came in with some form after making the final in 'shertogenbosch. are you feeling comfortable on the grass at the moment?
how do you sum up that performance?
you held serve throughout the match. that must have added confidence, as well.
your next match is against nick. you played him last year. didn't go your way. can you reflect on that match and how different do you feel today compared to last year?
was it difficult to get over it? did it stay in your mind for a while?
he talks a lot during matches and engages the crowd. he's is a different kind of player. is it easy for you to stay focused when you're playing someone like that?
what is key for you to do against him in the next match? he's improved quite a bit since you played him.
you have beaten grigor five times now. why do you think you play so well against him?
can you talk through what happened at the end when you walked off the court, with the prosthetic limb.
what is the most unusual thing you've been asked to sign?
during that match, a number of times, especially in the middle section, love30 on your own serve, then you play unbelievable tennis. is it you getting angry or you staying calm, a mixture? didn't seem fair on bernie at times.
i was wondering if you watched rafa's match yesterday. if yes, you know him so well, are you surprised to see he can't really find his game back?
as someone who enjoys golf and someone who enjoys grand slams, what are your thoughts about jordan spieth and his being halfway to the grand slam in golf, him doing this well at this young an age?
i know we are in wimbledon and is a goal for you. here the argentinian army are excited because they're playing with serbia in 10 days davis cup. we want to know if you're going to come to buenos aires, what is your plan?
what are your thoughts looking ahead to your next match, kevin anderson?
when maria sharapova was in here a few minutes ago, she said every time she walks on to the grounds she thinks about the experience of having won the championship here. when you walk onto the grounds or step on the court, what images of your past experiences are back in your mind?
you are playing very well. how do you judge yourself currently how you play? what part of your game are you most working on?
john mcenroe said that rafa may have to reconsider having the same coach for so many years. you have hired a very experienced coach, and so have other top players. do you agree with mcenroe and what do you think that rafa should do?
you've been coached by marian for many years before boris came on your team. how is it to get used to another voice?
it seems you always have troubles against richard. what is the most difficult for you against him?
would you say it's more lack of confidence for you at the moment?
when you got to the semifinal here last year, a lot of people thought you would be the next young player to break into the big four. why do you think that hasn't happened for you?
what is it like when you're watching the videos of yourself and seeing yourself doing things you would rather not be doing?
richard did play well, but it wasn't like you to miss so many backhands at the net, especially in the middle of the second set. was that his game, the bounce? was that you?
you and milos are roughly the same generation. he lost to kyrgios today, who plays an emotional game. what do you think of his game?
kyrgios.
is he a different kind of creature, a bit like dustin brown?
when did you start to sort of have the feeling you weren't a young player anymore?
looking at the top guys, do you know how they do it and it's just a question of doing it?
did you see roger's hot dog lob yesterday? presumably you have to feel confident in your own play to try something like that yourself today?
you were feeling confident in that first set to go for something like that.
in the past you were very proactive, like when things weren't working, you changed coaches. do you still follow the instinct that clearly something is not working?
what pleased you most today?
you looked very relaxed. were you?
can you describe your emotions on getting through to the third round for the first time.
you could see in the final point, you gave a yell. what was going through your mind in that moment when it's still really fresh?
that win should put you inside the world's top 90. how important is it to crack the top 100?
this is the first time since 1999 that uk tennis has had three british players in the third round. are we getting better as a nation?
you played so well in the davis cup recently. do you feel you've managed to transfer that form now to wimbledon? can you take a bit of the spotlight off of andy murray and help him?
you said in the flash interview, it would get a few people off your back. does it prove a point? maybe levels things out?
clearly the money is not your motivation. going forward for the next 12 months, does the prize money give you some surety that will give you confidence for the next year going ahead?
can you identify a particular shot in today's victory that most pleased you?
playing this well, do you feel your still the second best player in the country behind andy?
what do you know about pospisil?
do you still live in the flat?
have you got a house in sight? maybe the money will help.
how much does having an elite player like andy lift up the other british players if it's just from hitting with him...
the new lta funding plan means there's less direct funding for players outside of the top 100. does that create pressure for you and for players lower ranked than you that you might lose money?
is winning backtoback games at wimbledon the equivalent of arsenal winning backtoback fa cups? what would winning in the third round represent?
i understand your dad was watching today. what influence has he been on your career?
you were talking about your goals. what are they?
if i'm not mistaken, a couple years ago you were telling us your dad is a cabbie and he drove you to matches. same routine this morning?
you said earlier how andy has been a big help to you. what sort of specific things or advice has he given you?
saturday is going to be something pretty special for british tennis. what is it going to be like to be a part of that?
aljaz was saying after the match the other day that his british status could help all the british players improve. can you draw each others on?
you talked about players can get shot down in this country.
do you think the pressure on players in the uk is unrealistic?
the committee obviously thinking about putting you on centre or no.1 on saturday. how big a deal would that be for you? would it create extra challenges?
started off well. how did you feel about the way you played?
it looked, to me anyway, like he played out of his mind.
as much as that guy has won, do you think like losing last year to djokovic, especially when he comes back, looks like he has a good shot, do you think something like that possibly stays with him and he has a point to prove?
you were in really good form coming here this week. i mean, how much do you feel like he was on next level to where you were at today?
i believe you hadn't played him in a while, since '07 or '08 when he was kind of at the height of his powers.
is it too far distant or can you compare that roger federer to the guy you were playing today?
are you still working with rodney marshall, with the rocket?
he's worked with a lot of you guys. what does he do that's so special, and you guys running and sand dunes and all that kind of stuff to get in shape?
psychologically, how hard is it when you play federer to keep going, just sort of try and remember where you are and not think, i'm playing this guy, you know, on centre court?
james ward won today, and you have seen him at his best. when he is playing that well, how good can he be? what do you remember from the davis cup?
i forget.
pospisil.
he's really been a thorn in the side of the u.s.?
is that aggravating?
would you say at the end of that, i did my best, gave it my best shot?
yeah.
how much have you admired and watched what your good friend madison keys has done these last few months and the pressure she's faced to follow it up after the australian open run?
what's your summer schedule?
a step up from your first round. are you happy?
in terms of your firstweek performances over the years, was that one of your better ones?
my impression was in the third set there was a lot more selftalk going on, more intense. was that about trying not to kind of relax when you had such a strong lead?
with the way the weather has been recently, how different are the courts playing this year? do you like the way they're playing?
you kind of accept that you're going to have one match off of centre court. because you played so much on centre court, when you see yourself slated to play on no.1, is there any sense of a greater vulnerability there because it's not the court you're so used to?
you've seen james do really well in davis cup. i assume you saw the end of his match. what enables him this year to break through here?
how do you compare that with your firstround game?
compare the two opponents.
the duchess of cornwall said she was delighted to receive your sweat bands after the game.
what are your thoughts on heather watson playing serena williams? what message do you have for heather on the eve of that match?
since coric and seppi are 6all in the third, would you give us a word about each of them?
is that the question you were looking for today, in terms of an opponent you have struggled with in the past to some extent? is that an important ingredient, to have that killer instinct, that ruthlessness?
the other british players quite often said how supportive you are of them. james just said it. i'm wondering what kind of form it comes in? is it a text saying, well done? have you ever sat down and had heart to hearts with them, passed on tactical insight that you've gained?
i've heard that kim carries with her a lucky denim jacket for your matches. is that true?
if it is to be coric, he's one of the few players you lost to this year. will you look at that match again?
did you get a chance to speak to james afterwards?
do you think he has the ability to go this far in grand slams and further in the future now?
what does he have to do against pospisil?
are you playing better than you were this time last year?
yes.
you said you feel like it was a good match. on a scale of 1 to 10, would you say it was an 8 or 9?
after the match, sam said you have an aura about you, you hit amazing shots. he said sometimes you have the feeling as an opponent that you want to go over and give you a high five after one of your shots.
do you feel as though you have an effect on your opponent psychologically because of the shots that you hit?
a while ago you said that you had trouble earlier in your career getting inspired. then you went to certain art galleries, listened to certain music, talked to certain people, and that helped. can you talk about that.
what makes you go for a shot like the one that you did, through your legs? do you just want to have fun and entertain the crowd?
the issue of the famous allwhite clothing here has come up again. you've been quoted as having called that rule ridiculous. we don't know the source of that quote.
would you like to tell us right now what you do think about the rule.
the british crowd are desperate for you to get your hands on that trophy, even if it is one more time. what is your message to the supporters out there for you? how determined are you to do that?
the other day you spoke about serena's pursuit of a grand slam. what chance have you had to watch in golf, jordan spieth and his possible grand slam? what are your thoughts about him?
when you came off court, john mcenroe described your performance as one of the alltime greats that he's ever seen here at wimbledon of a lowranked player playing on centre court. how would you describe your performance out there today?
your return game is really interesting and unusual for the tour these days in terms of dropshots, aggressive returns. talk about your approach when returning serve against nadal.
as you think about your accomplishment, what goes through your mind about rafa's career and legacy?
you have a very stunning tattoo. tell us about it.
what did you feel when you went up to serve for the match?
you're being appreciated for your exploits on the court as opposed to being the only rasta involved in the game. how does that make you feel?
the first set was an epic contest that you very much deserved to win. how did you mentally cope with the fact that possibly the third and fourth sets were a bit easier for you to win? was that difficult to cope with mentally?
you said to me something that was very interesting. you said, i am the way i am. could you take a moment and explain what you meant by that and also could you reflect on all those years in the volkswagen camper, what those experiences were like.
do you feel this coming, this level of success, maybe not beating rafa on centre court, but the form that you have now?
you said that you would much prefer to play rafa on grass compared to the clay. is that a feeling overall for the guys in the locker room, playing rafa on grass compared to any of the other surfaces?
a lot of players, their personalities get expressed in their games, the way they play. how do you think that your personality is expressed through your tennis? what can we see about you in the way you play the sport?
do you think other players don't want to play you?
what do you make of your performance?
considering you're a home player, it was quite a quiet crowd. do you feel they could have been more behind you a little bit?
this is your first competition officially as a british player? is it going to be more of a learning experience this year?
in terms of picking up the vibes from the home crowd. you're representing britain now since march.
what do you plan to do now? do you plan to go around to support the other guys?
you get a nice bit of prize money getting into the second round. any idea what you want to spend that on?
no gifts at all for yourself?
did the success of james ward and andy, did that put a little bit of pressure on you to make it a hat trick?
you mentioned it was kind of very tight. it was sort of, first two sets, it was one point here or there. is that kind of heartening to know how close you can be to really sort of making a significant step up?
any goals for next year in terms of wimbledon? have you got kind of a thirdround prize in mind, something like that?
it's whetted your appetite this year for coming back and even bettering this next year?
how would you describe the match today? was that easy for you?
offbeat question. having been on tour for a number of years, if you had to pick the best shot of any opponent, what would it be and why?
why?
you slammed the door pretty firmly after a shaky game there at the end. sometimes it's good to have a big serve, eh?
when you have a weapon like that serve, you're a young guy, does it take a couple of years to organize the rest of your game around it? can you talk about that a little bit.
you feel it's complete now?
tommy haas at 37, what do you think about that?
in the third set, did anything approaching anxiety, if not panic, start to settle in with you?
was there any sense of trying to finish in three, and the third set maybe you pressed a little bit to try to get it over in three?
there is a lot of talk about what a big asset a big serve is on grass, but do you approach grass court tennis, especially here, differently in a way you're going to serve or how much emphasis you put on the serve? what is your philosophy that way?
more flat?
what are your thoughts on facing nick?
what do you remember about that match most from last year?
what are the aussie fans like when they come out for nick or other australian players in your experience?
how much have you improved since that victory?
talk about a sleeve off. there's a suggestion that the winner gets to keep sleeve rights and the loser the next time you play maybe has to go sleeveless?
do you think it's fair to contrast you as sort of the solid citizen guy and he's a bit of the wild child?
tenniswise how much do you think he's improved? and compare the two of you and both of your progress.
there is a lot of talk about nick on court, swearing on court, the antics and everything. is it easy to keep your focus with other guys...
is it easy to block it out?
what are the elements of his game that you find most challenging?
is this a big match, in your mind?
where are you on the continuum of the surgery to queen's club to two matches here now?
how was your foot today? do you generally feel pangs here and there?
less this time than in your first match, or there's not that quick change?
do you need painkillers?
do you like playing on grass?
i think you clocked the thirdfastest serve today in wimbledon history. is there any significance to you? and how much more do you think you can tap into your power?
the patch you were wearing on your sleeve, is that part of the deal with tennis canada?
is this the same injury you had in germany, in halle, correct? how did you make the decision that it was too bad to keep going today?
do you know more specifically what the injury is? is it a muscle tear or anything like that? what can you say about it?
at the end of your last match you kind of threw a fist pump in the air that looked a bit tired. did you know then, at the end of the match, things were going to be pretty tough for you the next couple of days?
what does this tournament mean to you and how disappointed do you feel?
do you know what your plan is now? are you going back to the states or back to japan?
have you spoken to michael yet?
has your bad luck with injuries made you more cautious now when something comes up like this, to choose on the side of being more careful?
how do you assess that? looked a little bit flat early. heard talk about a headache. were you ill out there at all?
he's a former top20 player. doing it in three sets, must be pleased the way you're going?
raonic next. how is that considering what happened here last year?
when you have a physical issue you're dealing with, what effect does the fan base have for you?
how bad was it coming back after beating nadal and playing against raonic?
there was a moment in the first set that you told the fanatics it was not the best time to be singing. does that distract you, the noise?
right at the end.
what happened with the linesman? what was said to the umpire at the end of the first set?
last year against raonic you said you ran out of petrol basically at the end. your endurance these days, how do you feel about that?
much talk about the heat today. what sort of effects did you find from that?
are you aware you're swearing quite loudly, and that's what makes the line judge talk to the umpire, or are you not realizing it?
are you aware of sort of what you're saying and how loudly you're swearing, given i think that's what prompted the line judge to go to the umpire and say, say to him you just said this.
i'm saying the reason...
what did the chair umpire say to you?
apart from the serve with milos, what's the most difficult part of his game? is it return?
you said you knew what you have to do against him. what is that?
have you got a feeling you could have a good year here?
there are so many preconceptions about guys with big serves. everyone says guys with big serves should be going deep. and the courts have slowed down some. we all know that. what are the advantages or what makes it tough for a big guy to go deep at a tournament here?
do you feel like you have the advantage?
do you feel as though you should have had better results here? you have had particular circumstances, obviously.
including even injury one year, etcetera.
do you look at it as, gee, i should have better results?
novak djokovic was just asked to sort of go through the different strokes: forehand, backhand, return, so forth, talked about who had the toughest strokes he's faced in his career. could you take a minute and just think about what are the toughest strokes you've faced?
and mental toughness?
and finally, volley?
for a guy from where you're from, what was the heat like today?
what did you make of all the talk leading up to today, given that it seems here in the uk they are just not used to temperatures in the mid 90s or low 90s?
with tomic and kyrgios and some other guys who have been in action from australia, the aussie fans are out in strength. what has been your experience, if any, with aussie fans that has maybe struck your memory bank?
you mentioned court 18. how often have you had the chance to walk by the plaque that's there for your match and seen people posing, taking pictures? and what goes through your mind when you see that?
you said you were lucky not to play any australians in australia. what is the role of luck in this sport, in tennis?
can you think of a let cord or a draw that was really good or bad luck?
you have mentioned you don't know who your next opponent will be, but if it's cilic, how would you describe his game and his evolution into the champion he is?
there was an incident on court today with the ball boy. did you see what happened? did it disrupt you?
how many marks would you give yourself out of 10 for your performance today?
is there anything you do on grass that's better than on any other surface?
you play bernard tomic next. the aussie fanatics are out in full force. have you ever found them distracting or funny?
what are your thoughts on it?
how did you find the effect of the heat today?
what exactly are you expecting from bernard when you play?
you didn't celebrate after match point. you went to hug jarkko nieminen, which is sporting. why did you feel you wanted to do that?
there are a huge number of stats available now. i'm wondering how much you look at those stats to help you prepare for your matches.
match stats.
going back to navratilova, so many great champions have gotten warm, wonderful adulation in defeat. you had that incredible round of applause at roland garros. what were your thoughts at the moment, and now that you've had time to reflect on it, what are your thoughts on that match?
you've been on the tour for more than 10 years now. of all the opponents you've played, what is the best area of someone's game you played against, whether it be a forehand, backhand, and why?
that's two very solid wins now. how do you feel you're playing? and obviously given you did so well here last year, how close do you feel you are to that form?
he's one of those players where, when he's hot, he's almost unplayable.
does it feel sort of good to actually be back here where you did so well last year? it's not been as convincing a season for you this year, has it, compared to last year?
about a year and a half ago boris becker told me you would be the next greatest player provided you did not get distracted. have you got too distracted by other things and that you haven't fulfilled mr. becker's great promise?
you can amplify if you like.
you have never beaten richard before in all your matches. what makes his game tough for you? and how much does that play in your mind going into the next one?
where would you rank his backhand compared to other players? it's one of the better ones.
can you talk about this black new racquet? is it a prototype?
is it the same model of roger?
no?
tell me if i'm wrong, but have you tried in rotterdam a new model already?
are you looking for something with the racquet?
i appreciate you are asked a lot about maria. is there any kind of practical advantage to having her in your team at a tournament like this? do you analyze games together or anything of that nature?
are there any examples you can give?
what was the heat like on the court? what are your thoughts in general on what the heat can do to the players out there?
were your expectations different? you said it didn't feel that hot. did you expect it to be worse?
(question about roger rasheed.)
have you and maria played in consecutive games on the same court before, and did you get a chance to watch her?
you wouldn't do that?
why not?
i mean, you would have had the chance to go after your match just now to go and watch her play.
didn't fancy it?
what are your thoughts on how you got through today?
when john isner was in this room earlier and he was asked about playing against you. he said the thing that he's most impressed is your calmness on the court, that you never get angry about anything. how would you describe the way you've developed that quality and its importance to your success?
what do you foresee in a matchup with isner?
what has the us open championship meant to the time since then? in these months since and even going into wimbledon, what do you draw from having won that us open?
did you feel that getting away from you a little the moment it went?
when you were broke first game second set, i think that was a bit of a turning point.
the way you removed your shirt, what is that?
what is the story behind that?
why those?
how long did it take?
have you enjoyed the limelight the last couple days, feeding off the crowd?
any unusual requests or anything happen the last couple days?
what about the next few hours and days, what have you got lined up?
playing mixed doubles with naomi?
is that another sofa in pittsburgh?
i saw your sister was there today. was your dad there today?
back to the travel and stuff. what is the longest since you've been on the tour that you've stayed in one place?
one house even.
does it get to you?
right at the end someone shouted, finish him off. you looked like you enjoyed that.
your beard actually has a twitter account.
are you planning to keep it?
does this drive you on, the experience of the last three or four days, drive you on to achieve even more here next year?
bbc have compared your beard to marty smith in form. is that an insult?
he was from manchester.
in the middle of the second set, you gave us an interview halfway through, i'm just not making my first serve. what's going on?
seemed you needed to lose that first set, kicked you into life, never looked back after that?
made some good challenges, particularly in the last two sets. could you sense then...
real rapport going with the crowd. you would like to be on one of the show courts for round two.
is there a real satisfaction, sort of changing the dynamic of the match in your own mind, when he pulled out, somebody you wanted to have a go at, he was a lucky loser.
four british men into the second round. i believe it's the first time in 10 years we've had that. does that give you an extra sense of pride?
is there any reason? you say people are picking up their game. any reason you can fathom for that?
how much did your super performance in the davis cup give you the selfconfidence to do what you did today?
slightly different track. three years since you were in the second round. since then arsenal have won a couple trophies as well.
any striker in particular?
physically, how are you after that?
just managing it?
you spoke about it at queen's. obviously you want to do well. davis cup, second singles place, a couple weeks ago way. you still confident that that is yours?
how would you describe how you're feeling on court and your level of confidence right now?
and the level of confidence you're feeling?
were you checking the stats of the match? if yes, what do you usually look at?
you look at stats right after the match?
what about your serve, rafa? a new motion. were you happy with your serve today?
twice.
you play dustin brown next. he said he played the match of his life against you last year. what do you expect from him? what is it like playing a guy like him, who is a grass court specialist?
how is the grass feeling this year? it's hotter. does it feel different to last year?
brown is said to be the fastest player between points. you like to take your time. does that make a difference when you play against a player who is quick between points?
in terms of the conditions outside, how did you find them, the heat? it's going to get hotter throughout the week.
the women get a break between the second and third if they wish to. if the temperatures were to hit 35, 36 degrees later on this week, would you like to see the men getting a heat break as well? is that something you would be in favor of?
you change the style of your clothes quite a few times during the year. you've been playing for a long time. what do you do with the old outfits when you move on to the next outfit?
after the disappointment of roland garros, you've responded well by winning stuttgart. did it come as a surprise the way you played? are you playing well now? did you expect that?
how does it feel to be a no.10 seed at wimbledon this year? you'll get tougher games in the early stages. you played a player in the top 50 today. does it feel tougher being a lowerranked player than when you're one of the top seeds?
do you have a favorite outfit from all the years? maybe the longer ones or something that you like?
that didn't quite go as you had hoped?
you seemed to show your exasperation at the end of the second set with the overrule of the umpire. that seemed to get at you and hurt you.
did you feel any home support out there, or you felt like you never got anything going to get the crowd behind you?
was the heat an issue for you?
there is another round to go, and he could be meeting murray in the third round. do you think he could trouble him with that solid game?
how long did it take for the fans, british fans, to see you as british? it's only been a couple of years since the nationality changed. do you think it will take a while for them to recognize you as...
do you think it might have been better if you played a bit later, before when they had taken their seats? first up, people come in later?
did it have an effect on your preparation?
you have been based over here a couple years now. you were close to breaking the top 100 in 2013 or so. how would you assess how you've done the last couple of years and going forward now what you can do the rest of this year?
do you remember the last time you played murray at the u.s. and you won the third set 61? what were your feelings about that match? did you think you went in there and maybe could have won?
how surprised were you to see him suffering so much physically in that match? he has a reputation as being one of the great athletes on tour. he seemed to really struggle.
how do you feel about the challenge of playing him at wimbledon? it will be different with the grass court.
i think you have played each other five times as professionals. i know you're both the same age. would you have played each other coming through the youth ranks at all?
do you see any weakness in andy's game that you would target in the match? i mean, the serve, perhaps?
are you the sort of player who relishes when you're up against the home crowd? do you respond to that?
the conditions this week, hot and fast. you have a good serve. do you feel that gives you an even better chance?
how do you assess your form at the moment? you had good results coming in and a good win today.
what are your memories of playing here as a junior? you got to the final, didn't you?
what are your memories of that? how special is wimbledon to you because of that?
chardy?
do you think you can gain anything from the fact andy has so much pressure on him here whereas you can go out and play freely with nothing to lose?
how are you finding the grass this year? is it any different from last year the way it's playing based on your experience so far?
do you find that it varies from year to year in general?
you played on centre court here quite a few times. can you in one single word describe what emotion that keeps coming back to you when you walk on the court here?
to what degree do you draw satisfaction from having defied anybody who said years ago, he's got this amount of time left, he's close to the end?
staying at homes is what a lot of players do when they come to wimbledon. if you have in the past, why is that an advantage, especially with a growing family, that feeling at home and playing at wimbledon?
do you have to do any of the cleaning yourself?
you come onto centre court you've played so many times, you get a standing ovation, dominate the match. do you allow yourself to ever feel sympathy for your opponent or do you stay in a ruthless mode? are you conscious of that?
are you concerned at all what happens to the profile of men's tennis after you and rafa and novak and andy stop playing in a few years' time?
there's been a few interesting stories circulating about novak djokovic and boris becker, claims and stories that they have oncourt coaching when they've been playing matches. is this something you've noticed playing novak? is it more prevalent? what is your opinion on it?
or any player?
it has?
can you go into more detail for me?
a question about the color code here.
you suggested it's quite strict here. what color would you like to use, what style would you like to wear here if you could?
do you already know what you'd like to do after your career, which areas you'd like to research?
the wimbledon experience is sort of a combination of very special moments. you've had so many. speak about your favorite moments here and how they might compare with each other.
you've spoken about how wonderful it is to come here when there's a real quiet and a hush.
which moments do you most prefer?
how did you find the conditions out there today with the heat? did it affect you at all?
it's said to maybe reach 35, 36 through this week. in terms of the heat rule that the women get, is that something you've thought of, something you'd like to see introduced?
five years ago here in the first round you lost the first two sets to falla. since then you haven't lost a set in a firstround match in a major. you haven't even been pushed in most of the sets. did that match change anything for you? was that just one tough opponent on one tough day?
talk about what happened with the injury. looked like you were having your shoulder treated. anything related to the stomach? both problems?
you're getting used to the experience, more play at wimbledon. how did you find it today? people maybe know you a bit more. how frustrating is it not to be able to get that win here?
you're 101 this week. you've been thereabouts for a while. is it a mental barrier?
how did the heat affect your game today?
is your shoulder going to be okay for the davis cup?
am i right in thinking there was a suggestion you might play higher up in the order of the davis cup ahead of ward? is that correct?
how much of a shortterm target is it to qualify by right for the main draw at the us open? how realistic do you think it is?
just to be specific, as far as you are concerned, you are 100% fit without any ab, shoulder, whatever problems when you walked onto court?
how much did you see of liam's match yesterday? how much do the two of you spur each other on as the two main british men coming through?
you said it's hot for london. do you think the heat rules should be made available to male players considering it will be hotter tomorrow?
female players, they can call for a stop for 10 minutes between the second and third set. do you think it should be available to the men, considering it will be 35 tomorrow.
31
so what could you see at the end? how much could you see?
enough?
the first set went, you know, quite straightforward, and then suddenly he seemed really up for it.
were you confident it would be one won in four and you would get it done tonight?
of course you wanted to, but did you think you would?
i had a chat with your physio, per. can you talk a little bit about your work with him? you started out last fall, i believe? what type of guy he is and also what the work you have done together has meant for your game.
but, i mean, not to talk too much of your age, but you're not the youngest tennis player anymore. but do you still feel like you can put on at some things on your physical condition? is it even more important now than when you were young and you could maybe keep a lot of things going?
i'm curious about the physics of how you do this. you don't have the flexibility of a djokovic, your explosive in a different way than some of the other guys. can you talk about where that power comes from? is it trunk rotation?
what did you feel during the match? what was the part of his game that gave you a little bit more trouble?
tell us a little bit more about your positioning while returning. you have a specific way of positioning yourself when you return on clay courts. you're almost the opposite of everybody else. here you're in a different position.
has your mentality switched at this wimbledon from previous attempts where now you might be expected to progress to the latter stages and possibly win it?
you're now one of the big four.
you're not?
you're one of the big four, yes, now?
because everybody in tennis talks about the four.
why aren't you already one of them?
current form, though, surely.
if it was this year, are you one of the big four?
you mentioned the other day that your game has clicked on grass. what fell into place for you? why has your game improved on grass over the earlier years when you struggled?
what are the main adaptations in your game that maybe you didn't feel comfortable with on grass before?
you won admiration for your shorts almost as much as your tennis at the french open. would you welcome any change to the allwhite rule at wimbledon?
richard krajicek on the radio thought you had a problem with your thigh?
severin said that you're the barbecue king here in wimbledon. can you confirm or deny that?
you're a numbers guy.
b, c+, or how would you grade it?
what about the little sort of hiccup in the third set?
in a match like that, did you feel the serve was locked in from the beginning, or does it take some time...
do you have to get into bestoffiveset mode? because you missed the french, so it's been like four months since you played well?
the court didn't seem that fast for some reason.
is it juicy, or what do you think it is?
do you like old guys? do you like playing old guys?
a lot of people think he's a very nice player to watch. when you were coming up, did you ever watch him and enjoy watching the way he plays?
yeah, he did.
there is no name for it.
the tournament was called that.
maybe you could talk a little bit about your calf because that was a problem for you in halle. how is it feeling and how much did it impact your performance today?
coming into a slam where you don't have as good of success on grass as you do on the other surfaces, does it make you more motivated to perform well here or does it make you more anxious or unsettled?
do you think maybe you're continually improving on the surface? each year you come here, it's like first round, third round, fourth round. is that a good sign for this year, maybe you might go even further?
is the injury a concern going forward to your next match at all?
you said you were getting more confidence on the grass now. i was wondering if there is anything you need to do in your game maybe, i don't know, adapting or strokes to match the success you've had, say, at the us open or the australian? anything specifically you're working on?
nice start to the tournament?
what was it like going back on to the same court where you play richard last year?
do you enjoy the support you get, the aussies?
was it tough to hold your control, fell back 42, had a talk with the umpire?
you seem like a different force on grass.
it seems to suit your weapons. is it your favorite surface?
after you had that discussion with the umpire, you seemed to say 'dirty scum' out loud. what was that about?
do you fear you might be now fined for saying something like that? what would be your reaction to that?
you were talking about basketball the other day. did you see the nba championships?
could you talk about what you could learn from lebron and what you can learn from steph curry or the warriors?
what aspect of the warriors don't you like?
this time last year you were 144 in the world. where do you think your game has improved?
why did you refer to yourself as dirty scum?
it was an interesting thing to call yourself.
back to the basketball. in that article where you were talking about enjoying watching it, you also said you liked to play it a lot. you liked watching nba better than tennis. what would you do to change tennis and make it more of something that would appeal on tv?
after that incident with the umpire, you spoke to someone. what was said to you about the call?
what did he say to you there?
like you said, this is just your second main draw here. you haven't had that many main draws in all the slams yet. you have two quarterfinal appearances. how experienced do you feel you are? when you come here, do you still feel you don't have that much experience?
we a strong contingent of australians this year. how does that make the feel of the tournament feel?
the contingent, biggest since '95 here at wimbledon. what do you put that down to? is it the way they restructured, players were developed? have you capitalized on that, benefited from that?
for guys and your generation, what does hewitt mean to you and the other players that are your age?
any words of advice taking on richard today?
does it worry you that your reputation now is becoming a little bit feisty on court, that australia has players that are a little bit more calm, that you might be seen as becoming the bad boy of australian tennis?
on the other hand, do you think in your own heart you bring a charisma or style that is appealing to young fans?
like draymond green?
i'm just teasing. you were talking about lebron and how he does what he does, he doesn't care. do you sort of look at basketball, people like that, as a role model rather than people who are perhaps higher up the ladder in tennis?
in terms of your style and your swagger or whatever.
top basketball players and the way they carry themselves are very different to the top tennis players. do you see yourself leaning more towards the basketball side?
what do you make of your performance today?
obviously you had a little bit of an illness coming into this week?
it was pretty warm today, as well.
are you still okay to play doubles with lleyton?
how seriously are you taking that? do you think you will get deep in the draw?
how important are the doubles in terms of davis cup?
is that part of the plan? have you spoken with lleyton or he spoken to you about potentially playing doubles in the davis cup quarterfinals?
you said you're a bit pissed off after the game. you had a couple of smashes, second set. was it tough to handle your emotions today, as well?
did you notice the ball boy go down, right before the first set tiebreak?
did you get sick at all during the week?
another illness? was it more to it?
what do you remember from lleyton's wimbledon win? you were six.
what did that achievement mean to you as you got older?
do you think his role has been an important part of this generation of australian players that you have now? i know you were young when he won that, but beyond that?
do you give him a shot if he plays novak?
were there any moments that you thought you might be able to win it when it was going well?
do you feel especially in the first set there were opportunities that slipped away from you?
did it seem as though he had a little bit of rust, or did you think he was on his a game today?
if it had to end, it would have been in a fighting spirit that you showed out there today.
when does it start hitting you that you've played your last wimbledon singles match?
coming in here, did you reflect much on the journey from when you first came here till this final tournament?
to get as far as you do in professional sport, i assume you have to be pretty ruthless and hardnosed. are you an emotional kind of guy? do you cry easily?
the great champions here have so many great moments, of the walking out on centre court or returning each year or lifting the trophy. if you could share with us one or two moments that were really special for you.
is there a sense that something can never be taken from you?
what is the process of deciding that your career is over and accepting the fact that you have to move on and find something else? how do you deal with this journey?
could you tell us a little bit more about what it was like sitting there. you said you went to centre court yesterday. were you alone? what were you picturing or thinking about sitting there?
you've been right through the whole journey. we have a whole crop of young kids coming up now. what's the key advice you would give to those kids coming through at the moment?
when you look at yourself today, when you look at the guy with the hair that won the thing, which of the two do you like better?
when you burst onto the scene as a kid, you had to put up with the pressure of the media and the public saying, this kid is not the way the old players used to be. the young players coming through now, kyrgios, bernie, they're going through that as well. what kind of advice do you tell them off the court to stick through it?
you're handing over the baton. is there one of them that you feel is one that is going to follow in your footsteps?
how aware are the kids of this occasion now? have they said anything to you? with the ashes coming up and also the british open golf, are you looking forward to seeing any of those events?
your career spans generations in the game. from your perspective, what was the best shot of any player you played against and why, best area of the game?
you just talked about how easy it is at the age of 34 to retire. today tommy haas won a match at the age of 37. can you understand somebody who is coming back on tour at that age?
your final wimbledon press conference without mentioning your aussies. are you going to miss them as much as we're going to miss you?
it's human nature to think i might have done this or that a little differently. if you could have changed something in your career, what comes to mind as something you might have changed?
what does it say about the competitor in you that you went out 119 in the fifth set and weren't prepared to fade into the sunset?
without naming names, can the same be said of every player on the circuit at the moment?
is there any advice that you tell your kids now that you learned from your parents, since they were a big part in your career?
i happened to be in the press office earlier when a rather surprised official took a phone call from a rather elderly english lady about your aussie fans saying she was disgusted by their behavior, they hope they're going to do something about the way they sing. is there a kind of message you could give to people in this country that don't understand the way the aussies do their thing?
you worked in commentary the last couple years. is that something that's going to take a more forward step?
can you put into words what wimbledon means to you, why it's so special.
did you feel any rust? i didn't see any.
the other day you told us about the communication between you and boris in the box, more kind of an encouragement thing. now i've seen footage where he's talked about using hand signals, the serbian members of your team shouting out things in serbian, which fewer people are going to understand.
we know very well that in the past, rafa nadal, for instance, and uncle toni have been pulled up for this. i am interested this in general, and just at the french open, we were asking rafa about why a particular umpire wasn't with him, about the whole issue of time violations. it just so happens now it appears twice in the last three weeks, say, boris has been talking about how he communicates with you on court. i'm only responding to what i've seen and heard.
because we keep finding examples of boris saying it.
there's another instance. anyway...
do you think you know better where your game is after a tough round like this? and were you talking to that bird on the court?
this is lleyton hewitt's last wimbledon. he might be your next opponent. can you talk about how strange it might be knowing, if you beat him, it's going to be his last match here. must be a strange situation.
did you discuss in advance of today's match with boris the thing about signals, not to do it? was that subject discussed in advance of the game?
were there any signals or anything today or words in serbian?
as you left, it seemed as though a lady gave you a cd or something.
what was that about?
videos?
i was wondering what your sense is of why you think roger federer has been so durable, and then at the other side with rafa, his injuries in recent years, what your thoughts are about their longevity moving forward over the next year or two?
back to the bird. did you ever fear for its safety? it got close to the tram lines at one point. did you recognize the species? in the press box, we didn't have a very good view. wonder if you could help identify which one it was.
yes.
i want to know if you are going to play in the tie against luxembourg.
so you still have to play one tie for the olympics.
your first wimbledon as a grand slam champion. does it feel different?
for example, what kind of things?
did it take you long to get used to being a grand slam champion?
such an amazing thing.
continuing that theme, you do seem a more confident person on court since the us open?
does having an extra week on grass make any difference? will it make any difference in the results? with djokovic, for instance, he didn't play a tournament. do you think it will have an impact?
what about you?
how do you feel your form is now? obviously getting back after your long layoff, do you feel you're getting back to your best now?
you had a good wimbledon last year. do you feel this is now becoming your surface, as well, a good surface for you?
you may have seen that djokovic was asked if boris becker gave him some signals during play. does your coach give you any signals?
often when you win a grand slam, it's an aftermath of figuring out what comes next. are you still going through that aftermath, or have you worked your way through that? do you have all the cobwebs that...
how long did that take to get back to kind of getting rid of all the aftermath of winning the open? getting on with your playing?
after your layoff, are you back to full fitness now? the match in stuttgart, did that take much out of you?
a few hours ago now, but a fantastic performance and comeback from you. talk us through it.
was there a specific point in the match where you thought it was really coming your way, you could feel it?
what does it mean to you to win your first grand slam match?
you obviously had experience playing here before in the juniors. what was the difference playing in the main draw in the seniors here?
talk a bit about the help that andy murray has been to you. you practiced a lot with him. i don't know if you've been out to miami.
your sister naomi came to watch your match. how does it feel to win your first match at wimbledon without the support of your dad? will you be able to see him later watching your sister play, and will you sit with him if you see him later?
do you think this win might kind of make your family come back together?
what did you think about the warning you were given? you had some comments to make at the time.
been a while coming in here. how have you physically fronted up after your first fiveset match? any kind of physical issues?
how much does this make up for all the sacrifices that you make on tour, all the hotel rooms in uzbekistan, all the hard yards you put in in the winter?
you mentioned that you were swearing. there's been quite a lot of discussion in social media since your match that the umpire was mic'd up for it. did you know that?
on the plus side, as well as getting through, it's a 47,000 paycheck. is that something to treat yourself with or go down a hole?
did your dad text you? has he communicated any congratulations?
did he even watch the game?
47,000, which equals almost your entire career, have you slept on friend's floors or what it's like sometimes?
the first day of the first week, you pulled off this kind of result. what do you think it does for the feelgood thing?
how long have you had the beard?
how important did you feel it was today to show everybody your improvement and hard work?
how much of a step up is the next round going to be?
yes.
does belief from today come into that?
does this fantastic win help vindicate your decision to go back inhouse with the lta? that must have been quite difficult.
when you have a win like this, you come up against a seed like you touched on, how do you review that? a reward for the hard work?
did you say a speech in glasgow at the davis cup?
has leon given any indication that you'll have a part to play in the preparations, at least, for the davis cup?
on the second round, obviously a big chance to be on a show court of some kind. how do you view that?
nice familiar feeling?
getting to be familiar, though.
was it a case of playing smarter tennis in the conditions?
don't play many guys like that, do you?
seemed to go cross-court a lot to his forehand.  was that a strategy, keep him on the forehand court?
does it mean that much more when you do win it in straight sets every single match?  does that have an emphatic meaning to you, as well?
the organizers of  the open say it's going to cost $200 million to get it up to standards.  what do you think of the standard of the australian open as opposed to other grand slams?
$200 million.
to improve the standard of the facilities.
are you aware of that 'genius' banner that follows you around tournament to tournament?
what does that word mean to you, "genius"?
work or talent?
how surprised or relieved were you to take that first set?  was that what you felt was the turning point?
would you remember how to come from a set down?
have you booked a clay court for practice tomorrow?
of all the streaks you have going, what sticks out in your mind as the most impressive to you?
at the start of the match, the emcee is going through your list of achievements.  would you prefer that happened or didn't happen?  two grand slams there's no announcements, and the other two they announce everything you've done.  would you rather go out incognito and play, or read this list of achievements?
do you think a match like this, if kids could see a match like this, that it would inspire them how you two played such different tennis from what we're used to with the baseline grinders, beautiful tennis with one-handed backhands?  do you think maybe we can get some kids thinking about playing that way, too?
fernando is strong as a bull.  looked like the middle of the second set he was kind of sucking wind, having trouble keeping up.  seemed to move around exceptionally well.
inevitably we'll talk about the slam.  how much does that live in your mind?
is the slam an achievable target?
would you say your motivation is as strong now as it's ever been to play and to win?
after which level, what do you think another tennis player think about roger federer after this?
yes.  what do you think?  you are unbeatable?  it is impossible to play against you?
are you confirming that you're not going to retire next year like borg did when he was 26?  if you have a bad year, winning only two slams per year, that means in five years you will have 20.
what makes rafa so hard to beat for you on clay?  i mean, nadal.
it almost seems sometimes your status as a person in tennis, ambassador for the game, is the only competition you have as a player in the game.  your status as a person is rising, the only thing rising as fast as your status as a player.  is that meaningful for you?
the affection people feel for you, the ambassadorship.
have you ever played anybody so hot like that before?
what was it like for you just being there at the end of that?
what did jimmy say to you straight after the game?
you seem really disappointed.  did you think you had a real crack tonight, a chance?
is that the best you've seen him play for a while?
can you just take us from 4-all on.  up to 4-4, you're in the match.  then you got broken.
i saw that.  on court, what changed from 4-all till the end?
how do you go forward from here?  how do you counter a game like that?
how do you rate haas or gonzlez' chances against him?
is he getting better?  is he getting progressively better?
yes.
you said this week that you thought the gap between you and roger was closing, or at least wasn't getting any wider.
the next time you feel that, will you keep it to yourself?
beating safin and ancic, was this a good tournament?
obviously he played great.  did you feel like you needed to play much better?
did you think about trying to slow things down there in the second set when he started to get a run?
how much would you have paid in order not to come too this press conference tonight?
what next?  davis cup preparation?
what does that involve?  a bit of experience on clay?
what did jimmy say?  us open final experience, you played him tough, got on a roll.  did you talk about that before the match, if roger gets on a roll, try to do x, y or z, slow it down?
will you try to maybe totally forget about this result and just put it aside?
do you then study it and learn from it, force yourself to work out what to do next?
some people don't read the papers when they lose the next day.  will you read it, or you prefer not?
how would you write it if you had to write it?
that match.
write it.
how would you write it?  i was talking fast.
sort of two steps forward, one step back, but you're moving in the right direction?
your performance here is better than on court.
right.
how do you see the haas/gonzlez game going?  what do you make of fernando's performance at this tournament?
do you rate him perhaps as a chance against roger under the circumstances?
after a night like this, do you sleep well?
where are you going after this?
second set, was that the best tennis you've ever played, or close to it?
we kind of asked this question after the djokovic match.  was there a bit of an extra edge out there?  you really wanted to make your statement and play your best in these circumstances against someone who has come close to you in the last couple times that you played?
you said on court that you were shocked.  how would you be shocked if your name was andy roddick or jimmy connors?
what advice would you give him after a demoralizing loss like that?
you must be feeling 10 feet tall and bulletproof right now.
have you ever felt better?
what puts you into that zone?  what gets you there?
it was a wonderful response from the crowd, a standing ovation.  you musn't get too one step ahead of yourself.  you still have a final to play and that's great, but it was a tremendous ovation, wasn't it?
you've been talking to rod laver.  what did he say about the match?
he didn't rate your performance today?
if you have a time machine, which legend would you pick to play against you, from the history of tennis?
some people think it won't make a difference.  who would you prefer out of the other side facing on sunday?
have you seen the gonzlez matches?  will you watch tomorrow night or leave that to someone like tony roche?
will you watch tomorrow night?
there were a couple of moments when the giant screen showed replays of one or two of your superior efforts tonight.  the crowd had a great response.  do you look up as well and think, how did i do that?
you beat 6-0, 7-6, 6-0 lleyton hewitt at the us open.  how do you compare that win with the win of tonight?  similar or not?  secondly, if you were a writer --
roddick was saying that he was closing the gap.  now we are all thinking this gap became the grand canyon, the pacific ocean.  what do you think it is?
lleyton hewitt.
you've never won a slam without dropping a set.  will you think of it on sunday?
what do you think is the legacy you're giving to the game?
for the past four years you've probably given 500 press conference.  is there a question that none of us has ever asked you that you'd like to answer?
rod laver said today before the match that you're on your way to becoming the greatest player of all time.  he also said that you're a modest champion.  is there something you can possibly say that could argue against those who don't believe you're actually the greatest yet?  are there things you need to achieve?
what do you think about the impact of your coach tony roche and the impact of jimmy connors with roddick in today's match?
is your father going to be allowed to come to more grand slam tournaments?
you talk about your coach.  what are the members of your team?  can you talk more about the nutritionist?
apart from the win, what pleased you most about the match?
how is your form now compared with five years ago, last making the semifinal here?
will you watch this match now?
at one stage you called for the trainer on your right thigh.  what was the story?
you also seemed to have something irritating your eyes.
could you not see the ball when you were playing?
you were having quite a conversation with yourself at one point when it looked pretty grim.  nikolay said he thought you were going nuts.  were you going nuts?
when was the last time you played a fifth set that well?
do you feel like you might have snuck under the radar a little bit so far in the tournament?
can you use anything from the memories of the previous two semifinal appearances this time?
what do you mean you laid down?
you laid down in the locker room.
do you feel like this result is a long time coming, given everything you've been through, this level of play?
your thoughts on your potential opponent in the semifinal.
last year, 2-all in the fifth with roger, when you look back at that match, what do you think happened?
nikolay said in his press conference he thought you had a good chance in the semifinal, but he also said you wouldn't be able to go away like you did for the second and third sets and have a chance to win in the semis.
if it is rafa, did you watch murray the other night?
very emotional at the end of the match.  do you think it's a stronger feeling than the last time, last semifinal here?
is that the way you treat your friends?
he said that's the best you've ever played against him.  agreed?
yes.
you came into the tournament with good form.  you've had some great games up till now.  any chance of peaking too early?
at the end you weren't celebrating.  were you almost embarrassed for him or you didn't want to show him up?
how much better is it to go into a semifinal after a match like that than the el aynaoui match?
(indiscernible) a little more because you didn't get the court time today?
any aspects of your game that you feel you need to improve on heading into the semis?
mardy has given you a great shot against roger.  break down the match-up.
have you ever had only four unforced errors in a match?
you are supposed to play roger in the semi.  do you enjoy it?
match points in shanghai.  you beat him in kooyong.  do you feel that gives you confidence?
what were your misgivings way back when the process started about whether jimmy would work out for you?  how have things sort of worked out in sort of what your reservations may have been way back when?
why do you think mardy caved in so easily?
in your next match against roger --
in your match with roger.
yes, against roger.
no, he hasn't.  if he does win, you play roger in the next round, are you going to be doing something different in your game plan, or are you going to do what you do best basically?
if roger does go down tonight, how will that affect your preparation for the semi?  any change?
do you think sometimes the media exaggerates on the importance of the coach?
what is the percentage of the influence of a coach on a tennis match or career?
tennis is an individual sport.  do you think a coach is more important in a team effort or for an individual?
in team sports normally there is a strategy that involves 11 players or 15.
what did you and mardy have to say at the net?
is there a fine line to walk with attacking roger and not getting away from your base sometimes?
can you read his serve better now?
does it being a night match factor at all?
the fact that you played marat in such a hyped up match sort of help out going into another big one?
how much did the windy conditions affect your game?
what was the difference between the two of you?  there were three tight sets.
you came in with such good form.  is there a mental pressure on you when you face up to a guy like roger?  are you intimidated by him?
mardy, take us through what happened.
you know andy so well.  do you feel a jimmy connors' effect in his game?
besides the serve, do you feel him putting pressure on you at other points in the game?
the way andy is playing, do you think he can go all the way this year?
what did you talk about up at the net when it was all over?
before we didn't give too much importance to the coach.  now sometimes you have the impression even players give maybe too much importance to the coach.  what is the right size?  how important is martin for you?  how important is connors for roddick?
what is it going to take?  this is your first time at this level.  what is it going to take for you to build on this and come back strong, do better the next time?
you know andy really well.  i know he's played roger tough last couple times.  he goes into the match 1-12 against a guy.  can he really go out there with a lot of confidence?
you mentioned you considered andy like a brother.  does that make it easier or harder?
what happens next?  do you have the kind of relationship where you two can have a laugh about it, or will it become the match that doesn't get mentioned for a couple of months?
in terms of confidence, do you put more stock into andy getting close to beating roger in shanghai or the xo?
what kind of respect do you have for the wheelchair tennis here in melbourne park?
from thursday.
will you talk to andy or make him buy you dinner or will it take a couple days for this thing to get over?
did you lose a bit of energy after those two five-setters, do you feel?
did it feel okay at the start and just got worse?
is there something in his game that you don't like?
what is your emotion having won that match?
are you relieved that you won?
did you expect him to be as good and to last five sets as he did?
what did he do well tonight?
did he surprise you with the amount of times he came to the net?
did you feel you would have an advantage when it goes five sets because you are so fit?
you've won grand slams.  do you think andy can do the same?
how good do you think he can be?
what do you think was the difference today?  what made the difference between you winning and him not winning?
was it cold out there?
you finished strong in the last two sets.  that seemed to coincide with your first serves picking up.  did that give you more confidence?
i was asking whether that gave you the extra confidence to push hard in the last two sets.
can i ask about your next opponent, fernando gonzlez.
what about the way he plays compared to the way andy murray played you tonight?
so many emotions going around in your head at the moment, disappointment, frustration.  the way you played was just tremendous.
are you proud of yourself?
(question regarding tactics.)
in the second set, you went for your side.  did you have a problem there?
now that you've played him firsthand, what is it that makes him so difficult to play against?
you were saying your side didn't affect you, but did it affect your concentration at that point?  you went through a spell where your level seemed to dip at the end of the second, beginning of the third.
anything about his game, playing him in a real match situation, anything surprising to you?
beat federer last year.  took some other scalps.  do you think tonight was even a higher standard?
do you think you went places and discovered things about yourself tonight?
is the overwhelming feeling of pride in your performance or disappointment you couldn't win the match?
leaving aside the results, was the experience of being out there in a night match, rod laver, against a big player, everything that you thought it would be?
is this the start of a new rivalry?
you're going to be probably knocking on the door of the top 10 come the next rankings.  you've played almost all of them; beaten most of them.  do you feel this is where you belong, that you are a top 10 player?
why do you think of your generation he's the one who has done things first, had the big achievements first at the age he has?
what did he say to you at the end of the match?
what is next?  where do you go from here?
you mixed up the pace a fair bit, kept the ball deep on either side.  that is the optimum way of playing nadal in a match?
you've now won all three matches against nalbandian.  why do you think you have the advantage over him?
what pleased you most about today's match?
tell us about the match.
what was going through your mind when you had him love-40 and match points?
you must be very happy.
third seed, in the quarterfinals, you haven't played on center court yet.  does that disappoint you?
you think the tournament has ignored you a little?
playing so many matches, does a day off throw you off?
did you fit a honeymoon in between?
does your wife like tennis?
can you talk about tommy haas for us.
do you feel good about playing tommy?  do you feel confident?
which court are you expecting?
which court do you expect to play on?
do you take special pleasure from meeting guys who have big game?
tomas, for instance.  such a difference between you.  they hit the ball a ton, serve big.  does it give you special satisfaction to be able to take those guys out with the kind of game you have?
kafelnikov was known for playing many games in a year.  is that why you also play many games?
do you get bored when you're not playing?
why do you think nikolay davydenko has to wait till the middle of the second week to play on the main court?
three very tight sets.  what was the difference between you and your opponent?
do you feel like you ran into a buzz saw with the way he's playing today?
did you feel at all lethargic?
how different was it to play outdoors after being inside so much?
what's the biggest difference with fernando in terms of the player that you used to run into a few years ago and the player he is now, in terms of temperament, you know, how he goes about business?
how do you assess his chances in the tournament?
did you feel that you had a chance to get back in it when he got a little tight serving for the match?
how do you assess your own tournament overall after coming in in such good form?
do you think you might have put a little pressure on yourself just at this stage of the tournament, because of your ranking?
what do you want to work on now to get better at?
you talked before about giving him the chance to get nervous.  what do you feel in your body when you walk to the service line to try to serve out a big match like this?  what goes wrong?
of all these guys, the new generation that everybody is talking about, who do you think is likely to break into top 10 or make a splash in a grand slam tournament?
who will you be cheering for between andy and mardy?
when you see guys like larry stefanki coaching gonzlez, gilbert coaching murray, do you wish those were guys working with some of the american players?
just the global nature of the sport?
roddick likes the hawk-eye.  federer hates it.  what do you say?
do you believe the accuracy that's claimed, particularly when you see the shadow come up, less than a millimeter?
do you think it changes strategy, considering some players are on courts that don't have hawk-eye?
davis cup is coming up in the czech republic.  when will you start preparing that?
do you feel like your game is fully formed at this point?  you've been through a lot in the last couple years and developed quite a bit.  but to come to the point usually when people's games are pretty much written in stone, and from then on it becomes execution, where are you on that scale?
five-set rollercoaster.  how would you assess the match?
talk about the fifth set.  gave a semi gift game there, but you hung tough.
you showed great patience.  even when you lost the fourth, a break back.  matter of taking those opportunities against him, given how well he was serving?
you and mardy go back a long ways, but has taken you a while to play a match at this stage of a major.
lendl tried to go from the baseline to the net.  he was not able to do it.  you seem to be making that transition pretty darn well.  am i accurate or inaccurate?
how much better were you today than when you played safin?
was that as tough of a first week as you've had at a major?
but when you've come through, quality of opponents.  dicey first round or two.
how are you physically after a couple of big matches?
are there parts of your game improving to the point where opponents might find those parts of your game unfamiliar now?
at what stage do you give yourself the luxury of saying you're in pretty good form so far this year, look down the tournament?
mardy seemed to say he thinks what separates you two is your hunger and intensity.  can you talk about what you think has separated you two.
is jimmy the sort of coach that tries to tweak stuff mid tournament?  are you working on anything in particular at the moment or does he let you go through?
lot he had to tell you after the safin match about mistakes you made or what?
not like brad?
can you be precise what he said after the safin match?
mardy said that, like brothers, you've had some arguments over the years.  what is it like on court when you play him?  temperatures get hot?
very happy to get through in three?
tough when you kind of know each other's game?
word on david?
you've been on the court for about five hours this time.  david has been on for about nine hours.  do you think that extra freshness is going to be a help for you?
is the australian open a favorite tournament for you?
how did you think you played tonight?
he seemed fairly confident beforehand.  were there any elements of you that wanted to put him in his place a little bit?
who would you consider to be the best of the so-called younger players, gasquet, djokovic, murray?  one that sticks out above all the others?
you played nadal many times.  you played murray a couple times now.  they play each other tomorrow.  what would you expect from that match?
i head a comment earlier that you never seem under any pressure in your matches and everyone is always gunning for you.  you're always expected to win.  is that the way it feels to you?
are you surprised to see tommy robredo as your opponent rather than richard gasquet?
you're a fairly even-keeled guy.  going into a match in a tournament like this, i don't know how fired up you are.  would you say you're a little more fired up playing a guy like djokovic than maybe any other match just because he's young, considered maybe a bit of a long-term threat?
you're enough of a student of the game to know that probably he is a little bit different than some of the other opponents just because the young guys are unpredictable, you never know when they can pull off a great performance?
do you think it's a bit of a hype going around djokovic and these younger guys who are coming up?
since the last time you played him, how do you assess his game, development?
you are a person who respects the pasts and traditions of tennis.  have you ever thought about reviving jumping over the net after a much match?
why do you think it disappeared in tennis?
your match looks really good.  is there anything you want to improve the rest of the tournament?
what can you say about the match?  how do you feel afterwards?  what happened?
was it a bit of an overwhelming experience?
did you at any point during the match get a feeling that you got a look into the guy, that you could get in and have a good grip on the game?
is it going to be a valuable experience for you having played roger in a grand slam tournament?
what's the difference playing against him or anybody else?
you were pretty confident before the game.  now what is your feeling?  are you as confident in your capacity after the match?
looks on paper rather like an easy match.  was it your aggression that made it that way?
does that win today give you confidence to go further into the championship?
any particular part of your game today that pleased you?
good news for lucie as well.  she got through at the same time as you.
the doubles today?
since how long are you so close with lucie?
did you go to the same school, same time, same place?
do you find the two of you doing the same thing, being from the same city, do you push each other to be better?
tough loss.  obviously served so well.  to be beaten in those circumstances must be difficult.
is he playing more patient now?
easy match for you today.  no problem?
seemed to be a specialist at comebacks.  how do you do that?
it seems you need two sets to warm up.
is there an advantage for you when your opponents know even if you're down you have it in you to go five sets?
what was tougher, to come back in the first round against tipsarevic or today?
because of love-40 or something else?
do you mean lucky because of the injury?  is that what you meant when you say you were lucky today?
was it a harder match than the scores indicated?
are you happy with your form going into the second week?  is this where you would like to be?
it was the first time you played wawrinka.  what do you think about him?
if you play murray next, how different will he be to wawrinka, the challenge?
you knew him in spain?
how much more confident are you having played like that compared to thursday night?
are you peaking at the right time?
yes.
do you feel physically 100% now?
you don't feel the injury any more?
you have won many titles as a young player, have lived with the pressure of being no.2.  you've seen in england on your visits what happens to english players under expectation.  the pressure that murray is under, is it the same as yours, or do you see it as different?
is murray one of the players that you think in years to come will be one of your great rivals?
after you won the french open this year, people were surprised you haven't won since.  coming into 2007, is there any reason why you didn't quite go on in the second half of last season?
murray has made a habit of beating spanish players.  he beat martin, then verdasco.  have you spoken to either of them since they played the matches?
what about chela?
obviously a very satisfactory performance.  best of the week so far?  best of the tournament so far?
do you think what happened against him a year ago made you step up a gear?
now it's nadal.  is that a match you wanted?
what are you most looking forward to about it?
did you say on the courtside interview you didn't think you had much of a chance?
how did you fill that time?  you said you were in bed last night at 9:30.  not knowing when you were going to play, it's not easy to get ready for the moment you're going to go on.  how did you deal with the time you had on your hands?
two of your three matches have been played with the roof shut.  i think all three of nadal's have.  does it feel different playing with the roof shut or open?
is there any reason why the serve was so much more effective tonight?
have you had a hit against nadal at any point on the road?
is it substantially a heavier ball than the other guys'?
do you recall the first time you met him?
quite an army built up.  every time seems to be more and more flags.  are you aware of this momentum that's gathering among the fans?
brad told us after the match he watched all of nadal's game today.  he wasn't prepared to tell us his view, but he did have a strategy, as you would expect, that he's going to work with you on.  how long to those strategy meetings last as a rule?
was that a case of him just making too quick a start, you giving up too much of a start to him?
he was red hot in those first two sets.
is it a case of waiting for him to go off his form, or do you have to contribute that for the turnaround to occur?  because i think it was two unforced errors he had in the first two sets.
what were your thoughts in the final game of the third set when he threw a couple of double-faults in?  must have had a bit of confidence at that stage.
how do you like his chances for the rest of the tournament?
how do you review this tournament?  you'll say you entered it to win it.  but realistically with the disrupted lead-up, how do you look back on it now?
when will you sit down with scott to discuss the further arrangement between the two of you?
how pivotal has he been for you during this tournament?
in which way has he been most important to you?  has it been helping you mentally, inspiring you, or actually helping with your game?
how are you feeling physically after this tournament?
will you take some time off now?
are you confident about what you can achieve for the rest of the year now?
the challenge you made in the last game, obviously went your way.  was it tough to get your composure back after that?
what are your thoughts about the hawk-eye system now?
just give us a bit of an update on the injury or the problems you had during the match.
was it a flare up of the continuing problems you've had with your groin?
do you think that nalbandian is mentally and physically stronger than other players?
what's up with three match points that you had --
but do you think that's part of the injury?
fabrice is a difficult opponent.  he does things a lot differently than most on the tour.  is he a difficult man to play?
to the davis cup --
we're from chile and we need to know why you don't go.
russia need all his player to win chile.  russia need nikolay davydenko.  what is your opinion?
but you no play?
last year on the shanghai masters cup you talk about how close sponsorship with the chinese brand.  now you're wearing prince again.  does that mean you down with chinese brand?
it was very tight early.  what is your assessment of the game?
is it tough to play a guy that you know so well and you're friends with?
either way, gonzlez or hewitt, two guys that have given you some problems.  talk about both of them.
where do you rank his forehand against ones you've faced?
what was it like playing with the roof closed?  seems a little chilly in there.
would you say looking back at your career to this point in slams, has there been any point - aside from the very early times when you had some cramping issues - when the fatigue factor has come into play for the second week for you?
what did you have to say to robby right at the net?
what is your memory of that lleyton match here?
yes.
wasn't pleasant?
did you say you're going to go out with robby for dinner?
what do you play?
are you playing davis cup against czech republic?
do you feel like u.s. team is heavy favorite?
have you ever been to czech republic?
6,000.
start with your thoughts on the match.
how is your hand?  do you feel any pain?
do it get caught underneath you when you went for that volley, or how did you actually do it on the court?
what about the rain and the discussion with the referee?
how close to the court were the patches that you thought were unplayable?  how close to the court were they?
right there?
at one stage it looked like you had two opponents, andy and the umpire, given those sort of circumstances.  but did you try and get over it rather quickly and refocus on the match or did it bother you for a while because i noticed at a couple of points the umpire called a ball out and then it was challenged and it was actually in, and it happened on two occasions.
it looked to me as if he was trying to prove he was right.
thankfully it moved on and the match was very good.
do you see differences or improvement in roddick since the last time you played him?
how close are you to being back at the level you were two years ago?
you were saying that the older you get the more you think of goals and that sort of thing.  do you think you thought too much?  you seemed really tentative giving the initiative away.
do you think you still have it in you to be a competitor with the best players?  it would be a terrible shame if you started to think you weren't.
how tired were you at the end of the fourth set?  how were your legs feeling?
sweet and sour?
when did you notice he was first in trouble?
did you see him staggering at all in the first service game?
how tough was it to go through the motions?
what did you say to him at the end?
is it a bit of a flat feeling or are you thinking you're in the fourth round?
in that third game, did you hit a couple of balls to him?
you didn't need to prove it today, but you're serving well in this tournament.  can you explain how you do that?
does the surface have any influence?
not the way you want to get into the fourth round, but can you talk about your potential matchups?
what was the surface like?  was it slippery at all because of the drizzly rain?
you finished up and practiced a little?
how long did you hit for after?
did you have anything to say yesterday to wayne after doubles?
looked like a comfortable straight-sets win until the third.  what happened there?
it was a very enjoyable match to watch, shot-making.  was it enjoyable to play?
your next match could be quite tricky.  your thoughts on that?
how difficult is it when you have an opponent playing almost with no fear, as he says he's going to?
there was a special point in the last set, the backhand slice contest.  your coach seemed to enjoy it.
you talked about entertaining tennis with youzhny.  if there's a guy you could go out and play, have it be entertaining tennis, who would you play to provide an entertaining match?  is there someone you can think of that matches up well in terms of entertainment?
exhibition.
how about santoro?
you mentioned nadal.  what do you think about the way he's serving?  what do you think he needs to improve on his serve?
what were the changes?
how much do you practice with stan away from davis cup over the years?
have you made up your mind on davis cup yet?
are you going to watch tonight?
do you get excited watching this kind of match on tv?  third round, pretty unusual.
does it give you a nice feeling watching two blokes, two of your strongest rivals, knocking the stuffing out of each other in the third round?
late in the third set you had zero challenge shots left.  you looked a little frustrated.  wish you might have had one or two extra there?
how tough was that four sets?
most people find it difficult at the start of a year to kind of get into a groove, into form.  you've started so well.  how do you account for how well you've started this year?
where did you do all the physical work?
most people would probably describe playing federer like climbing a mountain.  how are you looking forward to that challenge, if it does become that?
what is the key to serve well here in australian open?
yes.
you've made some changes in your serve.  do you have an opinion on nadal's serve?
you say you worked a lot on the volley.  did you feel that was a part of your game that needed a lot of improvement?
a lot of players when they step on the court against roger don't believe they can win.  a few moments ago you sounded convinced you can win.  why is that?
what is your strategy going in?  what do you think you have to do well?
nadal probably has had the most success against federer.  he's left-handed, a different kind of athlete.  is there anything you can take from his success that you might be able to use in your match?
jim courier said on tv generally against federer, the thing is to hit every ball to the backhand.  he said when he played pete sampras, he wouldn't give him the satisfaction of running for the forehand.  strange strategy, but he's very stubborn.
what did you do on your vacation?  you said you love to ski.  do you still ski now?
where are you living?
a year ago there were these people flirting with you, like you were a pretty girl at a dance, well, from a certain country.  i guess that's not happening that much any more.
a certain country was flirting with you.  they were maybe trying to have you come to their country.
do you miss that?
you went down swinging.  you had a good crack at it.  where did you feel like you fell short?
what do you take away from it?
in terms of power and such, it seemed like you matched him.  is it just that they play those big points really well?
are you closer to these guys than you thought you were when you started or further away now that you've had a taste of this level?
how much did he lift his intensity compared to when you played him in sydney?
you got enormous crowd support out there.  how does that feel?
where do you go from here, back to challengers and qualifying and all those things?
could you tell us where you got hit with those two balls, how badly it hurt.  when kohlschreiber hit you at the net with those two balls, where did it hit and badly did it hurt?
where did the second one hit you?
on the racquet?
it was a good fight.  did you like it?
were you surprised by the way he played?
does it give you confidence that you don't play your best and you still win?
do you feel like you need to improve in your service games?
do you expect a more difficult task in the next round?
what do you know about him?  never played him?
fans were very loud.  did the spanish fans help you or did the german fans bother you at all?
from playing michael russell, being two sets and a breakdown in the first-round match, you seem to be getting back in the groove.  are you pretty happy?  how do you think you've done it?
is there a problem at the moment with serving?  just a lack of match play?
when you've been away, your serve is usually the last thing that clicks in for you?
you said you wanted match practice.  a little bit more than you'd like at this point?
you mentioned at indian wells that you wanted to improve your approach shot and volley.  your volley looked crisp.  have you improved a lot on the approach and volley?
you seemed more willing today to go to the net though.  is that a conscious thing?
no shortage of advice leading into the tournament.  part of it came from todd woodbridge monday when he suggested you have too many off-court distractions now to really produce your best tennis.  he felt you were zapped of energy when you walked out on court.  do you have any response?
in what way?
so is it just a point of it's unusual to have a former davis cup teammate being critical, publicly?
how big a factor was the heat today?  what is your view on the heat policy, how uncomfortable?
you don't think the matches should be stopped once they're started?
you always have got nadal in trouble.  can you explain what you do against him?  what is your recipe?
what is your plan?
gonzlez, if he wins, what do you expect from him?
how much better will you have to play?
have you seen del potro?
how is your calf and your physical condition general?
are you growing in confidence that you can make a very big impact in the second week?
have you heard much about del potro?  he seems to be a player on the rise.
got someone out there watching him now?
shortly after he got out of the hands of the trainers, you and he traded shots with 22 rallies, which ended with him diving.  do you get cynical when you see that sort of thing?
yes.
how did you play today?  how do you feel about your upcoming match?
two brothers in two successive matches.  odd situation.
have you played them before like that?
didn't think you were seeing double?
quite a big battle for you tonight.
how are you feeling physically now after that?
what are you expecting from lleyton hewitt in your next match?
what do you make of his form at the moment?  he's dropped in the rankings a little bit.
do you think he might be more vulnerable, danger of being beaten, by not playing so much?
how would you sum up your game today?
yesterday serena williams was at 4-love the second set, lost the next two games, which seemed strange, and she said she was daydreaming.  did you start the day daydreaming perhaps?
what's it like facing somebody who you're so familiar with?
a lot of guys come on tour and have a really quick impact and jump up the rankings really quickly, and you've probably done more of an apprenticeship.  was there a time when you thought, is my time going to come, am i going to be able to make the next jump?
do you feel used to winning now?
you're one of the few players with a good record against nadal.  would you explain your recipe?  what does your game have?
can you talk about the potential match-up against robby?
he gave you some tips against almagro.  are you going to give him some tips on how to play you?
(question regarding a bet in sydney.)
what do you think about the first chapter of your career?  was up and down, and now you're sort of level at this point, and been able to sustain it for a long period of time.  does that surprise you that you've been able to sustain that level and what's the secret to that?
there's been some differing views on hawk-eye.  you didn't seem to muck around at all with the chair; you just pointed to the screen when you wanted to challenge.  what are your thoughts on it?
you'd prefer to play on a hawk-eye court then?
your forehand is probably one of the fastest on tour.  what do you think of monfils'?
your backhand improvement, has that made the difference do you think overall?
you've always been i guess considered a bit of a spokesman and had your role with the players' council and that sort of stuff.  does that responsibility or role fit a little bit more comfortably now that you're sort of a top five player?
what's your thought on moving davis cup to the week after wimbledon and the us open?
alex talked about you being a role model for him and other players.  at your ancient age, how does that feel?
the first four sets were a bit of a struggle.  the rain came and then you dominated.  what was the story of the match?
what did you say to yourself in the break when the rain was coming?
how aware were you that the rain was coming?  could you feel that the rain was coming?
you used it to your advantage?
you've beaten andy roddick in the semifinal in moscow in september.  do you think that might have an influence on your third-round match over here?
you had another experience with rain at this tournament and it worked out well for you, as well, again.  tommy haas?
what's the dynamic with you and andy?  how does the match decide itself?  how does it play out?
these two particular five-setters, how do you feel physically?
can you compare the coaches, volkov against jimmy connors?
so he wants you to move ahead all the time then, alex?
had you seen sela before, and were familiar with his game?  how familiar were you with his ability?
will you be getting a chance to watch your sister play at all this week?
how well do you think she'll go this year?
how many five-setters do you think you have in your body at this tournament?
seven?
i don't think you've ever lost a five-setter here.
how do you compare today's match with your first-round match?
sort of a joke, but how much are you rooting for dudi?
obviously, would it be preferable to play dudi?
in a sense, it's his fault.  you're sort of top eight.  he's the one that's dropped off to allow this possibility to occur.
are you speaking to jimmy every day?
did that work out well?  indianapolis is where you first did that.
what are the dynamics of the difference when he's actually at a tournament and when you're dealing with him on the phone?
were you really looking forward to having him here?
if you had to isolate one thing, the most important thing that jimmy has done for you or with you, what would you say that would be?
has it had any impact on your attitude on the court, your combativeness, the way you approach things, or is that pretty innate?
do you have clear memories of what he was like when he was at his best, pumped up?
what do you think when you see him at his belligerent best?  do you like what you see when you see that stuff?
do you think it's more effective to play tennis with joy or with anger, sort of channeling yourself on the court?
what is more effective, do you think, maybe in your own case?
you can serve and volley as well as play from the baseline.  what do you think of the role of serve and volley in modern tennis?
roger federer said before that with the hawk-eye, some of the umpires were maybe a little more hesitant to make overrules.  they're leaving it to the players to challenge.  have you found that yet?
pretty big group of americans that have scrapped their way into the second round, some older, some younger, some coming back.  what are your thoughts on some of the guys still alive here?
just a few.  mardy.
mardy, sam.
how well do you know kuznetsov?
a match with marat, between you and marat, for some reason to me doesn't come immediately to mind, but which ones would and how will you sort of think about them --
as a guy with a two-hander, what do you make of his two-hander?
is he a less intimidating match-up than two or three years ago?
yes.
there's already been quite a significant number of heroics out here, the first three days, not least yesterday when players were playing in terrible heat, some called at 11:30 at night. how tough is it to actually win this event, in terms of winning this event so early in the year, given all the conditions, extremes, to actually go out and give it your best so soon in the year with the temperatures we get sometimes down here?
how did your training differ for this?
can you remember what time your match started against el aynaoui, what time it was when you were called?
how would you rate etienne de villiers' first year at the atp?
what should he be looking to do?
can you talk to us about the injury, what exactly happened and how it feels?
so it eased up?  once you removed it, it was better?
how about the crowd out there and winning on a stage like this and a match like this?  is this the biggest one of your career?  describe how it feels out there.
last year marcos baghdatis obviously went on -- no one knew much about him at the start of the year.  he went on to reach the final.  do you hope you can do maybe something similar now that you've had this breakthrough?
marcos beat you in august last year.  how much do you think you've improved since the last time you've played him, and what did you learn from that match?
do you feel like you can continue to play with all the sliding and the movement, or do you ever fear for your health?  are you going to be able to sustain that as you get older?
do you feel more comfortable on this surface now?
now you play someone who you know very well, richard gasquet, in the next round.  you've played each other many times?
just quickly, how does it feel to get through to your first third round of the australian open?
was that straight-sets win as easy as the score line indicated?
did your level improve from the first match?
is it a bit more challenging for you to play one of the oldest guys on the circuit who has a few more tricks up his sleeve than the younger guys maybe?
as always, obviously one game at a time, but when you hear about someone like djokovic playing so well, losing only 10 games in two matches, you know he's in your little section, does that interest you at all?  do you pay attention to that?
there was a bit of banter at the end with the tv guys.  when you watch back tapes of yourself, do you take notice of what the commentators say?
are you aware of how the adulation is in their commentary?
almost drooling over how good you are.
never embarrassing?
do you read as much press as you used to about yourself?
considering the heat yesterday, the heat policy, it came into question, the fairness of that, the well-being of the players.  do you think that's something that needs to be reviewed and looked at?
but is it fair if they've started, they have to continue on in that kind of heat, where other people don't have to?
the question of hawk-eye, i know you're not the biggest fan, jonas raised a question on court, andy has spoken of it, as well, officials deciding not to make a decision when they normally would make a decision because they feel they should wait for the player to make the call or rely on technology.  is there a danger of the officials standing back when they actually should be taking the lead?
how would you assess etienne de villiers' first year in running the atp?  how badly did it need someone like him to come in and shake it up?
are you in favor of the move for a new big event in madrid, breaking the traditional clay court circuits, the combined event in madrid?
second set, you were looking good.  5-2.  what happened then?
how is your arm?
your next opponent, what do you know about him?
how much more improvement is there in your game?  a lot?  a little bit?
were the supporters a factor today in the match?
lopez said that among the young players like gasquet or berdych or murray, he considers you the best.  do you think you're in the best moment of your career right now?
you don't feel any pressure?
you're impressing him in that regard, you seem to be very sharp-minded.
what exactly is the diagnosis on your shoulder and your biceps?
did you have it in adelaide?
has it happened before?
it was in umag, right?
it probably isn't the way you wanted to go out, i'm sure, out of this tournament, but do you feel like he deserved it, or did you have trouble keeping the ball on the court?
you were playing well in the third set and then he had his problem with his foot and the match changed totally after that.
he seemed to be unable to walk, and then suddenly he was running around like a deer.
how different would you say your attitude and the way you approached your matches coming here this year was compared to last year?
the pressure you spoke about the other day with a large family here, did you think you carried that onto the court tonight?
are there lessons that you'll take into other major tournaments after this with some of the off-court stuff you talked about with a lot of people around and do things differently at other tournaments?
have you felt like that before at a big match?
it's hard right away after a match, too.
one thing i had asked is you were sort of a marked man after you got to the final here last year.  people were eager to play you and you said you were the player to beat.  that was the case last year, too, so why can you feel so differently this time?
people were looking at playing you more after australia last year all season, right?
because of the points?
can we just go back to monfils for a second?  you played him in august last year.  how much has he improved since then?
five sets in the first round, four sets in the second.
looked easier than the first round.  did it feel easier?
how does it feel to be in the third round again?  how does it feel to be in what you said is your last australian open?
do you think because the horizon is getting closer, it's giving you added impetus to keep going?
does that mean you're going for different shots?  feel lighter in the shoulders?
you said on tv you were watching sesame street with your daughter.  do you feel the pressure is off?
who is your favorite sesame street characters?
how is your stomach and your general health now?
what about your own creaky bones, best-of-five sets taking its toll?
how much can you draw from the crowd support?
the crowd support, what do you think your fans see in you as a person as opposed to a player?
your celebration, the way you collapse at the end, your trademark.
do you still feel like you're playing some of your best tennis?
do you care where you play your next match?
have you played rod laver in your nine singles appearances here?
if they want to put you on rod laver, you'll say, no thanks, give me margaret?
you came to the net 89 times in that match.
how big a part of your game is serve and volley?  is it a shame it's kind of phasing out?
there's a 7% improvement in your first serve from this game to your last.  what do you attribute that to?
mardy fish said that you're good mates.
will that help or hinder you?
what do you have to do well against a guy like that?
will you throw something different at him --
-- like maybe blue hair or something like that?
you seem to be enjoying this so much.  how does this compare to other grand slams you've been in?  seems to be one of your favorites?
have you made a schedule beyond here?
was it hard not to break out in laughter with the guy with multi-colored hair?
slightly different feeling from this time last year.
in terms of the conditions on that court, do you think the way it worked with the weather it worked in your favor in the end?
15-love in that sixth game of the third set, when you smacked your racquet, was that an annoyance that you probably wanted to win love-love-love?
looked pretty impressive.  where do you think your game is?  can you judge from that yourself?
a little fellow in the crowd was giving you support.  how aware were you?  how much help was it?
could you tell us a little bit about the training you've been doing in the winter period, what difference it has made to your attitude and game.
you clearly feel comfortable.  how does it feel coming back here second year running?  does it just feel that much better?
did you see any of alan mackin's match?  you must have some sympathy for him having to play in that heat, especially against a south american.
any sympathy for a guy who is on the other end of 6-love, 6-love, 6-love?
what can you say to him at the net when you shake hands afterwards?
when you've spent most of the day preparing to play outdoors, even though it was going to be at 7:30, it still likely to be pretty hot.  is there a little extra tension when you suddenly find yourself playing indoors, cooler, conditions aren't what you possibly have been preparing for?
of all the courts you played in the world now, which would you say was your favorite court?
was vodafone here, after what happened last year, was that one of your least favorites?
federer said before the tournament started that you and djokovic could be two guys who could emerge as potential winners of a grand slam this season.  do you think you have the game all set for that, be one of the contenders?
seeing our sports reputation has taken a bit of a kicking down here as of late, do you follow cricket at all?
going down a break in the third, your thoughts then?
how do you think you've pulled up?
can that competitive match help get your juices flowing like that?
looking ahead now, are you concerned you've spent that extra amount of time on court tonight, or is it not a worry because you didn't have all that match practice you really would have liked last week?
any symbolism in kissing the court at the end of the match?  some might consider it unusual because it's the first round.  are you all of a sudden in love with the rebound ace?
does that worry you, that you had to dig so hard so early on in the tournament?
you've told us a couple days ago how you believe you're mentally fit.  after tonight, does this help that cause in terms of being able to come back from two sets down?
dancevic next round, lleyton.
any twinge with your calf?
is twice enough?
how weird is that to play somebody again so soon?
do you have a goal set for yourself this tournament?
your best is a lot better than it was two years ago?
last year you won sydney, played well, lost to robredo.  how to a void that this year, not having a letdown in a match when you come up against good players the rest of the tournament?
do you think you've improved your game because you played in shanghai?
what suits your game or doesn't suit your game about rebound ace versus the decoturf at the us open?
you had to be pretty happy when you saw the draw that federer wasn't on your side?
talking about kuznetsov, these young guys, americans have been making some noise here in the first round.  what do you make of that?
what is your take on sam?
he had a hole in the sole of his shoe?
what is your take with the council, the roof policy?  are the players happy?  roof is open, everybody else is stopped on the outside courts?
you were serving for a two-set lead.  what went wrong there?
what was it like out there, the big court, your first australian open?
no nerves?
early on, was that the best that you've ever played?  it was a very tough first set.
was that one of the best sets that you've ever played?
he questioned a lot of calls.  did that bother you at all?
did you think at all that he was trying to bother you by questioning so many calls?
do you like these late-night matches?
not really fun?
you have a knack of giving the fans good value for money at that time of night.
given you're still on the comeback from injuries last year, do you think it's good to get a five-setter under your belt early in the tournament?
were there stages tonight where you thought you were going to lose it?
you've come here before off long-term injuries, time-outs, had to play some long matches, then made it to the final.  do you draw confidence from that for this campaign?
pretty good record in five sets.  when you lose in the fifth set, it's close.  do you go to a fifth set with a special frame of mind?
you said your movement was not that good.  was that the explanation, why you were a little bit off with your forehands?
do you feel like you're the defending champion?
what did you think about your first game?
when you got your hands over your head, what's going through your mind there?
what does todd say about closing out matches?
what does it say to you about yourself to beat a top player at a slam, given everything you've gone through?
how did you react when you saw your draw, ljubicic?
what have you learned about yourself through this process of rebuilding your game?
what do you mean?  you don't think you got the credit you deserved?
it's not that easy to change a stroke completely when you've been playing one way for a long time.  why did you decide to do it and how quickly did it come?
it's a grip change?
it's more low to high now?
the opening game break, you finished that off with a forehand?
yes.
it's been a while since we could say six american men on one side of a draw during a slam.
did andy say, thanks for knocking ljubicic out of my quarter?
how much has he been helping you emotionally through this period of time?
do you think that was a big mental win for him over federer the other day, or do you throw it out because it's an xo?
how would you sum up your first round match?  it looked pretty easy, straight sets, but i guess it wasn't all that easy.
what's the proper way to address you now?  is it mr. ambassador?  is it your honor?
was he doing anything today that you were finding difficult or more so than any other opponent?
what was the problem with the foot?
is there anything you have to work on for the next match?  is there some aspect of your game you've got to think about?
i guess it's hard to believe that there was a time when you weren't winning everything.
you're playing now at such a high level.  how much room for improvement is there?  i mean, how can you improve?
isn't it just a little bit of an adrenaline rush on the first day of a grand slam?  do you wake up in the morning on day one and think, all right, it's business again, and this is really exciting?
when you were a boy growing up in europe, were you curious about that island at the bottom of the world?  were you anxious to see it?  did you have any notions about kangaroos or anything like that?
now you own it.
given the change in your preparation this year, are you happy with where your game is at now?  you've had a look at your first grand slam match.  are you satisfied?
marcos, a tougher match than the scores indicated.  are you happy with the way it all turned out?
what do you mean by thinking too much?  thinking about your opponent or thinking about other things?
why would you do that?
the fact that he was a finalist here in 2003, did that play on your mind a bit?
you had no problems from the injury you picked up in sydney?
how did you feel the crowd were today?  were they up to your usual standards and pushing you on and encouraging you all the way?
do you feel that there's pressure on you to try and live up to what you achieved last year?
were you able to block out the expectations, or is it a problem?
have you looked ahead to your next match?
have you seen who it is?
yeah.  any thoughts on that?
when you were with the crowd, did you have a feeling it was a new tournament, or did you feel it was a continuation of the last one in 2006?
and which are your goals now?
if the pressure becomes a little too great -- and you talked about the pressure before -- would you change something in your routine these next two weeks?  take more time out for yourself?  take more privacy?
have you made your mind up what you're going to do to correct it?
you look troubled, though.
where is the smile?
was today tougher than you thought it might be out there?
more than you did when you walked out of the locker room today?
you were hitting it pretty well in sydney last week, weren't you?
you say that the pressure is coming from inside your team.  why is that?
does your father think he knows a lot about tennis?
is that a problem sometimes?
you're not afraid if you don't play well he'll send you to bed without supper?
you're not feeling that if you don't play well he'll send you to bed without supper?
does it feel strange playing in front of him?
we see a wonderful photo from sydney.  you and mauresmo playing cards in the tournament, and you are the two finalists of last year here.  was there something funny about this final?  can you say what you are laughing about?
we received a photo from sydney, and you were laughing with mauresmo.
just as if something was funny about the final or about --
what happened against carlos in sydney?  it looked like you had that match.  how do you see it in your own mind?  what happened?
could you give us a summary of your thoughts on today's match in your native tongue?
for someone that wasn't feeling too good last night, that was a remarkable comeback.
do you mind being called wayne-0?
have you formally announced this is your last year?
or your last australian open?
did you think it was the last?
was that in your mind sort of during the match, i don't want to go out this way?
was there a point you feel it turned?
did you practice before the match at all?
when did you last have a meal?
you've had better wins with higher-ranked opponents, but in terms of courageous wins, is this as good as you've had?
and a day of just some treatment or sort of recovery tomorrow?
what do you know about your next opponent?
you're living here now, aren't you?
you said it would definitely be your last australian open.  does that mean you'll retire at some point in the year, you just don't know when?
does had a mean doubles, too?
certainly a chance to play kooyong.
and davis cup, when we spoke last you said you hadn't decided whether you'd be decided for the first round tie.
could i just ask how you felt about your first game?
there was some trouble with some croatian fans outside.  is there anything you'd like to say in terms of respecting players and other fans?
while you were actually on court.
you didn't notice them getting up to leave during your match?
any thoughts about repeating great success with a croatian team with a davis cup as you had in bratislava two years ago?
what do you take out of today's game that you're focused for round two?
you don't be afraid to be pleasant of the victory on the clay?  be honest, to be disagreeable.  ( in italian)
it's a job, of course.
complimente.  first set, set point you play serve and volley.  have you ever done that before in a set point?
how much has yesterday's match taken out of you physically?  when you practiced this morning, how did you feel?
not very good?
did you expect a tougher match in gonzlez?
do you think davydenko is the most dangerous opponent for you in the clay season, even thinking about paris, or not, or still federer?
what do you think about federer and tony roach?  federer fire tony roach?
he's not working anymore with roach.
all the masters series now are played best-of-three.  do you think that best-of-five sets will be even better for you?
in each tournament you beat a new record.  in this tournament two records.  mcenroe and then three times winner in rome nobody has done.  which is the next record you're thinking about, if there is any record you think about?
yeah.  chris evert is able to win five times in rome.  you have to look in the women now.
you say, i am tired.  so do you go to hamburg?
do you know the draw in hamburg?
yesterday you were very happy after winning davydenko, maybe like a final, because you know that the way of playing of gonzlez was easier for you?
which recharge battery do you use to be fit one day after a three-hour match?
before i heard something about story about bottle, about how you arrange the bottle on the court.  are you perhaps a little bit superstitious?
you won three finals here.  which one in which order you will remember them?  what difference any mean?  okay, five hours coria, federer, this one.  in which ranking will you remember these three finals?
how much of a physical test was that for you today?
does breaking mcenroe's record mean anything, or is your mind completely on the final tomorrow?
you normally react the way you reacted today when you've won the title.  did it almost feel, beating davydenko, as though it was winning a title?
your reaction afterwards is usually the reaction that you do if you win a final.
so it was almost as important to you --
you finished with some great shots, and suddenly you seemed to have new strength.  where did you get that from?  you suddenly at the end, your strength at the end came back.
you:  up, down, up, down.  davydenko:  up, down, up, down in the match.  can you explain why?
after such a long run, so many wins, do you feel tired?  do you feel fatigued?  or do you feel okay?
so many wins.
yeah.
how have you been feeling with your dizziness and your stomach?
yesterday during the double you had a problem with the knee or the left leg.  do you still have problems?
did you prefer to avoid an italian player?  how do you imagine a final with volandri tomorrow?
did you prefer to avoid him because he's italian, or not?
was that match today your toughest match on clay since the final against federer here last year?
will there be an element of revenge with gonzlez because of australia?
what's important for you to do against gonzlez, to be successful against him?
(from italian) the first two sets you play a little bit shorter than usual and your serve was a little bit less effective than usual.  was it due to davydenko or was it you?
(from italian) another time i saw you running faster than the ball.  do you like when people think that you are not human, that you are like not --
(from italian) there is a movie of it.  it seems like you run faster than the ball once.
is there anything you could have done better today?
what do you think about the difference at the end?
you must feel a lot more confident about beating him next time you play.
compared to last year, 2006 when you lost to roger in the australian open, it was a very, very good match.  how are your feelings now losing to a very good player, same as rafa and roger last year?
you feel he was not tired?  do you feel that he was not tired?
did you notice that the public, the italian people here, have a special feeling with you, especially after the second set?
set point in the first set, the dropshot, was that just --
can you imagine nadal not losing a single match on clay this year?
how would you have felt if you had to play tomorrow against gonzlez?  and how do you think rafa will feel after such a tough match?
is there just as much pleasure almost in following up the next day winning the match than there is beating federer the previous day?
the last three matches against berdych you have a lot of success.  what did you do better?  what did you change?  what was the reason for the success?
can you just give us an impression of what it's like it play out there with that crowd, every one wants you to win?
you're not known to have the best serve, but you had to problems against federer and no problems against berdych on your serve at all.  what's the secret?
what would it mean for you to play in the final of this italian championship?
just how good is rafa at the moment?  he seems maybe better than ever.
have you learned much from today's match about how you would play him next time on clay?
you tried to play a lot of dropshots.  did you feel that this was the right tactic against him?
were you worried at all today having won estoril and the tough matches here the physical part of it?  you seemed to hold up physically.  were you worried you might not be able to?
what do you think you should improve in your playing for to be closer to him, to roger or nadal?
you play well on all surfaces.  where do you rate clay?
we could watch you and see that you see an opening, and that opening against most players you'll hit a winner into.  what goes through your mind when you see the opening with him and it seems like so often he can get them?
on clay this year do you think he's got further away from everyone compared to last year?
you saved a lot of breakpoints in the third set.  do you think you're becoming more famous now?
how important was the fact that you beat marat in that first match?  i mean, that was probably the match you didn't want to play here in the first match.
today there was less pressure than yesterday?  you feel very comfortable with the crowd?
in your opinion, volandri can beat berdych?
what do you think about nadal?
you're not as famous as marat or roger, but you're a fantastic player.  in traveling the world, has there been one time when you were surprised when somebody recognized you, who knew who you were, that you were nikolay davydenko?
you like that, or would you rather be more private?
if you were in a clay court tournament and nadal is on the next practice court, would you watch him practice, or would you think, i'd rather not actually watch him play at all, i'd rather walk by and not look at him?
how many days did you practice with him in mallorca?
can you help us to understand this performance about volandri?  because he beat gasquet, federer, berdych, all players better than him in the ranking.
yes.
this is a good reason, but do you play less better than your ranking or it was just he was better than you, or it was a bad day?
you took only five points on his serve.  did he improve the service, or you had problem to return?
were you surprised at the way he was returning your serve?
and what about you?  nothing was working or it was just him was playing so wonderfully?  because you never reached 30 on his serve.  you only made 5 points only 5 times to 15.  so how do you explain that?  that is quite a surprise, or not?
how did you find the crowd?
the crowd, the environment.
it was nice?
how disappointed are you with your serve?  you don't regret anything or you think, i should have done maybe or not?
is volandri, in your opinion, can win this tournament?  can beat a player like nadal?
before this match, before you play with volandri, did you ever thought that his level was maybe better than his ranking, or maybe you already thought that he was number 50 in the world?  do you think that he was playing better than his ranking was saying or not before this match?  he is 53 in the rankings.  do you think he's better or not?
you're playing the match.  you're winning.  but are you believing it?
what does did do when you here fil-li-ppo, po-, po?  does it jack you up?
was that a useless experience, or did you actually take anything out of the match?
where do you take it from here given that hamburg is not going to be any better conditions?
i hope this hasn't been asked.  you started to come in at the end.  was it too late?
davis cup question.  sweden chose indoor for the finals.
yeah.
what do you think about that?  does it suit your game?
were you surprised that they didn't choose clay?
you handled him pretty well on hard courts.  do you sense a difference in him when a guy returns to his home footing?
(in italian) so would you say that your defeat was mostly due to the fact that it was not your favorite surface or you were not at your best shape?
you mentioned fun yesterday.  i suppose two argentinians in successive days on clay takes of the fun out of it.
(in italian) what do you think about what happened to players like correia and nalbandian who played better few years ago and are playing a little bit less at the top, in your opinion?
roger what happened today?  the crowd, the people, i don't know?  what happened?
i missed the beginning of the answer, but is something wrong today physically?
did volandri surprise you?
were you feeling well?  were you okay?  was there a problem?
no fever?
was it the heat?
do you think you played just one match four days in a row rome it was so bad for you?  not so much training to have --
do you think that after this match can change something about your preparation for roland garros?
we understand it's difficult for you to accept this defeat in this moment, but for us it's more difficult for us to understand what happened to you.  what was the problem, if there was a problem?  if it was difficult for you to play for some reason, if you can help us to find out.
did you feel different feeling after the first match?  you feel in a different way this morning, or not?
what was more surprising maybe was that you lost your first three serves always two points for each game.  how do you explain that?
when was the last time you didn't feel your shots like that?  was that shocking?
what was the strangest thing that happened there?  he hit that drop volley at matchpoint.  there were a lot of goofy things going on.
have you been practicing the forehand drop?
how much stock are you putting in this win?  this guy is a former french open winner, and at the same time he's down to 71 in the rankings and considering retirement?
you had matchpoints.  did you think back to that screwy match with verdasco a couple years ago.  you had matchpoints and it got away from you.
a tennis year can turn on one match, good or bad.  your reaction at the end there i think spoke volumes of how much it means to you to win a match like that.
any changes in your clay court game coming in more, about the same?
did you like the challenge?  americans have not done well here.  or do you say well, it's masters event and i've got it play them?
when in rome andy.
have you ever had a guy save a mathchpoint on you with a drop volley from behind the service line?
i think he thought it might have been a double fought and it hit the back of the line.
would have been a real bummer to be in a third set after that.
(in italian) two questions.  the first one is that we have seen you playing some good shots at the net, so is it connor's influence, and is he here with you in rome?
bearing in mind what you said about today, do you actually prefer, say, a grand slam best-of-five, or do you like that you're getting your quick chances?
do you like playing on this court?  there's a good atmosphere, a bit of a fan club as well.  is this a court where you think you really do enjoy it?
are you going to see the football match tonight?
how do you feel the match went today?  are you happy with your form?
any special reason why you felt dizzy?
what do you think about the next round against youzhny?
why is youzhny difficult for you?
why do you choose to play doubles in tournaments like here?  do you think it helps you a lot for the singles?
i know this is clay, but which of the three other grand slams do you think you have the best chance to win?  the three other grand slams, aside from paris, which do you think you have the best chance to win?
speak about the match today.
your feeling here is better than in monte-carlo with the red clay?
first time in rome in men's draw.  first time you play.  qualification last you lose.
and today all people are for you.
do you feel that after miami that is the biggest one for the moment, your biggest?
yeah.  something is change around you from the people, from the public?
more pressure?
what do you think about the next round against baghdatis?
you play after the winner one tournament?
you won estoril?
so you must play after and is it more difficult than less difficult?
(from italian) can you talk about the match?  just start with it was a little bit difficult and it got better.
(from italian) what about the second turn against davydenko, what do you expect?
we all know that when you play your best game you can beat anybody in the world.  how have you been feeling lately?  do you feel you're coming into form?
when did you last have that?
considering how tight the match was here last year, were you pleased with how it went today?
have you changed anything in your clay court preparations from last year?
i think that italian tennis needs help.  perhaps your help.  which advice can you give to bracciali to beat nadal?
do you think it's better to give to him corner or perhaps it's better to send the ball to the volley?
you made reference here to the shorter monte-carlo final, and obviously shorter finals all around now.  do you think in a way that could help in the sense that it gives you a better chance of playing hamburg and getting more matches in?
i'm sorry if you already answered this.  is the french open your absolute no.1 priority this year?
were these basically ideal conditions for you on clay today?
do you think it's a bit odd now it's only the grand slams and davis cup where you got best-of-five-set matches, and virtually the rest of the year playing three sets?  is that strange in the sport to be playing at a certain level and the rest of the year only three-set matches?
americans seem to have an aversion to clay, but you seem to quite like it.
(in italian) is it something special for you to play in rome where you had that accident?
(in italian)  do you think you can win this tournament?
(in italian) in italy we are talking a lot about the cyclist, basso, who has admitted to using steroids.  so there is sort of a lot of people talking about this.  do you think it's a problem in tennis as well, or just a problem with other sports?
talk about your form.  last year you lost to monfils in five sets, whereas now you've just beaten him in straight sets.  so you see that as an improvement for you?
can you give us your look at it, andy?
in what way do you not feel great in the longer rallies?
do you feel if the break hadn't come when it did after the second set you might have been able to push on then?  you were well on top.
was he a particular tricky player to play against?  not in a way dissimilar to your own game, is it?
tim thought that conditions were very heavy when he was playing sort of in the of sun today.  did you find it totally different than the one set you managed to get in in monte-carlo?  can you make any comparisons at all?
what will you do now?
do you feel 100% over the physical stuff?
do you feel like you're playing catch up with the clay court season now, the french?
you must at least be encouraged that the back seems okay.  i know you struggled in the longer rallies, but you said back was okay today?
just what happened out there?  was it a matter of a rain delay, or are you feeling all right?
is it a bit frustrating to be always in the same sort of condition here in rome, because this is not the first time this happened to you here?
may i ask you, maybe it's an embarrassing question, but you have been no.1 in the world 80 weeks, not just two or three.  you play singles, and at the same time there is a double where nadal and federer are playing and 4,000 people watch the doubles.  what that means to you?  it's the media who have built up the image of those two top players right now and they don't give consideration enough to the other players?  what's your reaction?
so it's not frustrating?  you don't feel lonesome?
one more question about kim clijsters.  yesterday she decided to retire and she announce it officially.  what was your opinion about that?  it was a mistake to try to play this year when she had already planned to get married in july?  she should have done something different, or what do you think?
for you now, where do you go now?  put a little wrench in your plans?  french open preparation?
right.
and for you, being nadal and federer are where they are, what is your goal?  i mean, what is the goal of everybody more or less who was top, no.1 in the world?  to become no.3?  or you still see the possibility or you dream about going back and being where you were?
the family life has mellowed you a bit in your opinion?  you were more relaxed or instead you're more nervous, you know, to be married and have a child sometimes changed people?
what about henman on the clay?
you annoyed with the last two points of that first set?
how are you feeling?  how's the back?
you've played here obviously when it's been dull, wet and cold.
why was it -- is it slower this year?
he did well last year.
given the notoriousness of hamburg's conditions, and you talked about cold and miserable conditions, it's likely to be that there.
do you have any thoughts of sidestepping that?
you're not?
so at the moment are you thinking --
you mentioned about it being, i think you said, harder to make an impact.
to what extent do you think it's getting harder and harder and harder to make an impact?
compared to the last time you slipped to this level couple years ago, do you feel as confident now about to reclaiming the position as you were then?
playing nottingham could be the missing link to your wimbledon.
on just slightly different tack, tim, you're obviously part of the brain trust that decided we wanted to play on grass against of croatians.  what was the gist of thinking behind that decision?
have you set yourself goals at all this year?
what do you think of roehampton?  have you practiced there?
what you do you think of the facility?
what happened to your forehand today?
beside the forehand, what should you do to beat him on clay?
you played 19 sets against him and you won only 5.  what that means?  i mean, almost one out of three.  that's big, big difference apparently.  the reason, explanation is only technical or sometimes mental?  do you get nervous when things are not going well?
clay, clay.
yeah.
is this where tony comes in handy, where you can both analyze what you think is more information and use it on this surface, which you say is obviously the one you want to improve on?
what i meant before is that it is not mental, because even the serve, which has nothing to do -- or not much to do with nadal -- it is not working as it usually does.  i mean, you are bad percentage and second serve you lost a lot of points.  is it something that makes you more nervous or anxious when have to play him or not?
on the evidence of today and what you've seen generally this week of rafa, do you think his game has gone on from last year, that he's better?
is there any new information you think you can carry forward today from what you found in the game?
what are i looking at, the paper?
what do you think of the match?
i against federer it will the first match of the year, 2007.  what do you think is the biggest change compared to last year, apart from the fact that this time you will play best-of-three?
so you don't see any change in his game at all?
you're saying that you are playing better this year than last year the same time.  do you think he's also playing better this year than last time?
federer.
for you, rafa, what's the importance of your recent win in indian wells in terms of your confidence?
why did you decide to have a little training right now after the match?
was it spontaneous?
do you consider yourself as the favorite tomorrow?  you have one like 66 matches in a row.
you have a same opinion of federer about atp problems and the calendar of 2009.  do you think that federer has the same opinion of yours about which is the no.1 on clay?
you are spanish, but we have never asked you -- i have never asked you -- about madrid as a masters series.  what do you think about that?  because that's the tournament that makes all the problems because madrid comes in the spring, hamburg, barcelona, monte-carlo.  what do you think?
roger said that he would maybe like for the fans tomorrow to play best of five.  what about you?  for the fans in the stadium would you prefer to play best-of-five?
for the fans he thinks it would be best to play best-of-five.
you're playing better and better.  but you were a little bit in trouble in the first set when you were down 3-1 and he had three breakpoints to go 4-1.  why?
seven.
how satisfied are you the way your game has come on this week up until now?
if you go to the final tomorrow with nadal, what do you feel?  are you sure you're going to play again?
if you play against nadal tomorrow for the final, what do you think about it?  do you think -- are you sure he's going to play against you this final again, or you think it's more you --
were you unsettled by some noise early on?
does it affect your concentration?
you were a little bit frustrated by the end of the game?  you seemed like you have maybe frustrated by it.
did you think you could have broken him?  in the second set there was one game where you went for the forehand when it was breakpoint and seemed a bit annoyed that you missed that chance.
what is the difference between nadal on clay and hard courts for you?
yeah.  but i'm more interested in your point of view.
why so difficult to break him more than everything, to get a breakpoint?
how did you see federer comparing going into tomorrow's game?
do you think his game is now pretty much complete on clay, or is there still something he needs to maybe improve?
just on clay is there anything?
can you talk about this match?
aren't you afraid that you were not challenged enough winning in straight sense until now?  is it going to be a problem for the next matches?
you lost three times against berdych, but this time it's going to be on clay.  this time will it be different?
is there something in his game that bothers you?
how is your relationship with him now?
are you already starting to think about a possible final against federer?
we know all the players are supporting monte-carlo as a masters series.  does that mean you don't want shanghai to become a masters series?
i just want to know if you remember anything about your first ever against guillaume raoux?
right.  do you have any memories of that day and now?
do you still book your own practice courts?
what means this win for you?  i mean the way, you won.
was it always planned that tony was going to come here, roger?  was it always planned?
is he going to be in rome and all of the other tournaments?
what was be your schedule next week?
did you finally talk with ricci bitti about the davis cup?  what came out?  is it going to be the first week after the slams or not?
did he tell you something that surprised you or you knew everything?
what about yourself you can be surprised now on clay?  i mean, after this long improvement.
you can be surprised about yourself on clay?  you can play badly or not?  i mean, you are quite sure --
after 500 wins, roger, is there one particularly that still stands out?  of the 500 wins, is there one that particularly still stands out?
i think you pass the $30 million in earnings as well.
do you remember what your first paycheck was after toulouse?  so you remember what you put in the swiss bank?
francs?
you were the first top 10 player beaten by gasquet, and then he beat only two other afterwards:  blake and yesterday ljubicic.  are you surprised that he only beat three top 10 players in the last two years?  is this something that you would have expected or not?
what's your feeling of the game?  you score 12 games in a row.  did you have any rhythm for that?
what do you feel on clay is your best result?  even if you have got some good rhythm, but what is best ever?  how do you feel on clay?
do you adapt your game on clay, or not really?  you adapt a little bit?
the fact that you have already beaten federer and you almost always win against nadal, does it cause you more pressure?  i mean, do you have more pressure on yourself, or you always expect to win?  you disappoint when you lose, or not?
presuming nadal beats kohlschreiber, are you excited about the prospect of playing him again?
do you think you can beat him on clay?
we don't now a great deal about you.  do you prefer perhaps to be a little quieter, not in the limelight, rather than be in the headlines?  you seem like a quiet, shy kind of person.
scotland.
big difference.
so you would probably rather be as you are without the big hype all the time?
in the czech republic are you sort of a star that people stop you to sign autographs?
gossip papers write about you and lucie safarova and things like that, or you don't care?
who has more front covers, you or your girlfriend?
i mean, you're probably most regarded by some people for your gesture in madrid last year when it was a very interesting reaction to beating nadal.  did that make you, do you think, stronger as a person because of having to deal then with the reaction the next day, strengthened you as a person?
do you and rafa get on pretty well as two guys?  do you have a --
and with you and santoro it's better now?
are you the kind of player who thrives or enjoys a hostile atmosphere when the crowd is against you?  do you like that?
yeah.  can it make you stronger?
in your last two matches -- and certainly today -- you've been behind and have come back tremendously well.  how do you feel physically, because obviously the nadal match will be a very physical match.
when you need to practice and you want to find a partner to hit some balls you ask any player, or you have somebody you like better to play with?  and would you ask nadal one day, or you prefer not?
you won 21 points in a row.  you were pretty unstoppable there.  how confident is that level you're playing at?
sorry to move to a different subject, but you're going play an exhibition with roger in early may.  half clay, half grass; is that right?
on what surface?
because roger said one week ago that it was going to be only clay.  then it changed again?
what do you think about this exhibition?
how many people are there going to be?
it was a good test because chela was playing well and you were playing also very well?
we saw everything today.  we didn't see anything last night.  how was it?
first match on the clay.  how do you feel?
you had problem with your feet.  is it okay now?
is there anything different compared to last year or to the last two years when you start here?
the next game is against vliegen.
how important was it for you to hold the first game in the first set?
when so many of your shots keep on coming back, did you have to resist the temptation to hit harder and harder?  i mean, it's part of the clay court game:  you hit a great shot and it comes back.
how would you as assess gaudio's play, and did that affect your rhythm?
(question in french) gaudio is well-known because he's very good clay court player, but also because he's difficult to play because he complains all the time and sometimes he just gives up.  is there a sort of special preparation for playing against him?
(question in french) do you have a word to say about your next opponent?  it might be either benneteau or ferrer.  you played them both in indian wells recently.
(question in french) how is your physical condition?  are you fit?  because you were talking about the fact that clay is a different game, but it's also a physically different.  are you ready to play a marathon, a very long match?
when you saved the breakpoint at the start of the third set with the ace and it went really quickly, were you expecting a tougher third set?
(question in french) earlier you said having high goals on clay.  what are those goals you have for the season?
are you going to be the one who will beat nadal on clay?
do you think you can?
when did you find out that you were going play garcia-lopez, and did that change your mindset how you were going to play murray?
what did you have in mind before stepping onto the court?
what did you know about him?
what do you need now?
what are you going to do now?
what do you expect or not expect from tonight's meeting with et?
with the first match back on clay, how are you feeling?
he's quite an underrated player, seppi.
about nadal, after wimbledon, he improved his serve and volley play.  what will be his weak point to exploit?
his weak point for you to exploit?
have you spoken to etienne at all?  has he called you?
so did you actually speak to him?
after you failed to convert your first mathchpoint you seemed to lost the count, the result.
doesn't happen very often.
what was your reaction to the game of seppi?  i mean, were u more or less surprised by the way he played, or not?
your next opponent has had a couple good wins, lee.  what do you make of his game?
has there been any reaction to you -- you say you haven't spoken to etienne personally -- but to what you said yesterday and the way it was delivered?  has there been any reaction inside or outside tennis to what you said yesterday?
did you feel in sense relieved that you have got your grievances out in the open?
yeah.
when you said that you are a little bit disappointed that you didn't finish the match a little bit earlier, would you say it is worrying at the beginning of the clay court season, or was it just the fact that you didn't play for a long time on the clay?
is it just you meeting etienne tonight?
can you say which ones?
hot enough for you?
really?
talk about the match.  technically how did it go for you?
people would think that with your big serve you would do better on fast courts.
is it possible to make serve and volley, chip and charge on clay?
what is your opinion about the fact that you are the last of the mohicans?
how it's possible that this new passing shot that we didn't see ten years ago, how is it possible to make that?  how it's possible for them to suddenly play some passing shots that really troubles your game and that you wouldn't have seen ten years ago?
a guy like roger federer that like to serve and volley, come more to the net on clay, what would be your advice?
do you think he has a chance to win roland garros?
can you just explain us what's the pleasure to come on the net and play serve and volleying?
what should be made maybe of the regulation on the racquet or on the strings or on the court to emphasize -- to make that more people come to the net?
do you think they will remember max mirnyi as a hero?
federer and nadal have been making some fairly heavy comments about the political situation here at monte-carlo.  are you with that group who seem very critical of moves being made in the game?
what to do.  couple of volleys i suppose and you got breakpoints, you had breakpoints in the first set.  and then --
so you're going to play right away through to the french.  what are you playing?
when you played at roland garros a few years ago you had a really good first set.  how can you get a good start against him?
how much practice did you have, tim, for today?
how did it feel after davis cup?
just sort of dealing with the constant frustration?
because you knew it was going to be that way, but when it keeps happening i suppose it's frustrating.
apart from losing, did you enjoy being out there an center court?
i don't know if you were aware of roger and rafa's press announcement today, or their meeting today.
in terms of what the atp is trying to do -- and you've been in the midst of this -- what's your reading or your take on the kind of unified voice that the players have that they're not perhaps in the consultative process as much as they should be?
you said you sympathize with etienne.  do you feel that the atp is in safe hands?
no ideas yourself?
how much discussion has there been between the players?  how much have you spoken with roger or rafael?
was that a question of him playing perfect or you not establishing what you wanted to establish?
so you talk about coming in the other night about making aggressive shots, moving in.  when he's hitting without the top spin, it's tough to get in?
you almost seemed to get over ran sometimes.  you know, australia was a tough match.  it seemed like you were overeager, you were dying to get at these guys, and some how, it throws you off a little bit?
you've had a couple really tough matches with fernando verdasco, another spanish left-hander.  do you think it's the left-handed baseline game that maybe is challenging for you?
how tough is it to close points out at the net against him 'cause he passes unbelievably well?
is it surprising that he played so aggressively today, were you playing --
playing like that, could he beat federer?
if you were to play him again, say, next week, would you imagine having to do something different or doing what you did today better?
a little bit more of a touch game in there.  did that mess up his rhythm at all or mess you up more than him?
back to his serve, what you mentioned a little bit, is it spin and placement or is he hitting a little harder than you expected it his serve?
your game seems to be changing right in front of our eyes, basically over the months as you're incorporating different things and trying new things.  is that -- i mean, so is that match like a barometer for how you're coming along?  does it make you wonder about what direction you need to take now?
we don't know who's going to play in the final, but who would you give more chance, if he plays well like this, maybe djokovic or murray in the final?
did you watch murray last night?
what did you think?
is that part of his secret, to thoroughly confuse people?
is that an element to his game?  is it part of his game to confuse your position and then to beat you?
that aside, part of his strategy is to bamboozle the opposition, something that he does?
he does it better than anybody else?
better than 75 percent of the players?
so what were you thinking when he was sitting there having his ankle worked on for seven, eight, nine minutes?
is that annoying?
as an opponent, is that annoying?
can you give me an update on your charitable foundation?  is there anything happening this year?  what's the final total, because the book, you know, is up to your mom, i assume?
andy, in terms of davis cup, it will be a fresh new day there, 14, 15,000 screaming americans.  you'll be wearing the red, white, and blue, so to speak.  is that a fresh start and can you comment on that?
back to today's match.
was there any point you thought --
party pooper.  i'm sorry.
was there any point where you thought you could turn it around or did it go by so fast you really felt like you couldn't get it if you wanted?
do you feel like you're able to shake it off, though?  i mean, sometimes it looks like you get yourself going just a little bit and can you pull back any time before it disintegrates totally?
it looks sometimes like you get a little excited about the couple mistakes you make.  i wonder if that takes you over the edge and that game is gone?
which holyfield fight was it?
is it kind of right to assume that you were paying a bit of a price for last night today, physically?
the trainers tell you about the damage that you've done to yourself and whether you could do anymore damage if you played.
what exactly is the diagnosis on the ankle?
which bit hurts most and which bit are you most concerned about sort of going forward?
how bad did you feel when you woke up this morning?
have you ever felt that beaten up after a match?
on the plus side, though, andy, would you not say it was a week of progress, despite the happenings of last night and today?  would you say it was a progressive week for you?
andy, can you talk about the play novak djokovic, how he's been coming up.  you're both kind of on your way up.  can you talk about his recent success and comment on his play.
in terms of miami, how conservative are you going to be, how cautious are you going to be?  obviously you've got davis cup on the horizon.
andy, you and djokovic are the same age, 19 years and ten months old.  he said that you know each one since you were 12 years old.  when you're not injured like this, are you looking forward to your matches and creating somehow rivalry, you know, between you two and, you know, some kind of more flare in the future with him?
when is your, what are your plans immediately?  you go straight to miami?  you're going to stay here tomorrow?
when you said right at the start, andy, that you thought it was an unprofessional decision, was it your decision alone?  i mean, do you say, whatever anyone else is saying, i'm making this choice, i'm going out to play regardless of what anyone else might say?
andy, when you said a bit of an unprofessional decision on my part to go on, you're talking about going on today and not continuing last night, right?
you're not referring to your decision to play on last night despite your injury; you're talking about your unprofessional decision, then, was your decision to compete today?
right.  right.  that's my question.  what was michael's advice midway during the second set when he came over and had that long chat with you?  was it any different than what he said at the start, he felt you couldn't worsen it by carrying on play?
could i ask your take on tomorrow's final between nadal and novak?
is the level you saw today high enough to beat nadal, do you think?  i know it's hard to say with an injury.
just to change the subject.  have you been watching the cricket world cup?
today and throughout the tournament you made a statement here that you're certainly willing to win this tournament and as well to be counted very seriously in this season.  is that a fair statement?
what was the heat like out there for you today and how did it affect the flight of the ball?
is there pressure on a day like today to try and win quickly or do you feel like you can stay out there for three long sets?
marian vajda, your coach, and correct me if i'm wrong, he spent some time around here.  how does it help you to be around him and what did he bring to your game?
what effect has he on it?
what effect has he had?
does he think you should come to the net more?
with the association he's got, did it happen at the end of adelaide or during the tournament?
andy is playing tommy tonight, you know.  it's no guarantee that he'll get through, but you and andy are two guys that people keep talking about as the young guys.  do you look forward to maybe playing him?
do you feel that you are part of the new generation of young players?
there's a little bit of a feeling among some of us that you and andy are putting a little distance between yourselves and the rest of the pack.  is that accurate or do you feel that, as well?
and the other young guys who actually are pretty promising.
do you get along pretty well with andy off the court?  do you practice together a lot?
you're just 19 years and ten months.  coincidentally the same age as andy murray, but i'm sure, the kids in serbia look up to you even though they're still young.  what's the state of tennis in serbia today?  it's obviously coming up.  tipsarevic said hard courts are missing.  what do you think about that?
a lot of people use that sort of swinging volley to get to the net.  talk about getting into the net more.  is that a shot you like to use as a transition to the net or that's just an offensive shot to close out?
you got a little taste of the reporting side?
you got a little taste of the reporting side this week when you were reporting anna's match.  how did you --
was that about perseverance and patience, that win?
how important is it for you now to be able to pull out the big serves when you need it?
what were the differences between when you played him today and when you played him a year ago in terms of you?
were you particularly pleased at the end of the first set when you had those set points and then you broke and then you broke him back again and played such a good tiebreaker?  that was the nugget of the match the way you played at that particular time.
how hard is it to take a guy like him out of his rhythm, 'cause he can stay there from the back and hit cross-court backhands for an hour if he wants to?
who do you prefer gonzalez or haas for next?
who would you prefer gonzalez or tommy haas?
you played roddick last year, beat him.  you've also played him again recently this year.  is it your sense that mentally his confidence has come back.  he was playing at a higher level than maybe a few months ago?
do you sense a difference in him when you've played him recently?
outline a little bit more what you would have to do against tommy haas and what you would have to do against gonzalez.
i think you set a bit of a record today by challenging the very first point of the match?
i think it was an all-time first?
you won.  is that a sense of, right from the word go, your focus was so good today?  i mean someone could have, you know, might have of seen that and not been quite sure and immediately you knew it was?
do you think the hawkeye is wrong sometimes?
is it possible part of the ball hit the line and it didn't leave a mark, and that's what the hawkeye is recording?
do you see that as a problem?
do you think that your umpire should be able to overrule the hawkeye if the ball clearly shows...
you said the other day that you're not home enough to allow the pressure of what people are talking about back home get to you, but have you sought counseling or have people given counseling about not letting the pressure get to you?  has tim henman said anything, family, friends, just to avoid a lot of that?
where do you fall into those three?
so does that mean, bottom line, you're not going to talk about your mom's cooking anymore like you did at wimbledon?
has your comfort level grown with hawkeye?  is it fair to say that?
has your comfort level grown with using hawkeye?
well, when you first had, you know, the first time you went on court, it was new, you didn't really know when you were going to challenge?  i mean, like some players now are stopping in the middle of points when they see a ball, whereas in the past, they weren't comfortable to stop the point if they thought it was out.  they'd continue to play.
if the guy in the chair can overrule a hawkeye, why even have it?
if the chair umpire can overrule hawkeye, why have hawkeye there?
did you and brad have a certain strategy today to take pace off?  and you're hitting a lot of roofing balls.  it seemed like davydenko was having trouble with that slower pace?
you had so many matches.  you've had quite a few matches this year where, you know, you've gone down and then managed to come back and win, and sometimes your opponent didn't quit.  how is it you're able to outlast some of your on opponents?
so do you think it's a mental thing or a physical thing?
what is worse, the heat here in indian wells or the heat at the australian open?
and at the australian open, when you made some remarks about how the players were treated or not treated during the intense heat, did that result in any changes to the way matches were conducted in really hot weather?
so you're talking about playing on the shady courts and the outside courts?
can you explain that a little bit more.  you're talking about people who are playing on the outside courts?
one would think that as fit as you seem to be, you would welcome the heat.
you do have a history of making a lot of rallies -- this woman's question just addressed (indicating question at beginning of press conference.)
in today's match in, i think it was 4-all in the first set, there was a problem with the tennis balls.  do you know what happened?
did it affect the level of play or --
how could they do that?  i mean, they only have one brand of balls for the tournament; right?
right.
i know you're in another section of the draw, but how much of a golden opportunity does it present to guys like you when federer goes out early in a tournament like this?
yesterday, canas was asked the secret to beating federer, and he said he didn't know.  what's your secret to beating roger?
does it change the mind set of the guys in the locker room at all when you see him lose?  is everybody a little bit more up for this tournament?
this seems to be a very good week for the players from argentina.
have you noticed that?
how surprised were you that canas could beat federer, if you were surprised at all?
davis cup seemed to be such a big goal for you.  has it always been that way throughout your career?
where does it stand in terms of things you want to achieve in your career?
another very quick, very comfortable win.
do you feel like you mixed it up pretty well?
so davydenko possibly.  just talk about that.
does it alter the perspective of a tournament when roger goes out so early?  does it give the tournament a whole new kind of -- go into anything differently at all?
were you surprised when you heard that federer went out in his first match to a lucky loser?
for many months you were famous as the last guy to beat roger federer.  that no longer applies.  is that disappointing to you or do you welcome it?
is there a certain amount of relief that you perhaps won't get asked about it quite as much?
canas was asked how he beat roger yesterday and he laughed and said, i don't know.  what do you think the game plan is for beating roger?  i think in the past, you said just play your normal game.  but what are your thoughts on the approach to take?
who's the favorite in this tournament now that roger is out, in your mind?  is there one?
would you put yourself in that bracket as well?
you've had the good fortune to work with brad now for a number of months, and one of his attributes, of course, has been one of the best talkers in all of tennis.  what have you learned about american sports from brad over the past months?
when he and graybow were working with you up in the bay area, did he introduce you to davis or -- baron davis or mullen or any of the warriors?
do they know what a great tennis player you are?
does davydenko make you play more offensive, his style?
what if it's not davydenko and it's hernych?
what went wrong today for you?
it couldn't have been easy to come off court at what, midnight last night, and what time did you get to sleep and then have to come back out?
you seemed pretty flat coming out.  do you think that was part of just not really being awake?
having said all that, what was your mind-set heading into the tiebreaker?
the tournament's lost a lot of seeds?
sometimes you just have a couple crazy days.
how would you assess your year?
i know it's a moot point, but what was your first, immediate thought when roger lost yesterday?
so did you view it as a huge opening for yourself at your next slot, saying --
at what point does leaving some matches on the table start to get into your head a little bit?
just, you know, your level, at sort of, you know -- you hit a point where the range was not very high.  it seemed like in the last few weeks, you know, that range has widened a bit.  is that just the ebbs and flows of pro-life or is there anything else going on?
was that expected, to pull an upset over the no.1?
what does this mean to you considering everything you've gone through?
what's it say?
what does this mean to you, considering everything you've gone through?
do you think guillermo vilas is going to send you a thank you note?
can you take us through what happened is your last match in qualifying to now?
did you feel you had it you went to 5-2?
is it the key that you, correct me if i'm wrong, have a positive score against him now?  are you now 2-1 against federer in the matches?
most of the players before when they come to the court to play with him, they kind of lose their head, so to speak, get beaten before.  but maybe that's the key of your success today.
did you notice any difference in the way he was moving after the trainer came out and taped his feet or anything?
the second time he called for the trainer you had a 3-2 lead and i assume that you were anxious to get on with it, right, you're ahead, let's go?  what did you think about him calling for the trainer at that point?  do you think that might have had -- he might have been engaging in any gamesmanship right there?
did you come back a more motivated player after this suspension?
considering all that you've been through over these past years, to come back, to beat the dominant no.1 player, who many say is the best ever, is that particularly sweet and does that give you any kind of feeling at all of vindication?
there were points in the second set in which the velocity of your serve dropped off markedly.  you weren't serving quite as swiftly.  were you suffering or did you have any physical problems?
yeah.
you had a lot of serves measured close to 130 miles an hour, but you had points in that second set when you were serving like 78.
can you just talk about how unwelcome you were on the atp tour during your suspension, how you tried to get in to watch your girlfriend play at the u.s. open in 2005 and weren't allowed on the grounds.
well, you mentioned that story earlier.
when you were suspended, was there one player or official outside of your immediate support group who came forward and was particularly supportive?
yes, for you.
and you were also very unhappy with your first lawyer, the way he represented?
are you as happy now as you were as a kid?  once you mentioned that, '86 and the one argentina world cup, are you as happy now as you were then?
did you have to set new goals when you came back or could you keep the same goals that you had before?
but the goals you had set maybe when you were a teenager, a young person, maybe, winning grand slams or being no.1 is still --
getting back to a more happy time, i didn't understand the specifics.  you were given a drug by a trainer?
by the doctor?
i see.  it was something you didn't know about?
your cold?
and how does this work, then?  do they just come and knock on your door and say, "we have a test and you're not eligible for 15 months"?
so you were told you had to go back and think, "what was i doing five months ago"?
just following up on that, how have you been treated since you've come back?  are you tested more regularly than some of your colleagues?  are you drug-tested more often, is that fair, or how often?
yeah.  how is it going?
could you tell us how hard have you been working to come back?
can you put it in perspective how devastating financially it was for you being out that long?
can you put it into numbers now?
for a year or two or more, the big question in men's tennis is how do you beat federer.  and if had you had to tell someone how you do beat roger federer, what would you say?
just judging by the score, it looked fairly easy.  how was it out there?
easier than you expected?
you had a lot of support in the crowd today.  is there any extra pressure, the hometown?
i didn't get a chance to see it.  they said some of the people in the crowd were wearing like outfits or something for your matches?
flutes?
what's it like returning to the desert?  i know you've had success out here as a junior and you had your first win here last year.
what is it about the desert that you like?
how would you say you're kind of different this year compared to last year when you came into this tournament?
how would you assess your year so far, say if you had to give yourself a letter grade?
a minus?
what was your grade point in high school in thousand oaks?
yeah.
who was the guy you lost to who is not a top 10 player?
yeah, i know who he is.
i see you're playing with your shoe.  what happened with your shoe at the australian and your dialogue with james?  what was that about?
a media frenzy over nothing?
who got the shoes?  were they up on the --
he wanted the shoe?
okay.  speaking of important objects in your life, can you talk about your vw van?  do you still have it?
has a nice vibe to it?
did you see, what's it called, little miss sunshine?
the shoes, really quick, is there a reason why you picked the boom, i think, over like the barricade?
feather?
recently andy said you've a good shot to be top 30 in the rankings.  would you be satisfied with that or do you have your sights set higher?
overall.
do you think your chances are pretty decent?
you talk about your confidence.  young player comes into the tour, all these names who play for years and years, it's pretty daunting situation, but then you get some wins this year, a decent tournament there.  what's that process like with confidence?
can you talk about your next match.  i believe it's davydenko.
i haven't been to all your matches, but have you actually been able to get into people's heads and really unnerve your opponent?
you mean vince actually had something to say (laughter)?
can you talk about the atmosphere out there today.  have you ever played on court 6 out there?  it was kind of out in the hinterlands?
could you talk about davis cup for a minute.  i mean, most every young player who's coming on strong thinks a little bit about it.  even though we have roddick and blake locked in pretty good, in the back of your mind is that something you'd really like to do?
i know you've had some involvement with patrick.  is he talking to you on a regular basis or...
you had quite a run the past few six months.  can you talk about your come-back.
are you the kind of a guy who believes in signs, in omens, perhaps you being a lucky loser in this event would be a suggestion that things are going to start going real well for you?
very tough.
they told you, i assume, that you would be a lucky loser; right?
later you found out that, well, maybe you're not really all that lucky.  you've got to play federer in the next round.
it is lucky huh?
have you had other matches against roger?
do you remember the score in the toronto match?
what's the key to beating roger?
what do you remember about the last match and what do you remember about doing well that enabled you to win that match?
the last time, when you beat roger in toronto.  what do you remember about that match?
is it really possible to fully reestablish yourself in tennis after you've been out for 15 months?
it is, huh?
you're doing it?
how strong does that feel that you beat at the bra sill january open []  -- was there some strong players in that tournament?
ferrero?
i watched the beginning of your match today and i noted that when you were introduced, you were warmly received; you were applauded and so forth.  does that feel pretty good?
are you going to try to take the position that you have nothing to lose?
right.  yeah.
you had a positive drug test in 2005, and you were given that substance by tournament officials.  do you feel vindicated that the court of arbitration for sport reduced that suspension?  does that make you feel vindicated?
can you talk a little bit about how difficult it was during these 15 months to keep your play level high?
you were not allowed to go to tournaments?
is that the workout you expected today?
are you worried with facing three-set matches?
in the second set, it looked like you were struggling a little to move to the right, to your forehand.  was that hip-related or were you just a little fatigued?
when did you --
when did you have the hip operation and how is it now?
2004?
what was it like to be away from the game for so long?  how much did you miss tennis?
following up on that, when you started back and went to the challenger level, what was it like being back at that juncture where it all started for you all those years ago?
what were you thinking when some of the guys who you used to compete against like, corretja and agassi and more your generation were retiring?  were you thinking, "maybe i should just retire with them and not come back and play against the young guys"?
when you were watching nadal win roland garros the last two years and you were the best player at roland garros over the decade, you had your three, and when you're watching nadal, were you thinking, "maybe i can't beat this guy, maybe my body will never get me to the point where i can play that kind of clay court, great clay court tennis at roland garros again"?
in your most difficult days when you were off the tour, what did you dream of?  what did you -- what was the one or two things you dreamed of?
how about the state of tennis in brazil.  someone of your stature may do something to do changes.  do you have plans like that some day?
in the research center, we looked at injuries and the majority of injuries have taken place on people who hit off the back foot, and we did quite an analysis of your game, and it places several hundred pounds of force on the hip and knee and ankles.  are you concerned that it might happen again with the new hip?
could you talk about what it would mean to brazil if it ended up hosting the olympics.  i know rio has made a very strong bid for the games in 2016.  what it would mean to latin america considering the olympics have never been there?
will you be playing in the davis cup in april?
do you fear canada?
where would you put federer against the great players that you've played?
do you think the level in the top 10 right now is significantly higher than when you left with your injury?
i know the other night you said it would be a lot of fun playing james, but it seemed a little strange out there, at least to me watching it.  there wasn't a lot of electricity.  was it nerves playing him or something?
you never found the rhythm on your serve.  talk about that.
when you know someone so well are you making more errors because you're thinking you have to put the ball right in the same spot?
do you think there are enough years for james to have every lived with beating you on a challenge, if he gets that challenge at the very end and wins a match?
can you just talk about the week in general.  i mean, what it means for you confidence-wise, emotionally, all that.
there's been two all-american finals in the last three weeks and four in the last four years.  is there any reason?  is it just a coincidence?
yeah, washington and here.
did the u.s. have to learn to be an underdog, as a mentality?
can you compare the emotion of this match to when you played roddick in australia and what you felt like out there emotionally?
did you and james talk to each other before the match at any time?
was it strange walking out on the court right before the match?
going to stick him with a big check tonight?
you won here before.  what was your best case scenario of this week?
were one of those matches the key, one of the earlier round matches really got the confidence soaring?
is blake ever going let you forget this match?
if you don't feel this way now, what do you think you need to achieve and what do round you think you need to get to in the next couple tournaments to be included in the american box of tennis like you said you were okay with?
did the heat take a lot out of you?
did you feel bad during the match as well on the court?
you had beaten him five times before.  was there something different he was doing?
four times.  did he do anything differently today?
no, mardy.
did he get more balls back on your serve than he usually does when you play him?
he won over 70% points on your second serve.  do you think that was the key to the match, him attacking your second serve?
did you even consider we were on deadline?
pretty routine win there?
looks like he plays like you play:  big forehand, chases a lot of balls down.  is that a fair assessment?
can you explain you thought process when you're up 40-15 and you lose those two match points and how you recover from that?
talk about your emotion when the last ball fell out there.
playing mardy, was that motivation at all?
you going let the j block loose again?
is it true the last time mardy was up here was to go to a 4th of july picnic at your house in fairfield?
is there anything about your game that he doesn't know?
is there any surprise at all?
does your girlfriend do a game show, too?
just talk about the match, what went wrong.
is it disappointing, or did you feel like you got enough work in for next week?
where do you rate the open as far as the majors?  where does it rank with you?  what is your favorite major i guess would be the question?
what's was wrong with your leg?  did you have another injury recently?
tough getting loose in this weather:  cold, damp?
which leg is it?
what will do now, go new york and start getting ready?
do you think you need a few days to rest your leg and not practice?
how was your day?
obviously part of playing at your level is when you can be, you know, that really far down and come back to here so quickly.
what's your thought process when he goes 40-love, three serves to win the match?
watching you between the two matches today you seemed like two different players from the start.  did you feel that way?
we talk a lot about the j block and the support they give you.  but this afternoon when you're facing match point like that and they're still cheering for and you willing you on, can you talk about that and how that got you going, i would think, in the third set?
he wasn't willing to talk about the altercation at the end of that first match.  was there something that you can tell us about that happened during that match?  was he getting some coaching from his coach?
verdasco is a very dangerous player.  can you just talk about the way you were able to almost take it to him almost from the getgo?
does the j block rattle some of these guys?
talk about having two americans in the semifinals on the hard courts and how this hard court season is going into the us open for the americans.
it seemed like you've almost brought the americans together.  do you sense that at all?
you first match today was very similar to mardy's:  struggled the first tow sets and then the third set just a runaway.  did you talk about that at all?
if simon or if it's mathieu, can you give us a little run through if you have to play those guys in the next round, the strength of each one?
today mardy mentioned that he was okay with not being put into the box of american tennis.  why do you think he feels that way, and why is that the case?
when you have a day like today and you have two matches and a real long match first one, how big is it to get the second one of over in an hour like you did?
were you worried that j block wouldn't be able to sustain themselves for a whole day?
did you discuss with golfers how they go against tiger, and you guys with federer?  you kind of have that in common.  does it cast the same shadow?
do you feel any pressure coming into it tournament specifically because you are kind of the poster boy for the pilot pen?
did you expect him to come out so hard right off the bat?
did you expect djokovic to come out so hard from the first set?
did you expect him to be so aggressive?
how was your knee today?
your knee?
how did you feel about the way you played today?
did you feel you were moving as well as you would like to?
i want to ask you a question:  i saw you with the real madrid team for the last game of the season they won.  your father used to play for barcelona.
no?  that's what i had read somewhere?
your uncle played for barcelona.  so, how come you're a real madrid fan?
you had some very tough match in the last round, how do you feel physically tonight?  you feel fatigue or?
you talked to the referee a couple of times.  do you think it's useful to talk to the referee after he's made his call?
you talked to the referee after he make his call.  do you think it's useful to do that?
so you got a time warning, but djokovic takes a long time to serve, too.  do you think he should have gotten some?
you didn't?
i was wondering if your new doubles partner, lleyton hewitt, has he taught you any aussie expressions?
are you playing doubles in cincinnati?
i think you're now 12-2 since the beginning of july, one of the hotter players on the tour.  what's changed for you?  what's kind of sparked this?
"staying patient."  after you were serving for the match, he broke you.  is that an example of staying patient?
is the worm an ordinary finishing move for you?
have you felt a response from the crowd to your emotion?
we saw you once having fun with the balls, when you kick it, it bounced to your head.  is that something that helps you to get off a bit of pressure?  do you do that normally?
you might play next against federer.  have you played him?
do you feel you're more confident now?
what is it like playing roger, being on the other side of the net from him?
you might be the only unseeded player in the semifinals.  is that an advantage, knowing that you have nothing to lose, you can just go out there and play a little looser?  can you play loose in that situation?
when you were going through that rough stretch, what was the reason for it?
you have no problems now with the injury?
yesterday you were jumping on one leg next to the net.  did it represent something?
do you like to make fun on the courts a lot?
did you change before the injury and after?  do you feel you have changed a little bit?
person, player or?
what was the worst moment after you got injured?
do you remember when you started to feel the hand again, like maybe it was going to come back?
do you know how you got injured?
so did you just wake up one day and all of a sudden...
is that right?
what was it like when you were able to start opening doors, lifting up plates?
you said you enjoyed regular life.  what was that like after so many years?
do you still have treatment for your injury?
he always traveled with you?
you don't do that any more?
how difficult was it to be out of the top hundred?
did you ever watch tennis when you were out?
do you think you are a better player now than last year at the same time?
but before the injury...
so do you think doing the worm is a good idea?
during the injury, did you watch more women's or the men's?
you said you did the worm at rotterdam.  must be dirtier on the clay.
what was it like to play him again today two years later?  has he changed?  have you changed?
is it pretty hard to get away from his forehand?
anybody else on the tour that's at all similar to him?
a couple of times where you look like you hit a quite decent return, he'd still step into it, smash it down the line.
after this match can you judge a little bit how close you are of going back to no.1?
you consider yourself improving?
how do you evaluate your performance in general in this tournament?
just as a tennis player, forget about the crowds, the money, is there a satisfaction or something about playing him as a player, to measure against him, have the thrill of playing that high level in the game?
according to the official data, you won two-thirds of the points on his second serve.  is it something you can build on for your match-up against him?  also is there something he needs maybe a bit to improve to make sure to win the tournament here?
having to play him, having your coach be a guy that coached him three months ago, did that in any way change or help you?  how did that play into the match today?
it's been two and a half years you haven't met lleyton.  shouldn't it have been a tougher match, a tighter match?
stepanek you've played three times on clay, 2-1 with him.  what are your feelings tomorrow?
we know you don't like hawk-eye.  on that serve today, when you look up and you see it's out by virtually nothing, what goes through your head?
if the ball is out by that much, do you ever wonder how the lines person can call it out?
is it something the players just accept?
hawk-eye itself.  when it is such a close call, do you think to yourself, okay, just accept it, move on?
you still see some people take it up with the umpire.
analyzing your game, you served very good and you returned serve from roddick very good.  but from the baseline, basically, you didn't play aggressively with unforced errors, and you basically waited for roddick's mistakes?
did you get used to roddick's serve after you had seen it a few times?
if nadal wins, which is, you know, he's favored to do, so you're going to have a totally different challenge ahead of you.  and considering he stopped you on a couple of big occasions recently, can you talk about the perspective of this?
what do you know about dancevic?
how would you judge the way you're playing right now compared to where you were in miami and earlier in the year?
how did you become friends with frank?
mixed emotions after playing a great player so well for so long?  one respect that you played at a high level, but obviously disappointed?
hard to play a long match over your shoulder all the time?
that's another thing?
what did you do in the first set that you didn't do in the second and the third?
quite a battle out there.
how did you feel about your game today?
take us to the two match points you saved in the second set tiebreak.
what about playing roger, your old friend?
you made a reference the other day to your ranking not being that important.  roger said the same thing today, that even though you're not ranked high, everybody respects you.  you're more dangerous than your ranking.
does the rank -- do you care about the ranking any more?
when you reached no.1 at a young age, do you have the feeling then that you are going to be there for a while?  do you have any sense of how hard it is to stay up there?  roddick at 21, you were younger when you reached no.1.
there's probably a sense of you don't have the perspective you might have if you got to that ranking at 25.
the trajectory is up, up, up, you're there, you think, i'm going to stay here.
with regards to rafa, he has accumulated more points at no.2 than a lot of guys had at no.1.  do you think that's something the public sort of doesn't get, how really good he's been as a no.2?
roger, what does an 18-minute first set tell you about your game?
are you hitting the form that you want at the right time, i mean after only two matches?
does that kind of match test you at all?  does it push you in any way?
when you're in command of a match like that, do you actually try different things or work on something?
considering how many tournaments you play and how deep you tend to go in these tournaments, how important in the overall sense is a 45-minute match at this point of the week to be able to conserve energy for the more important matches later on?
do you watch other matches during the tournament at all?
nadal at all in particular?
are there any drawbacks to a short match?
you have the possibility of playing hewitt.  what is your feeling about that, former world no.1?
do you see any difference in the way he approaches matches and tournaments these days?
yeah, he seems to have picked himself up in the last six months or so.
any preference tonight on your opponent?  you have roddick, obviously, the higher seed.  fun for you to play him.
seems like you like the surface here.  some of the players have said it's one of the faster courts.  are you starting to like it, get the feel of it, high bounces?
you have a pretty nice ranking right now.  do you believe you can improve it?  when?  when do you believe is going to be the first grand slam?
when do you think?
your coach is from slovakia.  what kind of influence does he have on your game?  how does he help you?  do you fight sometimes?  did you play some matches with him?
your friend, ana ivanovic, won here last year.  it was a breakthrough for her.  obviously you're not in the same situation because you're already a top five player.  since you're saying you play with a lot of confidence right now, are you looking to make it two in a row for serbia in montral?
did you feel also that confident or the same level of confidence when you won in miami?  do you feel as good or even better at that point of the tournament compared to the masters series you won earlier this year?
can you tell us about what this means to you.
you're the first canadian to get this far since 1989, grant connell and andrew sznajder.  what does that mean to you?
nadal tomorrow.
does the fact that you beat roddick last week give you confidence against nadal?
do you or did you have travel plans to get to cincinnati by saturday morning?
what about your plans to play the semifinal here on saturday?
the fan support late in the third set, energy seemed to build.  you seemed to feed off it every point.
at what point did you really start to think you could or were going to win that match?
did you take a peek over there, with the trainers, what was happening?
where did you learn to speak french so well?
speaking of your family, i called your grandmother last week.
yes.  she gave me a half-hour long lecture of the pronunciation of your last name.
she says not dance-vik.
i'm wondering what she told you before you came here.
yes.
like she did every time?
how do you want your last name pronounced?
so there's two chich's?
what kind of cookies?
four wins so far here in the tournament.  i guess it's exceeded expectations to this point.  how do you feel at this point right now into the third round?  is this as deep as you've ever been in a masters series?
andy murray obviously had a bit of a wrist problem.  he's a high-ranked player.  you took care of business on your end.
more than likely a match-up with the world's no.1.  in your wildest dreams, did you think that would happen?
the name fabio, is it short for something else?
what part of italy are you from?
do you think karlovic could be a top player if he could return better the serve from his opponent and play better from the baseline?  against you today he didn't make one point from the baseline rallies.
what did you think when you saw your first match coming back was against him?
how pleased are you with the way you played?
did it take you long to come down from the high of wimbledon?
was it more of a relief with all the pressure building up?
the gale you played andre in the us open a few years ago, how were the windy conditions today?
you knew he was a great server.  what strategy did you have in mind before playing him?
what do you think of the way the draw has opened up with blake, gasquet...
how difficult was it to play on your birthday?  the public started singing "happy birthday" at 5-4 in the first.
pete sampras used the same model racquet throughout his career.  contractually do you have to change when they come out with a new model.  is that difficult to adjust?
how was your foot today?
what kind of thing?
is it a blister, a cut, a bruise?
how close were you to not playing today?
how does it feel now after the match?
is it an injury that will need you to take some time off at some stage?
what is your reaction to the whole thing that came out last week?
what has the reaction been from other players?  have they been supportive towards you?
how did you first hear about it?  how did it come to your ears?
you read it in the newspaper or somebody called you?
have you been interviewed by anybody from the atp or from the betting agency about the situation?
how has it affected your preparation for this tournament?
you said it was disappointing for this story to break.  did it affect your preparation at all?  was it a distraction?
have these last couple months been probably the most stressful in your career, the most trying period?
what is your reaction in general to the idea that somebody would throw a match?
not just you yourself.  but in general, in the sport, is it a surprise to you to hear that people might be making money from players with injuries, losing deliberately?
some players have said they've received phone calls from people offering money to throw a match.  have you ever received a phone call like that?
you've never been in contact with anyone like this?
how would you explain it?
there seemed to be a lot of betting right during the match, so it was very unusual.  do you know how or why that would happen?
along that line, considering what you've gone through, what does that say about yourself, that you were able to get through a pretty difficult match?
did you find it at all unusual you were playing on such a small court, being that you're a high-ranked player, considering everything that's gone on?
did you have to get a lawyer just to help you?
is there any way that you can think of to stop this kind of thing happening?
what's the difference in the courts, from 5 to 9?  why did your brother say the court was different?
is it a lot different?
slower?
how much of a factor was the wind out there today?
that shot in particular looked like you short-hopped it between your legs.  could you ever imagine making a shot like that in that situation?
once you had a few of the miss-hits with the wind, did that make you back off a little bit, feel your way through?
do you feel yourself getting more comfortable in the environments like you were today?
as far as playing those top players, finding success, the confidence that must come from that.
what do you know about verdasco?
you've had two seeds fall out in front of you.  do you feel lucky?
particularly on that one side, did you feel you were tempted when you made approach shots?
yes.
something in practice?  something that's lingering?  tweaked on the court?
one of the major reasons why you wanted to shut it down, one rip could cause some damage?
when did you take the decision?
are you going to have treatment in montral or cincinnati?
have you had many walkovers in your career?  can you think of any?
have you had any?
is it better or worse that you had the walkover before you have to play rafael?
you've been playing quite a lot this summer, haven't you?
how about playing rafa?  never played him before.
a guy like that, that you've seen play all these years, you never played him, do you have a natural curiosity, some ideas how you would play against him?
you're not looking for that experience?
like when guys play against you?
can you go in as an underdog with nothing to lose?
if you win, that would boost your confidence.
how do you feel about your game right now?
what to you make of the gambling investigation going on?
not for you?
do you feel like the atp is doing what it needs to do?
you don't care that it possibly could be viewed as hurting the integrity of the sport?
does it surprise you to hear that kind of thing might happen in tennis?
a few years ago you were giving your sister a hard time.
in australia.
now is she giving you a hard time?
why not?
you said this has been an unremarkable season for you.  how do you feel about that?  do you feel frustrated?  is it just kind of a depressing thing?
you've expressed frustration in the past when you haven't played as well as you want to.
you're kind of lucky to have caught the train without the wife and kids on it.
you're assuming a lot.
now that you've had a match and a win, do you feel more confident about the future?
did you feel tentative at the start?  you seemed to grow in self-belief.
were you surprised to win that?  you didn't hit too many big forehands.  were you surprised to win, given that?
is it something that's going to hurt for a few matches or ease as it goes along?
how does it work?  the doctors say it will actually strengthen the more you actually do it in a slow progression?
what was it about this tournament that made you decide to play whereas last week you decided against it at a late stage?
did you consider pulling out of this one, as well?
you grimaced in the first game of the second set after you hit a forehand.  was that some sort of pain?
how much does that worry you?
how much did you miss being away?  must have been anxious to get back.
do you have a feeling of happiness?  are you happy to be back in your job, back among all the tennis players?
you talked about improving your ranking.  since like the top two spots are practically untouchable right now, how do you feel as a player?
both of them have mentioned you and djokovic as guys who could make a run at them.  you have a bit of a history together.  do you see it the same way?
djokovic.
do you have any regrets about wimbledon, trying to get the wrist ready to play there?  do you think you might have gotten back sooner if you hadn't pushed it?
are you going to take it day-to-day or do you already have yourself a goal set?
looked like a most innocuous shot that caused the injury.  do you know how and why it came about?
you've been working with brad gilbert for a year and a half now.  how would you describe your relationship with him?  and did he convert you to american football?
nicolas kiefer can be an unusual player to play sometimes.  he goes in great spurts, can come up with these amazing shots, then sometimes goes away.  how did you find the match?
how long did it take after wimbledon for all the injuries to get better?
what is your favorite surface?
you said you didn't expect to rise as quickly.  what did you expect?
you've risen to 3.  pretty long list of guys who held that no.3 spot since rafa became no.2.  a lot of people think you're going to be the guy to break the lock on those two spots.  do you think that?
as a player, how do you live with the fact that the top two spots are practically untouchable?
forget about roger and rafa as players.
what do you like about them as people or personalities?
you really don't want to talk about the underwear thing?
was it planned?  did you go in there expecting to do it?
how much money did you and james agree to?
what's the funniest reaction you've had from the other players?
this tour can be such a grind.  there's so much work.  you seem to have a lot of fun with it.  is that what for you gets you from place to place?
do you try to get out into the cities you visit?
do you think he was just a little bit better than you or were there other factors, like your hand, stuff like that?
on the set point, you missed one of those backhand returns.
do you think it was because you were going for too much; he hit a good serve?
towards the end, you seemed to have a cramp in your leg.
they talk about learning from losses and stuff like that.  what did you learn today?  can you tell right after a match or is it something you have to think about?
what happened to your hand in the first set?
some bad luck?
where do you go from here?
do you feel like you're a little worn down, seven straight weeks?
how would you sum up your progress so far this year?
you'll be able to get into a few challengers without qualifying.  will that make it a little easier?
how does it feel for a qualifier to beat the no.10 in the world?
berdych said you played extremely well.  what exactly did you do let's say better than usual?
where does it rank for you in terms of career victories?
where does it rank for you?
best win you ever had?
do you think having played two qualifying matches gave you an edge over him, being warmed up?
now that you've beaten the no.10 seed, do you feel you have a little bit more energy?
you said the physiotherapists helped you out.  was it a specific injury?
you've played five straight weeks?
qualifying over the weekend?
do you know the date today?
it's the 6th.  nice try.
you have a day off on the 7th.
how does it feel to be the youngest champion in the 23-year-old history of this prestigious event?
that sixth game of the second set, 22 points, so many deuces, that one, to actually win that game, how important was that in the way the match went?
did you plan out -- had you thought about in your mind what you would say if you win?  i mean, it seemed very poised and mature for someone who was winning a first big tournament.  is that something you had imagined in your mind or was that spontaneous?
where did you succeed where roger federer twice failed last month?
where did you succeed, what was the difference, why were you able to beat him where roger could not?
do you feel that the level of your play is right up there with federer and nadal?  obviously you beat nadal this week?
what was it like hearing yourself being introduced by butch saying, "tennis has a new star"?
it's so important these days, i think, to be different, to have different elements in your game, different variety of shots.  you used the drop shot both against murray and today, and your volley in the last week has been tremendous.  how important do you think those elements are to being a bit different, to being something a bit special?
was it your idea to bring in mark as an assistant, or was that your coach's idea?
talk about the feeling of getting that final point, and you lay on the court.  what's going through your head?  was that a relaxation or --
you've been in two masters series finals in a row.  were you as nervous going into this final, or was it a different kind of nervousness?
did you feel a little more pressure because maybe this time you're a little more favored going into the match?
you initiated the hug.  usually it's the spanish that initiate the hug.
can you talk about that just a little?  you obviously showed him a lot of support.  and you said in the speech, after everything he had been through.  what do you feel about your opponent today?
in indian wells you lost to nadal, you lost in the finals.  this time around you beat nadal and win in the finals.  strategically, mentally what changes did you make from indian wells to here?  what was the biggest difference you felt in yourself?
in the past you've had some issues with breathing problems on the court.  is that done, finished?  or is that still an issue for you?
so now you're on this run, and moving to clay, what are your thoughts and expectations going to the clay season?
you talked about how you learn from your losses.  how do you do that?  do you watch tape, do you talk, what do you do?
serbia doesn't have much of a tennis history.  are you proud of what you're doing?
did you talk to monica after the match, monica seles?
does your play this month and caas' wins over federer give you a little bit more hope that maybe you or someone else could actually take over the no.1 spot from roger this year?
why did you give your racquet away, and how did you choose who to give it to?
how have you managed your emotions better on court?  it seems like there's a difference between last year and this year?
but have you -- in a moment where you might have smashed your racquet last year, do you stop and think?  or how do you manage it?
was there any suspicion, it looked from upstairs as if you were struggling a little bit with your movement today.  or is that not right?
have you ever had anybody hit so many drop shots against you?
andy, i know you don't want to make excuses.  let's just clarify, you didn't have any problems with your groin injury?
what makes him a tough player for you?
it looked to me today, andy, as if novak was in a very, very patient mood.  maybe that got to you a little bit, that he was prepared to hang tough with you on the baseline and just not give you any free points.  did that really get to you after a while?
those early backhand errors on balls that were just basically rally balls, did you have a sense early in the match that something was not right today?
is there any point during a match like that where you just can't wait for it to be over?  or do you still stay as focused all the way to the end?  or is there a point where you just know that it's kind of a lost cause?
did you feel you were fighting hard through the whole match?
on a broader note, this is the second match and event in a row you made it to the semis, and obviously you're rising up the ranks.  can you reflect a little bit on him and you and your generation starting to make your move up the ranks?
a loss is a loss, andy.  but is it embarrassing to be a professional and have to go through that?  what is the feeling?
two 19-year-old prodigies going toe-to-toe at the end of such a prestigious tournament, one would expect a more impressive match than 6-1, 6-0.  was it just a case you were in the zone or --
it's not necessarily the case, but when you do see someone with a drop shot as often as this, it is easy to suspect that the player may know something about the general fitness of the player on the other side of the net.  do you know anything about andy's fitness?
i mean injury, whether he might have been possibly injured?
what do you think it is in your game the last few weeks that's helped you start to play so --
were you aware he had any physical discomfort?
were you aware andy had any physical discomfort?
he didn't use it as an excuse.
have you ever played a better match start to finish than this one?
you have so much to your game, so many ways to play, so many styles, is it easy to know at age 19 what to use in which situation out there?
do you ever see serving and volleying, do you think you'll ever do that?
what is it with you and hats?  indian wells you were taking them off and on.
you try it sometimes; you put it on and take it off in the changeover?
what kind of match did you anticipate today?
what did you think was going to happen before the match?  what were you anticipating?
what would your thinking be a year ago; okay, you're going to be in two masters finals a year hence?
so you're happy just to be in the finals now?
if it's ivan, despite the difference in your ages, do you know him well?
what year?
when?  when?
of course, tomorrow is going to be -- well, sunday i should say, it is going to be a best-of-five set final.  with this easy result that you have, and perhaps maybe this evening's match going to three sets, that gives you a particular advantage, doesn't it?
what is the attitude of the guys in the locker room toward caas, have they welcomed him back from the suspension?  do people have any doubts?  roger made some pretty strong remarks in indian wells about it.
have you played him?
where did you get the vibration dampener?
the vibration dampener?
how many drop shots will we see on sunday in a five-set match?
how many did you hit against rafa, drop shots?
rafa?
luby, pretty clean match.  couple of burps early in the second set but you got through those?
i don't know if it's important to you to keep track of the fastest serve, but you did have a 140 today.  have you ever hit 140 before?
was this a good opponent for you?  chela's a little impatient at times?
yeah, you keep the ball in the court?
they mentioned something the other day on tv about you starting some sort of davis cup petition with 20 other players?
not at roland garros though, right?
is this something formal?  is it something in writing?
itf hear you out?
we saw the full impact of your game today, the power of your big serve, but also the high topspin, the deep shots, the great backhand slice.  how long did it take to you develop all this stuff?
you have a way of lulling players almost to sleep with these slice cross-court backhanded volleys, and then bang, up the line?
how do you do that?
it was kind of a funny match today.  you're missing some of the easy shots.  then when you finally got the break, you hit a spectacular and difficult shot, the crosscourt pass that went off his racquet for 15-40.  but then one point earlier, you miss the volley that should have went in?
no luxilon?
before you do that, let's think about this tournament.  possibly robredo, possibly caas, and how would you match up with those two players?
caas' backhand looks much better than it was before the suspension, but still not his best shot.  can you attack it, come to the net?
how do you like your chances with this group of guys now?
some of the south american fans tend to be a little more vocal.  today they were a little like that.  is that something you notice?  does it affect your game at all?
two unrelated questions.  what do you do in your preparation for the off season, are there specific events in your mind that you're working towards?
yeah, like i want to do davis cup, i want to do well at this grand slam, or do you just try to take it month by month?
the women have announced they're going to madrid before the french.  how far away are the men from going to madrid, as well?
ivan, you can't just take caas' wins over federer and say there's a secret to be gained there because not everybody plays like he plays.  but is there something in those two matches that you see that helps you?
i mean, murray did it last year, for example; there's another retriever?
could you just take us through what happened?  was it the volley that you hit?
so what is it?
have you felt anything at all this week?
was that in the fourth game or the fifth game, do you know?
was it that volley that landed on the line or right close to the line?
so how do you feel emotionally?
(indiscernible.)
when did davis cup -- you get hurt, when did davis cup enter your mind?
it didn't look like you could play much longer at that level, but had you not had the davis cup in your mind, could you have played longer?
andy, when you came in and had the medical break, it looked like you had a spring in your step, like i could get through this.  were you optimistic or still pessimistic after the break?
it seemed like you came out like you were ready to go.
is it special for you to see caas beat federer two times?
yes, because you tried to beat him, and he arrived from nowhere and he beat him two times, is it strange for you?
what is your feeling?
it looked like when you first -- for the changeover you didn't immediately call for a trainer, or did you?
so when you went off court, did you get a massage from a trainer?
a match like that, what can you say about it?  i mean, you beat him just two weeks ago at the final at indian wells.  today what was the difference?
do you think your level was as good as the final of indian wells?
do you think your playing level, your standards was as high as when you played in the final of indian wells?
how does your foot feel?
what are your plans now?
you have dominated the play circuit in europe, you know, tremendously, and at this point going back for really like a third year of playing so well, is it -- what is left for you to do there?  is it your attitude that gee, i just have to do this again or is it brand-new all over?
the improvement that you made in your hard court game in the last few weeks, can you take it with you, even though you won't be playing on hard court for several months now?  can you pick up with this improved play where you left off in july?
he served a lot on your backhand tonight.  do you think it was the biggest problem for you?
this time last year you and roger were so dominant, winning all the masters series tournaments.  this year it's a little bit different.  do you feel the pressure from people like djokovic and murray and some of the others coming up?
when did you first realize there was something wrong with you?
what did he say to you at the net?
but you started a lot better today than you did yesterday, hitting the ball nice?
how much does it help having brad gilbert as a coach?
does it suit you, andy, having a lighter day?
playing again in the masters semifinals, at least you'll be going into this one with everything in good working order?
while you were out there, did it suit you, the stadium court, any better than grandstand?
what do you think you have to do to beat djokovic?
how impressed are you with nadal, playing on hard courts now?
what is the general feeling in the locker room with federer losing the second successful time in the masters series?  is there a general feeling that maybe his aura of invincibility is fading away a little bit?
how do you actually -- ho have you actually physically been to roehampton?
what do you think of it?  what do you think of how it's coming along the last time you saw it?
with this famous victory, the best victory of your career, there probably is dancing on the streets of belgrade as we speak (laughing)?
after what happened in indian wells, you were obviously very pumped up for this match.  what was your mindset coming into it?
some of those rallies near the end where he's just getting ridiculous shots back, can you just talk us through this, inside your mind throughout the process of that rally, are you getting more and more nervous thinking about the number and the point?
you played llodra, you played lopez, rafa was the second left-hander.  playing two left-handers before rafa, did that help you a little?
murray again?
it's a good contrast, you attack and he defends?
you said just there that the three of you are bringing something new to tennis?
you're bringing a lot of emotion, and the crowd interaction, if you like.  is that something that you personally want to bring, get the crowd more involved?
which is a better way to measure yourself now, is it against a federer, a nadal, or is it against the baghdadises, murrays of your generation?
which is for you a more important measuring stick, the federers and nadals or --
did you see yesterday the game when federer and caas?
looks like you've sold every ticket in your player's box.  who do you have there supporting you?
have you gotten nervous before the match with the national team playing football?
1-1?
is it fair to say that last year you had this opponent who beat you, is that in your mind or is it old or do you want to beat him more?
your first three opponents, you're going to get tougher opponents as you go deeper, but you play around the net in the first three matches, been pretty good.  what's your take on that?
78 percent conversions.
have you heard nadal is not going to play davis cup?
he's hurt but he's still playing here.  he's planning to be hurt in ten days, seriously.
correct.
patrick was saying that it's just kind of a shame.  that it would be nice for tennis to have all the top players, but he understands, also, that the scheduling is hard for some -- you know, it's hard.
are you disappointed both on a sort of a competitive level and a davis cup team level?
speaking of patience, andy murray next.  what have you learned about playing him?  you've had a few matches with him.
are you surprised by what serena has done at the australian open and what she did today to maria?
is she just that good that she can come back, and when she plays her best, can anybody beat her?
is it surprising that she's playing as well as she is as infrequently as she plays?  she has not played since the australian open.
they've talked about changing the -- they've kind of mandated this tournament change to best two of three for the men's final.  how do you feel about that?
how many really great five-set matches have you ever seen?
it's sort of rhetorical because you think of great matches you've seen, maybe agassi/sampras at the us open four sets.  but how many great five-set matches do you really remember?
i'm not saying there's not a lot, but compare the total number.  if you really want to play five sets every time, is it really worth going five sets every time you go out there, except in a grand slam?
it's getting into the final stretch here.  do you feel like you really need to take it up another level from here on out?
you haven't felt it really this week?
can you imagine a day where there are no best-of-five matches, even in grand slams?  it's sort of a slippery slope you start taking away best of five.
but history would --
you mentioned that murray in his way baits you.  do you think that maybe a couple of years ago you would have been easier bait than you are now?
you're more patient, there's more patience in you.
speaking of legs, as a fan, are you keeping an eye on guillermo caas, and if so, what are your thoughts there?
just his comeback and how quickly he's risen back into the top 50.
no, he was on suspension, of course.
quite a match, andy, quite a turnaround.
can you recall the last time -- apart from those first two games -- you started so sluggishly in a match?
how much more satisfying is it?  you get on court sometimes, you play great, everything is flowing, and you think, yeah, well great, but you scrap your way through.  you must feel that much more satisfied yourself that you kept going?
what do you do differently when you're in that situation now to what you did a year ago when you were in that kind of situation?
do you have in the back of your mind, andy, in those situations, a, you want to win for yourself, of course, but b, that his reputation as someone who finds it tough to close out matches?  is that something you think, well, he hasn't crossed the finish line first and i still think i can improve, but his record is of someone who has failed at the final hurdle a few times?
well, is that in the back of your mind, that you know he finds it difficult to close out matches?
how does it feel, quarterfinals, semifinals, final, apart from the australian open, reaching the fourth round, you've had a great run of results.  apart from the tiredness, as you say, feeling good about everything else?
did finding a way to win involve lots of small adjustments rather than anything significant, like the short stuff being a bit tighter and being a bit more accurate with some of your deeper shots?
does the escape give you a rush of adrenaline when you've saved the matchpoints and you get a sequence of games?
were you referring to yourself as an idiot (laughter)?
well, i wanted to find out from you if that was the case.
we've all done it.
did you get that from phil mickelson?
i'm such an idiot.  remember when he made the double bogey on 18?  that was original.
were you displeased?  you looked displeased most of the match.
the speed of the court, we've heard reports about that from everybody.  slow?  fast?  medium?
is it good for the game?
for you, i mean.
kei nishikori, could you tell me your impression about him?
was the wind about the same as it always is?  it's swirling, isn't it?
here, yes.
maybe this is insulting, but was that drop shot intentional?
can you talk about the match a little bit today?
does he usually come to the net?  were you expecting that?
why do you think that is?  did he change his game a little bit today?
do you think maybe you should have been more aggressive?
the other thing is about the lucky loser.  the whole thing, the whole experience, is this the farthest you've ever come as a lucky loser?
but this was the best you've done?
you would have been in mexico, right, mexico city?
how will this benefit you, this instead of mexico?
also, money-wise, even the third round, is it better than it would have been in mexico?
how gratifying was this?
when you woke up this morning did you visualize this?
did you do that?
what's the worst possible scenario that you visualized last night?
you had a really good victory against acasuso in the previous round.  that must have given you a lot of confidence coming into this match.
there are so few guys in this country who have chosen to go to college, have talked about how they feel like they started the tour behind the 8 ball and haven't gotten enough support from the federation and/or that in the end it kind of retarded their growth.  do you regret your decision at all?  and have you gotten enough support from the usta since you turned pro?
again, just the years in college, do you feel like you would be further ahead had you not gone to college?
how often do you go back to bosnia?
how do you get back in touch of your roots when you go back there?
how old were you when you came here?
you lived in jacksonville?
and your parents?
where did you go to high school?
what is the actual difference tennis-wise between college and here?
what accounts for the run you're on now?  what's happening that hasn't happened before?
as far as your family background, was your family forced to leave bosnia because of the war?
was your family affected by the situation?
could you talk about how that background affected you as an athlete?  is it overstating the case to say that you're a more competitive person because of what you've been through?
when did you learn to play?
what are your parents' names, if you can spell them?  what did they do for a living where you lived?  what do they do now?
the cousin that was sent, was that by some kind of a refuge organization?
you spoke english when you came over?
do you still travel with your sketch pad and pencils?
between the time you turned pro and now, did you have very many moments where you thought, what am i doing?  i'm just too far behind.  i need to maybe pursue another line.
what are you thinking now, top 50, more than that?
do you know who you play next?
have you played them?
i mean, after this victory, does it give you more hope?  i mean, how far do you think you can go?
you became an american citizen?  you are an american citizen?
when did you become an american citizen?
and your parents, are they american citizens?
what year did you graduate high school, by the way?
how'd it go today?
what was lacking today?
is that a good sign of the way you're playing now?
how much is davis cup in the back of your mind, or do you allow yourself to think about that at all?
what do you think is going on with james?
have you spoken to him?
how much does that weigh on your head, like when you're going into a davis cup?  because you've been in a similar situation where you're not playing that well.  you don't want to let the team down.  is that something that he's going to start to think about and it's going to build up?
what is your best guesstimate for the no.2 player?
little tune-up then?
you mentioned at indian wells that you have a little bit different surface than what you played out there.  can you kind of describe what would be ideal for the american team?
andy, do you agree that murray and djokovic are separating themselves from the other talented 21 and unders?  what would you say is separating those two right now?
what have you been told, if anything, about your role with the davis cup match against the u.s.?
what have you been told by emilio, if anything?
is it a difficult decision, you think?
this could be four top 10 players in this davis cup.  could be.  could be a fantastic davis cup.  how badly do you want to be part of that?
the two countries have had some good davis cup ties in the last two years.  is there a real rivalry building up in davis cup between these two countries?
rivalries don't have to be negative.  they can be something people look forward to, because the two countries have played each other before, and there's always an exciting competition?
are you expecting to find out tomorrow, or would he take both of you to winston-salem and decide later?
yeah.
are you surprised they chose winston-salem and an indoor hard court?
since the players' meeting last tuesday night, have you had a chance to sit down with etienne and try to talk things out a little bit more than things got talked out last tuesday?
how badly would you like to sit down with him one-on-one?
how do you think it will resolve itself?
while he's proposing changes in europe, there are no changes proposed for the u.s.  is there some resentment building up among european players toward not the american players, but toward the united states in general?
was it good?
do you feel good physically?
they used to say john mcenroe had the rage for perfection.  you seem to have a bit of that.  not that you berate linemen or anything, but you seem that you hate to lose any points.  is that kind of your mentality?
does that help you play better when you constantly get on yourself and berate yourself?
what would you say?
are you ready for a breakthrough?  do you feel that you're on the cusp of a breakthrough?  top 10, that type, beating the top players?
anything separating you and novak from some of the other young guys right now?
does it feel like you have also a fewer highs and lows maybe than some of the other guys you're often lumped together with?
fewer.
fewer ups and downs, a little more consistent?
what do you feel you need to get to the next level?  you seem like you have all the shots.  maybe is it fitness or anything like that?  something to improve on?  anything to improve on?
you see jp doing his rescue act?
if it is gonzalez you meet next, do you expect that to be very different to the us open?
he's got a new coach and all the rest of it.
you haven't seen anything different in his game since you last played him?
do you feel you've completely gotten over the physical problems of last week now?
not to overdo this, but can you give me an example of what you say to yourself when you're a little annoyed with yourself?
you chose not to retire in your match with haas in the last tournament.  but are you aware of players that sort of tend to retire more in matches if they're losing and these kinds of things, or as a player?
but isn't it sort of sometimes a player that is maybe a little bit hurt and they're starting to lose, they don't want to give the other guy the satisfaction of having to win, so they sort of pack it in?
are you aware of that, of players that do that on the tour?
what is the best thing or the no.1 thing that brad gilbert has been able to convey to you that you feel has worked?
you ever read his book?
as you said, you played quite conservatively today, but you attacked a lot at times.  does it also help you having played two very different ways, to have settled into a tournament and play differently like that?
this is maybe the place to start that run of victories.  hasn't been your greatest year so far.
what do you think the difficulty has been so far?
what did you think of the atmosphere out there today?
describe it for people who maybe weren't sitting out there.  what's it like?
you like when they hold the flags up and they yell all that stuff?
do you think that the argentines and the latin america fans are a little more boisterous and get more into it?  why is that?
than maybe just the americans.
why do you think that is?
they sing the national anthem during the rain delay?
do you think that's good for tennis?
i think it looked as if maybe vince was getting frustrated.
spadea.
we did.  he was looking -- he threw the ball at the people.  he kept looking at those people.
david, you next play jarkko nieminen, who you played many times before.  very fast player.  could you talk to us a bit about the challenge of playing him.
you know he won today?
korolev, rather amazingly.  does that concern you at all?
do you remember your last win over a top 10 player?
did you change your game after the last time you played james?
was it difficult to finish?  here you've got a matchpoint, he serves an ace, then you have to sit down for ten minutes.
you mentioned james' backhand.  did you sense he was struggling a little bit hitting aggressive shots with it?
yes.
when the tiebreak gets very close to the end, is it difficult to play your game without being too careful?
when it's set point against you in a tiebreak, what is your mentality?
indian wells, the air is very thin and the ball seems to fly a great deal.  here do you find that the ball stays in the court more easily?
the players' meeting tuesday was not very simpatico.  since then, in the last three days, have you had a chance to talk with etienne?  are things going to be better?
do you want to meet with him to try to smooth things out?
will it distract you in your tennis if you try to meet with him during the tournament?
what happened?  you were supposed to be in the stadium and then they kicked you out.
you might possibly be on the stadium court in your next match.
you've played four top 10 players already this year and now you're about to play probably the no.1 player in the world.  do these matches at your stage, do they advance the plot?  are you happy to play these guys, or would you rather wait until you're a little bit more ready?
he's in a slump.
what does it feel like to go up against him?
is there any other kind of preparation that you try to do, maybe in practice?
you're taller than him.
will there actually be less pressure on you because you'll sort of feel like, oh, i've got nothing to lose?
do you think you would tighten up if you won the first set?
it would be a nice problem to have.
what about the additional pressure of having tiger woods sitting there?
yeah, he's going to be there saturday.
who's going to be in yours?
what's your weapon?  is it your serve?
average speed is about 130?
do you pattern your game after anybody?
(indiscernible).
as the match progressed were there things you were particularly focusing on that are trends and weaknesses?
roger talked after his match about taking time away from other players.  is that how it felt to play him today?  could you explain to be on the receiving end of that, how exactly does it work?
is that the best he's ever played against you?
you played the top three players in the tournament.  can you describe the gap between roger federer and the others?  some people argue the gap is getting smaller.
is it still fun when you're playing federer?
in the middle of the year it seems that maybe roger federer can be challenged by the young players.  do you see one player who can reach his level?  if so, who?
you returned very well, but today you had some problems with the serve of federer.  can you tell us why it's so difficult to return?
how do you feel after the fantastic week?  you were the best performing player of this week, better than players with higher ranking than you.  how do you feel about that?
you like to work a lot.  how many days of holiday will you take?
you've spoken generously about rafa and djokovic.  to have seen your performance this week, a good year overall for you, should one expect you to be on their level next year?  is such modesty required at this point?
we know in this tournament you actually had some contact with the chinese masseurs.  does it have something to do with the chinese masseurs?  do you think you will have some cooperation with them down the line?
comparing your previous three titles from the masters cup, how emotional is this fourth title for you?
everyone seems to be worried about your tennis crisis.  seven games you lost in the final last year.  seven games you lose this time in the final.  how do you react to all this?  three slams won this year, another one lost in a final.  it's a disaster.
not to be nosy, but what do you do with these 53 titles you have?  do you have a room someplace or shelves?
this was a fantastic week for david.  do you think it might be a boost for his next season, and that you will see him in the finals of slams and masters series, or was it a once in a lifetime opportunity?
is there a sense now that you've sort of begun to transcend the sport, become bigger maybe than tennis itself, like maybe tiger woods in golf, michael jordan in basketball, even david beckham in a different sort of way?  does it become more difficult to keep your focus solely on the tennis?
in china one of the oldest customs is the circus.  i think next year, 2008, with the olympic games, more difficult for you.  you want also the olympic gold, or how do you see it?
seems pretty certain from here on out you're going to be increasingly playing against history, compared to the greats of the past.  you talked about players whose games you liked a lot as you were coming up.  you mentioned rios, edberg, becker.  if you think of all the greats of the past in terms of who had the greatest game, regardless of the number of grand slams they won, what sort of appraisal do you make?
you always seem extremely good when you're playing finals in the masters cup, apart from the 2005 loss to nalbandian.  why is it?  because you're simply too good in the final?
last month in paris and madrid you lost to nalbandian twice.  this time you lost to gonzlez.  would you say the three losses will motivate you to do even better?
you lose your first match of the tournament, then win four in a row.  yesterday you're down 15-30 to nadal, go on a big streak.  today you're down 30-40, go on a big streak.  is there something about adversity that brings out the best in your game?
you're going to play an exhibition with pete sampras next week.  can you talk about that.  do you expect to play pete sampras as professionals on the tour or something like that?
tossing aside the rankings, but how they've played against you, who do you think is the best player you've played so far in your career, and why?
today the last point, it was you passing ferrer in the net.  you also demonstrated it's possible to go to the net.  your game is going all around better and better.  do you think you can improve?
if you were a coach, you have to say to a player, you're going to play roger federer.  you have to do this, that and that.  what would you say?
do you feel disappointed about your match?  the fans feel disappointed.  any words for them?  are you planning to go to the beijing olympics?
after you were broken in the sixth game of the second set, you got three breakpoints.  you still lost it.  do you think that would be the key moment of the whole match?  how do you feel about that?
given the way you turned around 2006 with jimmy in your corner, you probably had some pretty big hopes for this year.  it's not over yet.  but everyone thinks of jimmy as a great player, but how would you evaluate him as a coach and do you plan on continuing your partnership?
noting your short turnaround, the fact it was a little cool out there, you had a massage, did you have a little trouble getting warmed up?
moving on to the davis cup, you've had four matches under your belt here.  assuming you can get the back sorted out, how do you look forward to that?  as the season for a whole for davis cup, can you tell us maybe how important patrick mcenroe has been as a coach and your thoughts on him?
yes.
patrick.
how much of a difference do you notice in ferrer, if any, the last two times you've played him compared to the previous two times?
how much of your work with jimmy involves tactical stuff?  in light of your poorer results this year, the tournaments you would describe yourself as frustrating results, do you have any sort of tactical rethinking to do for next year?
about ferrer, what is his technical ability?  everyone sees that he runs a lot, that he gets everywhere.  what really gives you troubles?  the fact you have to make the point five times or something else?  does he have also some kind of spin or something that bothers you?
or angles.
related to his speed, you kept coming into the net even though you were getting passed.  was that because you felt that was the only way you could beat him?  you said it's a game of constant adjustments.
you play against both david and roger this week.  based on their performances this week, what do you think is going to happen if they meet in the final?
i think the way you are playing is so great that these indoor courts, it's very difficult.  paris was quicker.  here is slower.  it's becoming really important because perhaps in faster indoor courts you could beat ferrer.  this time his answer of the serve was great.  do you think that's the evolution of the game?  it's very easy to say, hey, come to the net, but they pass you.  henman is not here any more.
what is your schedule now going to be leading up to davis cup?
olympic medal, grand slam champion, which do you prefer?
the first set up until 4-4 looked very tight.
tight.  one could argue that you played a cleaner first few games than roger, and then he broke you and sort of ran away with things.
you looked good on the service at the beginning of the first set.  how important is it not to let him get ahead of you?  is that the key to everything in a match against roger?
roger and david will meet in the final.  david is one of the best performing players in this tournament.  roger beat you tonight within one hour.  what do you think is going to happen in the final?
five sets.
do you think he won this game tonight because he served in such an amazing way tonight?  do you want to do some work to improve your return?
are you going to approach next season differently at all, play fewer tournaments or train in a different way, to make sure you maintain your health?
at one point roger won 20 of 21 points from 4-4 in the first set.
he won 20 of 21.  he won a lot of points in a row.
something like that.
how frustrating was that period of the match?  is that the best roger has played against you?
with the win tonight, roger is now having a better record against you in 2007 with three wins and two losses.  on clay court, he is having more chances to play against you than a couple years ago.  do you think now you may lose advantage to play him mentally and technically?
you've made it to the finals.  do you think you can draw some lessons out of this game today?  tomorrow, no matter whichever one you play against, what is your probability of winning the trophy?
gasquet said after your match you are the favorite of the tournament and you can win this.  now that you're in the final, do you believe it is true?
everybody thinks you are very fit on the court.  can you tell us exactly how much you train during the season, before this masters cup as well?
you defeated novak djokovic and rafael nadal.  do you think you still have the potential to be higher in the rankings in the future?
couldn't be nearly as easy as you made it look tonight.  do you want to tell us about it?
this is the fifth matchup against rafa this year.  what does this matchup mean to you?  is it proving no.1 or anything?
is it proving no.1?
in the first set, you were behind love-40 and hit a lot of aces.  how could you manage to do that?
some people were suggesting after you lost your first-round match and after you'd lost in paris that maybe you were starting to slip a little bit.  did that motivate you at all?  because you've been so dominant the last three matches.
another question about your service game.  how big an improvement do you think you made in your serve compared to three or four years ago?  do you think you rely on your serve much more than before?
watching last night's match against andy, one was tempted to conclude he really lacks the tools and variety to challenge you, at least at the moment.  if you compare tonight's match with yesterday's match, it's a similar pattern.  when you're playing like this, are there any answers to your game you see on the horizon in the men's game?  is there any difference between the challenge you felt in the course of the match between tonight and last night?
now you're facing david ferrer, who is the best performing player in this tournament.  your record against him is 7-0.  do you think you're going to beat him quickly like this match, within one hour?
you talk about it's important to analyze when you have the setbacks.  can you be pragmatic about it?  us mere mortals, if we have a bad day at work, we go home, worry about it, maybe toss and turn, sleep is a bit difficult.  can you put it out of your mind after you've analyzed it?
you're now playing david ferrer.  the head-to-head with him is really in your favor.  which parts of your game make it so difficult for him to play against you?
do you think you are careful enough tonight?  this is my first question?  the second is, what is wrong with your serve?  here is 60% first serve.  i think maybe there is some problems.
do you think you are careful enough tonight?
yes.
the day before yesterday you said when you faced roger again you will be careful in the match.
i haven't heard you talk this week about your foundation.  would you like to talk a little bit about what that means to you, highlights from this year, and plans for next year.
obviously frustrating out there when he's playing that well.  can you give us an idea what's going through your head when you realize he's really on top of his game?
tomorrow you play david ferrer.  he's the surprise of the tournament.  you know him even this year, so what is your opinion for tomorrow?
you had the best record going into this match in the tournament.  i want to get a sense from you how much air this takes out of your balloon?  you don't play roger again tomorrow, but does it affect your own sense of things going into tomorrow's match?
obviously the frustration is very understandable.  like you say, he's always on top of his game, which is annoying.  when you're getting upset, breaking the racquets, it's natural.  does there come a point during the match where you think, the guy on the other side of the net, i'm not going to be able to get it done tonight?
you were the last one to defeat roger federer as an american player.  with 40 losses in four years, do you think it was very difficult for american tennis to conquer the swiss who are dominating the tennis world right now?
roger federer.
did it make a big difference that roger didn't have to win tonight?
will you still be confident when you meet roger again maybe in the final?  if the answer is yes, where does the confidence come from?
you mentioned a second ago this being sort of more a matchup problem.  when that's the case against a player, what do you do?  what's the next step to approaching how to solve that?
any thoughts at all, considering how you must feel right now, about not coming in and facing us?  must be not exactly the most fun thing you have to do.
having seen many of your matchups with roger, i'm tempted to say you really have to serve your absolute best to have a chance against him.  also perhaps would you say you need to do a lot better moving forward, covering the net against him?
i'm talking about being a more natural net player.
that's what you're going to have to wake up and figure it out.  you said you have to figure it out.
the younger generation appears to be rising rapidly.  seems like in this masters cup they're not performing very well, like richard or novak.  have you got something to say to them?  are they still too young and inexperienced?
watching the match tonight, having seen the other matches, the results of the last few months, should andy roddick be considered a sort of top-tier threat to you in terms of the way your games match up?
now you play nadal.  the same semi as last year.  do you think it's better to play him in the semis three sets, five sets?  what are your expectations for tomorrow?
rafa said something in madrid a couple weeks ago about he (cried?) a little bit after the wimbledon final because he lost to you in the wimbledon final.  it was a very important match for him to challenge you in the no.1 ranking, but he failed.  do you know about that?  if not, what do you say about now?
i know you're not looking ahead to australia, but i wanted to ask you about the new surface.  are you going to miss rebound ace?  the new one they're putting down is like the one that was in greece at the olympics.
at one point, if we heard him right, andy said something to you like, don't worry, i'll get better.  obviously you want to win, but he was not on top of his game.  can you even feel a little for him in that kind of situation or you're just worried about winning?
rafa said today that if you play at the top of your game it will be impossible for him to beat you.  do you think he's trying to put all the pressure on you, or the surface here really makes you the favorite for this match, even like he is the clay court specialist?
you face the real prospect in the next year or so to break the record of total number of grand slam victories.  soon you're supposed to play in an exhibition against pete sampras.  do you ever imagine in your mind what it would be like to match up against greats of the past in a fantasy match where you're both playing at your prime?  if so, do you have any sense of who would give you the best match or who would be the toughest to beat, sampras, laver, borg, whoever?  secondly, i notice you miss a lot of line calls.  you challenge the line calls.  we found something you don't do very well.  you challenge them.  you seem to always get it wrong.  have you noticed that?
do you come to a point sometimes where you feel sorry for andy, so many times in a row facing you?  i guess you've heard andy murray was separated from brad gilbert.  there's already a lot of speculation saying that you might consider.  could you talk a little bit about that?
you said you were impressed with your own performance.  what were you impressed most about it?
what part of his game made it that you could not play your game?
the other day the fans gave you some presents.  how do you feel about that?  it's your first trip to play in shanghai, in china as well.  how do you feel about the atmosphere here?
will you play in beijing, like china open or the beijing olympic games next year?
the french designer of the terra cotta said they made yours in one day because you were the last one.  do you feel satisfied about your terra cotta statue?  how do you evaluate your whole masters cup experience?
there's some talk in new zealand that you may be considering playing a warmup tournament to the australian open open there in auckland.  is this true?  would you consider such a tournament?
now your matches are finished.  do you still have any plan to go around the city maybe with your uncle or your girlfriend?
who is the girl watching your match with your uncle?
we have three newcomers in this group.  you, david and novak.  how to you evaluate the performance of the other two?
what about yourself?  evaluate your own performance.
we know you are going to have a rematch with rafael nadal next week in malaysia.  how do you think about this match?
has it gotten to the point where you expect to come out and play this well or does it still surprise you at all?
before the match, did you ever think you would have to fight for nadal?  after your three consecutive wins, have you ever considered you would be the champion?
with three wins, not having huge amounts of money in your pockets, like $450,000, much more than you earned in the us open as a semifinalist.  so i'm sure this is the most prize money you have earned in such a huge event.  how do you plan to deal with such huge money?
when the draw was out, you were not the favorite for the fans or the media to pick to qualify for the semifinal.  what do you say about that?
gasquet was saying in the press conference that if you asked him what his game plan would be to play nadal or federer, he could tell.  he said playing against you, he doesn't know what to do to beat you.  i'm curious, how do you approach the game?  do you have a preference for somebody to play in the semis or do you just play your game?
you have played a lot of matches this season, but you are still very physically strong at the end of the year.  are you going to plan to play a similar number of tournaments next season?
you have three victories now, even better than federer.  how do you feel about that?
obviously you had a great year.  probably a little bit disappointing for you, the outcome here at the tournament.  can you talk about that a little bit?
you came with a string in miami winning.  after, you beat roddick, rafa and federer.  i think you have opened let's say a new way for the next year.
are you going to have some rest?  it's nearly christmas.  where are you going to spend the holidays?
your perception of the match today, do you feel this was your best performance here this week?
speaking about resting, are you planning on working on any new impersonations during the off-season?
what is the best memory of this year for you?  what has been the worst memory of this year for you?  what is your dream for next year?
yes.
the record for you to play against roger federer and rafael nadal is not so good in 2007.  two losses with each in grand slams.  only one win with roger and two wins with rafael.  do you think with your confidence rising up you may have better preparation for to play against the best two players in the world next year?
this is your first time to shanghai.  give us some general comments about your first impressions of this city.
the other day rafa admitted that he felt tired playing against ferrer.  today did you find he was playing on the same physical level he usually does or he was moving well?
we all know rafael nadal is also 21, the same as you.
do you feel he always appears to be more mature than those who are also 20?  what do you think is his secret of being so good at the grand slam and all the big occasions?
not an easy question to answer, but you may try.  about the betting situation.
let's say someone approaches you and asks you to lose a match.  of course you would say not, i guess.  but what do you think you should do at that moment?  go and say to someone that someone approached you?  would you be afraid to do that because maybe he's a criminal and he could do some damage to you, to your family?  that is the question.
nobody knows what to do when you get yourself in that situation.  that's why i ask you.  everyone says you should announce it, but then nobody knows what to do.  would you know it?  the rule is to call an 800 number or to say to the atp or to talk to a policeman.  but actually, is it a case of cautions?  this is the question.  i'm sorry, but it's difficult.  i don't know how to answer myself, to be honest.
seven unforced errors.  you have to be pretty happy with that, especially after the layoff.
with the importance you put on davis cup this year, making the final, has that relieved some pressure at this tournament?  are you more relaxed than you were last year?
as much as obviously you would think the match is about how well you play, with the nature of fernando's game, do you hope he's having a night like he had tonight rather than the one he had against roger?
you look down the other side of the court and you don't know exactly what he's going to do.
as you're already through to the semifinals, is it a special opportunity to cut the streak against roger to play totally freely?
round robin has worked out for you nicely here.  you're the first guy through.  can you refresh our memories on what your take was on it was when they thought about introducing it for tournaments at the start of the year?
you weren't surprised when they ditched it?
a lot of players have their own signature sort of post-match bow.  agassi used to go to all four sides.  i noticed since you've been here, you're doing something.  do you want to talk about what inspired you to adopt that?
who do you want to meet in the semifinals?  who is the likely candidate you will meet in the semifinals?
you said after your first match you expected to talk to jimmy on the phone.  did that conversation take place and did you talk tactics or did you just shoot the breeze together?
you've talked about how the break allowed you to work on your legs and your volleys and some other things.  considering how everyone else here is talking about how exhausted they are, do you think in a way the break has really helped you at this time of year?
you talked about the next match being very important to you.  how do you plan the next match between you and roger?
yes.
during the match we heard some roger song or the cow bell.  how do you comment with the fans reacting during the match, shouting for you?
the next one will be gonzlez and andy roddick.  would you give us your prediction?  whom do you wish to win in this game?
yes.
by your own standards maybe the first set, you started a little slowly.  were there still some nerves left over after lose your opener?
today maybe it's easier to ask you this question than the other day when you had lost.  but what is your feeling about the fact that the top four players all lost one match in the first three days of this masters?  this doesn't happen often.  i don't think it's ever happened before.  is there a reason?  why this year and not in the previous year?  more stress?  more fatigue?
this means that the balance, there has never been such a balance like this year in the tennis world?
you had 39 unforced errors.  you wasted most of your breakpoints in the second set.  you failed at every challenge.  1 to 10, how do you rate this match?
you celebrated your year-end no.1 ranking last night.  what does it mean to keep no.1 ranking for consecutive years?
one of the things that people used to say about pete sampras is that even when he wasn't playing his best on a particular day, he'd always raise his game at the big moments.  we saw you do that today.  what do you tell yourself in order to play your best when it matters the most, or is it just beyond words?
you talked about previous generations, not wanting to make the comparison.  would you say in the course of your career that the last six months have shown more depth of competition at the very top of the game than at other times in your career or there's a beginning of a suggestion of more competition at the top of the game given the breakthrough of djokovic and nalbandian's recent performance, and i could mention a couple of others as well?
davydenko kind of joking said that the reason why you had more trouble this season than any other was that you were older and you were more tired.  what do you think about that?
it's impossible for you to beat federer or your mind is also in the davis cup final or how is the situation?
you seem to always have a way to deal with taller, stronger guys on the atp.  after the loss to roger, have you learned something to deal with him, fight with him?
after the 11th loss to roger, have you got some more ways to fight with him?
rather than talking about what it's like to lose to roger for the 11th time, did you talk about what you see the difference between him and you when you're playing each other tight like that?  what are the critical differences that you can point to?
one could look at the second half of this season and make the argument that things are tightening up at the top of the men's game.  is your impression the game is becoming more competitive at the very top?
are you at the point where you can't wait till this season is over?  maybe you have a nice vacation planned or something.  are you thinking, there's still davis cup left, but you'd like it to be all over and already 2008?
you broke him twice today in very important moments.  did you see him doubting more than usually compared to the games you played with him before?  how would you say your serve was today?
the atp has withdrawn the punishment towards you for the $2,000 fine.  any comment on that?
do you think what happened outside the court has an influence on your game, those match-fixing talks makes it difficult to concentrate on your game here?
as you're playing the davis cup final for russia, will you have any holidays?  australia, it's a long calendar.
one more question on the $2,000 fine.  first they punish you, then they give you the fine.  second, they say you're not fined anymore.  did you expect they were asking you or telling you, sorry, we made a mistake, excuse us?
directly on roger, he's lost more matches this year than he has in the last couple, and to more players.  people are talking maybe he's a little more vulnerable now.
should we be thinking he's easier to beat now or should we not be thinking that?
have you watched many of the other matches here?  if so, other than speaking about federer, can you give us your sense of the rest of the field, who has really impressed you?
you're one of the best returners on the tour.  since you played andy roddick and federer in three days, can you compare these two guys' serve?  what is the feeling to return their serve?  which one is more difficult to handle?
the second game of the second set was 11 minutes long.  you held.  what does a game like that take out of you?
you gave up challenging towards the end.  does that mean you gave up on this match towards the end?  you didn't challenge the last call on the line.  does that mean you gave up the match?
it seems the first four seeds didn't do well in the last few days.  both federer and davydenko lost.  you lost today.  djokovic has been eliminated already.  how do you feel about that?  are you unlucky or are the people like you a target?
can you say something about david's play today.  he played incredible tennis.  pretty much nothing you could do in the third set.
towards the end of the match you looked pretty tired.  did you feel tired or did you have any physical problem today?
you two were very similar in terms of the way you were playing with fast footwork and topspin and running, strong defense.  did you ever think that you were actually competing against yourself on court?
he plays the same as you, very quick.
what is it like playing against somebody who you're friends with off the court and who knows your game and you know their game so well?
you played great today.  ferrer made you play some really tough defense.  there are times, as well as he was playing, you were able to take charge of the point and play offensively.  what was the difference between when you were forced to play defensively and when you could play offensively?
when you are 1-4 behind you, do you think you have confidence to catch up?
it seems that you play in the similar way like you play on clay.  now you are on hard court.  do you have the plan to try to play more aggressively on hard court?
with one win, you're in a good position.  the final match against rafael nadal will be a key match for you to qualify for the semifinals.  how do you feel about the rematch with nadal?
what do you think of your opponent for today's match?
your opponent, yes.
you took the first set in your first round robin match.  you took the first set this time.  you had the advantage and lost to nadal.  tonight you stepped it up.  any lingering doubt in your mind tonight about today's game?
you have been to many cities to play.  what do you think of today's audience?
we noticed that after you served, you would keep on hitting that ball.  is it superstitious?
you are a young age.  these days players at your age, like rafael nadal, they overwhelm you.  from this you have more pressure or more motivation?
in the first set, a ball got broken and then you lost two games.  did the ball interrupt you?
yesterday your fans brought two t-shirts for you in the hilton.  are you surprised there are a lot of fans for you in china?
those two t-shirts, which one is your preferred one?
yannick noah has helped you out a lot with your game and your application to the game.  can you tell us when was the last time you spent time with him and what things he's taught you?
when did you last spend time with him?
it's the first time you qualified to play the masters cup.  do you expect to defeat the no.2 and no.3 player in the world in a row?
before the match when i interviewed you, i asked in which respect you outplayed nadal.  you said you play playstation better than nadal.  can you tell us more, any other aspects that you are better than nadal?
do you think it helps you that people talk about roger federer here, people talk about rafael nadal, and people don't really talk too much about david ferrer?  do you think this is good that people kind of ignore for you?
it's the end of the season.  some players complain they are pretty tired.  how do you keep physically so fresh in the end of the season?
when nadal caught up in the last round of the game, how did you feel?
you like red and black.  which color do you prefer?
the next match will be against richard gasquet.  you beat him easily last time.  do you feel your game suits his game very well, or he played very badly that day or he played very well?
you have been recently quoted saying that once you were the worst top hundred in the world.  then the spanish journalists told me you were the worst top 10 in history.  do you start to believe you may be a very good player now?
this is the first loss at a round robin masters cup.  is it a normal loss or extra loss for anything?
what happened during the second set in the tiebreak?  7-0 is definitely not your style.
the crowd usually goes for the underdog.  i'm wondering if that was at all a factor, if that affected your play at all, because they were definitely pro gonzlez today.
it seems there were some problems with your backhand.  would you give us some comments on it.
obviously people always praise you, praise the shot-making that you have.  do you sometimes stand on the other side from fernando and think, how on earth did he make that shot?
do you think the 10 defeats over him is actually a pressure to them or a pressure to you, yourself?
you say the australian open final.  was your game plan the same for this match, or did you modify at all?
was there some issue with the challenges after the second set?  you seemed pretty unhappy with something.  or was that the frustration at the way the tiebreak went?
do you have any physical problems with the third set?
so you didn't have any physical problem?
last week we saw you in the coffee promotion and the gillette promotion shaving.  do you sometimes worry about your sponsorship commitments making you lose concentration about tournaments?  how do you keep them balanced?
it seems this year the other guy had to speak spanish.  you lost two times to caas, two to nalbandian, two to nadal, and now the last one gonzlez.  maybe the players must learn spanish to beat you.
it's a joke.
i come from argentina.  no argentinian players.  let me make you a joke.
people away from the situation might say that this is the time when maybe he could do with a coach.  you're playing without a coach.  assessing something like this on the back of the nalbandian ones, what would be your argument to that?
since you became no.1 you've never lost to so many different players.  what's the meaning of that?  the competition is getting harder?
do you take game as the rehearsal of the davis cup final?
you did pretty well today, but you lost unfortunately.  this is the fifth time you lost to andy roddick.  do you think there are certain techniques he has that really pressure you quite a bit or suppress you?
you seemed to have some frustration after winning the second set.  he threw his racquet.  did you feel at that point you were going to have a lot of momentum?  then he kind of ran away with the third set.
you challenged the last point.  did you really think it was out?
did you have some trouble with your serve?  sometimes you served very slowly.  was it a problem, like in bercy, for example?
some months ago you were not happy because not many people were paying attention to you.  you were put on peripheral courts, never on center court in a slam.  now in the last matches you became more and more famous, but maybe you don't like it.  what was better?  was it better before when nobody was talking about you, or is it better now that everybody's talking about you?
think about it.
you don't have the sponsorship for a long time.  from the start of the year you got one.  all the news about you coming out, is your sponsorship happy or unhappy because you got a lot of publicity?
in the eighth game of the second set, you actually broke andy.  when you answered other questions, you mentioned in the first set you didn't seek a lot of chances because you actually didn't run too fast and you were a bit tired.  in the second set you took the upper hand and broke him.  what was the problem later on in the third set?
you had kind of a slow start today.  can you talk about how you got into the match and what you were thinking at the beginning?
you did a really good job this time, but at the same time i noticed that your opponent also did a good job and won the first set.  could you make some comments on those young players, about the same age as you, coming up this year like novak and richard?
i noticed that your knees are still taped up.  could you give us an idea how you're doing physically and how you felt out there?
for quite a good stretch it seemed like you and roger had a considerable distance on the next tier at the top of men's tennis.  we've seen novak come up a lot this year.  also nalbandian played extraordinary the last few weeks.  do you think there's an arrival where there's more of a crowd of players at the top?
what is your comment on the terra cotta warrior statue?  how do you like it?  will you take it home with you?
in today's match, which aspect do you think you outplayed richard gasquet?
just a little bit about novak, since you kind of had a big year like that once in your career.  how hard is it going to be for him to keep up that momentum in the second year after having such fantastic results?  how hard do you think it will be, from your experiences, when you had that similar situation?
as you just said, you're playing some serve and volley this year.  obviously you pushed roger very hard in the wimbledon final.  how confident are you that you can close the gap or do you feel you're closing the gap on roger at the top?
novak said you guys hang out with each other after he defeated roger federer in montral.  what about now in shanghai?  you are now in the same group.  you are now opponents.  after the match or before the match, do you have plans to hang out with novak in shanghai?
it's your third time to come to shanghai for the tennis masters cup.  what is your impression about the fans here in china?
you looked to be possibly on your way to a victory there till the middle of the second set.  can you give us an idea of what happened there?
there are three players in your group who for the first time come to shanghai.  novak has aims for the championship.  david has had good performances recently.  what's your expectations for your first tennis masters cup in shanghai?
you really seemed to understand the geometry of his game in the first set in particular.  when he was pulling you wide on the forehand side you won several points with really formidable forehands that kind of caught him wrong-footed.  was this a deliberate strategy that you had anticipated using or something that just happened?
nadal has more fans here in china.  during the match you got a huge support.  your support overwhelmed nadal.  did you expect this?
you are the first one in five years to qualify in the masters cup for france.  we can say that the situation right now in france is not good, especially for the men's tennis.  how do you feel about that?
how did you feel walking in the stadium with all the smoke in the air and the lights out?
what do you think about the punishment for betting, nine months without playing?  do you think that's fair for the players?
how do you feel about the player entrance ceremonies, just like the nba.  how do you like that?
today your quickness on the court was incredible.  do you think that wore novak down?  he looked tired early in the match.
you won in tokyo.  your late-season form is very good.  what do you think is the key to your form over the last part of the season?
today belongs to spanish players.  i noticed robredo is watching nadal's game and nadal then watched your game.  how close of friends are you?
today you and rafa nadal won matches.  you two had six encounters in the past.  did you gain something out of it?  did you learn some lessons to beat him next time?
for the last couple of years, roger and rafael have been a good distance ahead of the next group of players.  do you see the distance tightening up in the next year?  do you think the very top of the game is becoming more competitive right now?
why did you make so many unforced errors today?
i imagine this format is something a little unique for you.  i don't know how often you've played round robin.  how interesting or difficult do you think it's going to be coming back after the loss?
you said in bercy a week or so ago that you were feeling very, very tired and exhausted.  has the week's rest and the journey out here affected that at all?
you are smart and seem to be a careful boy.  i think no pains, no gains.  today you lose again.  i want to know how did you deal with such a stress?
did you watch any of the first match?  what is your opinion of your next match against richard gasquet?
in the second set, latter part of the second set, everybody was rooting for you.  did you feel this motivation?  which is bigger:  pressure or motivation?
how difficult is it to play against ferrer because he returns everything?
can you comment on the case of alessio di mauro?
do you think the punishment is too long?
you are the first player to practice on the center court.  after that you said the court is pretty slow for your style.  do you think it was still a problem for you today?
you did have a chance to break david in the first game of the second set.  in the last game of the match, you still got a breakpoint.  what happened in that key moment?
if nadal would invite you to go out, would you go with him?
has jimmy responded to your on-court suggestion?
tough to get on top of, wasn't he?
do you think he'll do a bit of damage at wimbledon?
do you have some sympathy that he has to head off to roehampton for the qualifying after this week?
can you remember the last time you hit two volleys on a match point down?
bit of a rarity.
can you remember what your emotions were like in your first atp final?
how does this compare to your other three here?
which do you think was your best performance over the week?
do you think you can perhaps learn a little bit more through tough matches, through a bit of adversity, rather than just blowing people away, getting used to the grass again?
having won the title again, how will you keep that intensity going?  how do you do it?
any particular things that jimmy has you focusing on at this particular time?
anybody in particular you're looking to see in london?
who?
an english crowd normally rallies behind the underdog.  seemed they were mostly on your side today.  was that reassuring, good support?
are you a man to whom history means a lot?  do you look and say, i have four, i can go for six?  does it not matter where you win, as long as you get the titles.
you faced two players outside the top hundred this week.  are there players you want to avoid in the wimbledon draw?  if you came up against this guy in the first round, how would you take that?
you must be extremely disappointed.  match point, the forehand for the win...
did you get a bit nervous?  there it was waiting for you to pass andy.  did you tighten up?
nevertheless, the whole of the week has been good for you?
how tough would it be to go to qualifiers at roehampton now?
it will be a different world.  there's 7,000 fans here.  maybe only a hundred or so at roehampton.  it will be a test for you mentally?
how many times have you played in the qualifiers before?  when was the last time?
do you know who you're playing yet?
what time are you playing tomorrow?
do you ask yourself why your fellow frenchman tsonga has been given a wildcard?
would you like to see them given a bit later in the tournament so if somebody like you reaches the final, it's automatic?
why as a frenchman do you say wimbledon is the greatest tournament?  do you have great memories growing up watching it on tv?
did you get an injury?  you were holding your hip.
you're okay physically?
have you surprised yourself at all with how well you played this week?
are you aware of wimbledon's history of qualifiers having a great run, starting with mcenroe?  do you think if you come through the qualifying, you can repeat what you've done this week?
you say you believe in your game.
a little bit easier than your last two matches against him.
fourth final.  how important is it?
if there is an aspect of your game you're not happy with, what would it be?
you mentioned struggling a bit with concentration yesterday.  that didn't appear to be a problem today.
do you get to expect rain delays when you're here?
the grass here at queen's, how does it compare with the grass at wimbledon?
here?
mahut in the final.  how do you feel about that?
are you surprised to see him in the final, beating nadal, ljubicic, proven players?
is this just the preparation you wanted when you left paris, come on the grass early, get five matches?
how much has jimmy connors added to your game?
you have that top speed record of 155 for the serve.  do you ever go out there thinking, i'm going to try to beat that today?
still hitting it faster and harder than anyone else.
and your confidence in general from when you first started this week to where you are?
you mentioned yesterday about having lost three times to roger at wimbledon in the final weekend.  is it harder to believe each time you go back after having lost to him?
what parts of your game do you think you've improved from last year?
do you see or think you see any signs of federer being less of a player than he was at last year's wimbledon?
not playing halle you don't think will make any difference to him?
you seemed disappointed with your performance on television.
as the season goes on, you're on your favorite surfaces, do you feel more pressure because you haven't won a title and you want to win towards the end of the season or the second half of the season?
you talked about your lapses in concentration.  how much of a worry is that with wimbledon just around the corner?
what was causing you to kind of drift off from the match?
how is it playing out there compared with other years?  the same?
what did you make of your opponent?  do you think he's someone that could be quite dangerous on this surface?
with the majors still to go, do you feel in order to live up to your expectations, you need to make the final or the semifinals of one of those tournaments to compete with nadal and federer that have been so dominant this season?
when you're playing at a club like this where you're so close to the fans, what has it been like this week walking around with a coach that's arguably more famous than you?
does he spend a lot of time talking to you about his time at wimbledon and giving you advice?
do you have any television recollections of him on wimbledon grass?
have you ever seen the old racquet?
yes.
how was it?
you say your primary objective is still to win wimbledon.  you've been close twice.  are you closer now or further away from achieving that aim?
the hawk-eye system has had some debate.  a great example today of how it can make a real positive difference?
what were your impressions of our chap out there today?
he said that.
what are his weapons?
how about your game?  how close do you think your game is to where it needs to be at for wimbledon?
how high should he set his bar, do you think?
we wouldn't dream of it (smiling).
you hadn't actually used the technology up till that point?
in the match, had you actually called for it?
a couple of quite close calls you just let go.
americans of quite a recent generation always used to try and get back for a bit of nbc for at least three or four days in between the french and british grass.  you spent all last week here.
i'm trying to be funny.
they used to like to get home, go back to the states, even if it was four days, whereas you have stayed through.
you don't feel over- europeaned?
did you get to the net as much as you wanted to today?
you practiced with alex before christmas in florida.  when you were hitting with him, did you think to yourself, this guy has a nice feel for the ball?
your working relationship with jimmy, is it still evolving?  is it in a groove now?
are you disappointed about losing or happy you played so well?
despite the result, is it fair to say that was the best performance of your career?
a lot of people have always known you have that great variety of shots.  he did play a lot to your backhand.  does that reiterate to you that you can really get up there and do things in this game?
what did he say to you when you walked back into the locker room?
what did roddick say to you?
what did he shout at you at the end of the second set?  did you pick that up?
for all that you played well in the match, do you curse hawk-eye for that call at 5-5?
what is your plan from here?
what sort of areas do you feel you still need to work on to make a further push?
were you surprised how much he did play to your backhand?
as an occasion, how does that compare to federer at wimbledon, nadal at wimbledon, and the two davis cups?
how would you assess your pre-wimbledon form?  you've had two matches at surbiton, three here.  in a nutshell, how do you assess it?
what is your situation with peter?  he's got a contract to a certain number of weeks in british tennis.
was that aubrey out there?
what does he do?
not coaching you?
is there a certain ranking you want to be by next year?  are you setting yourself certain targets?
will becoming british no.2 at some point in the future change how you approach your career?
you're yawning.  why are you tired?
how do you feel?
when you come to your first match on grass, you're playing someone who is 6'6", do you think it's going to be a very difficult match, someone who can serve that big?
a three-set match on grass can go very quickly.
you have to stay very focused?
how do you prepare your game for grass?  do you change your strategy at all?
you're entitled to be very tired.  you played a lot of tennis.  how do you feel inside yourself?
did it surprise you when roger pulled out of halle, said he was exhausted?
are you still thinking about paris or it's now all in the back?
yes.
do you think the british public here perhaps last year weren't quite sure what to expect from you, but this year you won roland garros again and there is a greater appreciation of you as a player from the british public this time, more warmth, support?
is it a good idea to use hawk-eye here and at wimbledon?
is it especially good to use it on such a fast surface?
you don't always trust it, though, do you?
does the fact that roger has broken his usual prewimbledon routine, feels unable to play at halle, does that offer encouragement to people like you and a few other players who can seriously challenge him at wimbledon and maybe break his run at wimbledon?
because you reached the final of wimbledon last year, do you have some different personal expectations on grass this year?
there is the suggestion from some of the past players that feel you would win wimbledon before roger wins the french.  do you have any comment on that?
some past players.  i think there was a suggestion from stich, ferreira.
thoughts on that one, novak?
are you finding it maybe a little easier than 12 months ago?  you had wimbledon last year.  do you expect to find it a little bit easier?
is that in the back of your mind, that potentially you could get an injury like that?
how much practice have you had on grass since coming here?
roger federer pulled out of halle, said he's exhausted.  only rafa has played more matches than you this year.  how do you feel now physically after the spring you've had?
perhaps not so many people knew about you last year, but now you've proven people should take notice.  would you like to be in the spotlight or would you prefer to go to wimbledon and maybe people focus on the other big guys?
can you cope with that?
your football team from serbia are in the european championships, under 21.  back home is the interest divided between yourself and them?
when was the last time you went home?  did you notice a difference between people coming up to you?
must make you proud, and also your family must be very proud.
who did you meet there?  the members of the government?
were the prime minister and president there last weekend when you went back?
does it seem quite strange?  you obviously always wanted to do what you're doing now, but if someone told you six years ago you'd be on first name terms with the prime minister and president...
when you're in a situation where you don't have a lot of experience on grass, the fact that rafa last year got all the way to the final, does that change people's attitudes in the locker room who say, "if rafa can do it, maybe i can do something"?
yes.  people are saying, "he did it last year."
when you met the president, did you call him mr. president or sir?
when jamie was a set and a break, what were you thinking?  he was really pushing himself, as well, shouting.
you must be pleased.  there's been quite a few instances where you haven't been able to claw your way back, but obviously you were able to.
a much bigger occasion tomorrow, isn't it?
that kind of goes against what you were saying a couple days ago, about being in the present, seeing a point, seeing a match for what it is.  you were looking ahead to another opportunity, were you?
six or 12 months ago you said you would have crumbled.  what do you put this steady resolve down to?  have you worked on anything in particular in the last year or so?
battling it out point by point?
how much of that is down to the influence of the guys you've been working with?
how many hours a day are you doing these days, alex?
that's considerably more than you used to do?
the situation at the moment, you can solve problems better under the new system where you have better support or someone like brad to go and hit with.  do you feel you're much better at problem solving?
when was the first one that actually happened, when you played poorly but still got through?
is a brit playing a brit in a big tournament in britain still almost tougher than anything?
if you're the favored brit.
playing andy roddick, does that inspire you?
your experience at wimbledon a couple years ago when you were first up, can you draw on that, remember what that was like?  in a sense, playing a big player on a grass court.
peter was saying after the doubles last night, you really got a lot out of that.  he could be accused of being biased, but he said you were the most accomplished player on the court.  can you tell us what marat said to you?
if you play well tomorrow and maybe get a decent run on grass, be it next week, wimbledon, how much of a message will this be to john lloyd in terms of there's a big match on grass in september?
you are available for selection?
do you feel there's still some attitudes that maybe people have to you or about you that you still have to change?
greg had a bit of input as well?
do you think you're mentally better prepared for this game than you have been in the past against the bigger players?
without the change to roger, do you think you could have ended up in another cul-de-sac?
what happened in the end after australia?  you were saying everything is positive, things looking up.  all of a sudden it just finished.
tough match?
why did it slip?
all those set points.
is that because you're just going for it and you're not planning it or is it you're more relaxed or...
have you worked with a sports psychologist on this or is this something you worked on with your coach?
is it anything to do because alex is your friend?  first-round win, you finished your man off.  why couldn't you have done it in this one?
obviously you're very disappointed today, but must be pleased overall how queen's has gone so far?
are you very self-critical?
are you working now solely with martin and keith or do you have any input from the lta's dream team, shall we say?
annacone, gilbert, blah blah blah?
when has he been with you?  what has he done with you?
of course, the davis cup captain thinks a lot of you, as well.
aside from the particular issue you talked about, what happened today, do you feel like you're improving?  if so, in what ways particularly?
looking forward to nottingham, what are your goals for that?  how far realistically do you think you can go?
where does grass figure in your surface preference list?
these few weeks where you have the opportunity to get atp tour-level matches and wins, do you think it's a bit of pressure?
it is an opportunity for you, isn't it?
looked at what this is going to do for your ranking?
does that make a big difference?  obviously you're getting some help from the lta, but...
pretty satisfying, wasn't it?
how much did it help getting to london last week and practicing on grass?
pretty dominant on your own serve.  had to be a bit patient to break him?
what was your take on the hawk-eye business?
how does that affect your attitude towards it?
do you think it's got an even bigger role to play on grass?
surprised wimbledon has moved with the times and adopted it?
can you say a bit about what jimmy has brought to your game?
hard to take anything positive out of that?
what are your thoughts on it?
is it just a confidence thing?
you mentioned before that you would consider playing nottingham.  is that now a certainty?
to do that very thing?
keep playing, keep getting matches?
how much does it try your patience?
to the point where it's difficult to keep trying?
there doesn't come a time, does there, at any stage where you consider a different voice in your ear might help?
a different voice might say something different.
you're quite happy with everything?
i wasn't necessarily saying that.  but someone might come along, inspire you in a different way.
is it just things not clicking?
do you think you've been putting a lot of pressure on yourself because you had a difficult start to the year; you're coming to your favorite part of the season?
(question regarding age, and the last two opponents being younger.)
comparing yourself now to 10 years ago, do you think more about matches, worry about confidence, things like that as you get older?
good win.
you proved in challengers you can do it and win titles.
it's a win in that manner, as well?
you're known as a guy that does get a bit tight at times.  what have you done to combat that?
now obviously peter lundgren is having a big input.  who is doing the physical work?
they're both very experienced guys, aren't they?
does he sit down and talk you through your experiences in davis cup when you've been in front of big crowds and that hasn't worked?  have you talked about that?
the way you dealt with it today was completely different.  today you broke, but then were broken, broke straight back.  you were serving for the match breakpoints down, but still came through.
has the fact that it's been a crowd there in the past affected you?
presumably after a match like that, you can think of what you did to come through?
rely on things you've actually done?
jamie in the second round.
not played him before?
talk about that.
he's been at saddlebrook, as well.
you've bumped into him?
practice with each other?
you must be very pleased.
alex in the second round.
how much do you think this will do to your confidence ahead of wimbledon?
you've played different players higher ranked.  have you worked out what one key is to beating them?
what do you say to yourself at 6-3, 5-3 down?
have you changed anything at all recently in your game off court, the way you prepare?
you appeared to have something written on your left hand.  was that to do with...
what did it say?
you say you wrote this down when you were 12?
do you still have that actual piece of paper?
do you look at it?
is that for motivation or tactics?
do you do that every match?
was it the sort of thing that said where you want to be in a certain number of years' time?  was that part of this mission statement, where you want to be in four years?
not wishing to go into content, but is it just one word, one buzz word?
on your hand?
is that phrasing from you or your coach?
all you?
a lot has been talked about your potential.  this is the time you have to start pushing on.  it's a good start today, isn't it?
as much as getting the wildcard into these events is great, does it also make you think this is the time of the season when i've really got to peak and do well because if i miss this opportunity, it's another 12 months before it comes 'round again?
on grass?
bradenton?
with keith?
who is that?
what is your record with alex?
how many hours were you putting in in the gym a day?
how would you rate your game today?
comparing wimbledon titles, how important is this us open title?  i know your priority is wimbledon, but how about this?
novak was talking about during the most important points he felt the nerves, felt the idea it was his first grand slam.  could you sense that from the other side of the net, that at those moments he was much more inexperienced?
you say it took you a while to kind of get used to new york and the show here.  i see you're wearing your black tonight, an afternoon match.  also walking in to the darth vader theme song.  how much of that is you?  how much of that is other people?  what do you think of all of that?
and the darth vader aspect?
yesterday davydenko called you lucky.  today a couple balls on the line.  he missed one by a millimeter.  are you lucky?
when you were down in the first set, what did you try to focus on?  what went through your mind at that moment, down 40-love?
do you see the potential for a rivalry with djokovic along with nadal?
is he good enough to step up to that level?
in many ways this was a different slam victory for you because your last three matches were all so close.  i guess you could have lost any of those matches.  has that made it any more special?
today tiger woods shot a 63 and had a come-from-behind victory in a tournament.  he has said that you are the most dominant athlete in sports.  what do you make of what he said on the day that you've just won your 12th slam?
you passed borg and laver today with your 12th.  how much do you think about the sampras record?  how badly do you want it?
when you're done, how many do you think you'll have?
do you think you're a significantly better player than you were a few years ago?  and if so, could you talk about that?
beside your passion for tennis and your new love for golf, how much are you interested in soccer?  european championship next year in your home country.  is this a sport which interests you a lot?
novak obviously has a lot of charisma off the court.  he sort of won over the fans, and here in the media room he's very funny and quick wit.  what do the players think of him?  what's his reputation among the players on tour?  what do you think of his personality?
what do you think of his personality?
davis cup next for you.  can you give me some comment on your chances and your opponents?
i think it's fair to say you were rather different at 20 to how you are now.  does novak remind you anything like you were at 20?
how do you define "craziness"?
you said after the match you had a stomachache, your hands were cold.  were you more nervous today than you have been?  when were you last this nervous before a major?
how long did it take you to calm down today?
he only made 53% of his first serves, yet stayed in it.  what was good about his second serve that kept him in the match?
this morning i heard a suggestion that you could be playing an exhibition early next year against pete sampras in the u.s. . what's the story on that?
novak, he's not ready for no.1, but do you think he's ready to take no.2 from nadal?
did he have you back on your heels in the first set at all, really coming on strong?
the shot-making seemed like it was there tonight.  were there mental breakdowns out there?  do you think the edge roger had was more mental than shot-making abilities?
if it's true that no player really knows how they're going to react when they reach their first grand slam final until the crisis comes up, five set points in the first set, is it also true it's out of your control when it gets there, you're just going to react the way your mind tells you to react?
after the overheating problems you had yesterday, what did you do after the semifinal before coming out to make sure it didn't happen again?
the health.
yes.
how long will those seven set points haunt you?
up until that seventh game you were playing a very high level.  he was as well.  what were you feeling out there?  first grand slam final, but you're pressuring him an awful lot and maybe even have the upper hand.  were you feeling relaxed, like it was easier than you expected?
you mentioned you were mentally weaker than he was mentally strong.  how much of that is a reflection of the fact you know he's not going to falter?
could you talk about roger's mind.  is that his greatest strength, he uses that to overcome tough situations?
on the seventh set point, you hit a forehand that missed by about a millimeter.  if that ball is in, how does this afternoon change?
going back to that point, could you believe how close it was?
you've handled just about everything tennis has thrown at you.  today was it just a little bit bigger stage than you were prepared for, or did you feel completely comfortable out there?
you're talking about you being unlucky.  yesterday davydenko said of roger when asked, what's the one thing roger does best, he said, lucky.  there were a couple of set points of his that the ball literally landed on the line.  were you feeling, wow, this guy really is lucky?
three years ago he was already no.1.  you were 17 years old, maybe not yet thinking about reaching a grand slam final.  was he ever your role model then, or other players?
maria sharapova was in your box and also robert de niro.  what are those two relationships with you?  somebody had to ask.
what does she think of your imitation?
how did you meet robert de niro?  did he just show up in your box?
can you look upon this experience as like you're paying your dues in a way; it may be a different story next time you meet federer in a grand slam final?
while it's true that how you play physically depends on how you play mentally, if for the sake of examining your game you could separate the physical from the mental part, do you feel your game is right there with roger physically right now?
you're a deep guy.
physically are you there?
serbian tennis is at an all-time high.  a big opportunity for serbia in davis cup.  how important is that occasion for you?
have you heard anything about janko's injury?
you came to this tournament not well-known by the american tennis fans except as the guy who beat rafa, roddick and federer in montral.  as they said in the awards ceremony, you stole our hearts.  do you have a sense of really what you've done?  you said you're very happy with what you've done on and off the court.
you said throughout this you take positives, you learn from matches.  tangibly what did you take from this match, learn about your game or yourself?
how did your legs hold up in this match?
when you look back at this match, will you have used the right tactics in playing him?
maybe more aggressive?
you were up 4-1 in the first.  you held serve at love.  i think he wins 12 straight points.  what happened at that point?
how do you think you'll look back at this us open in the future?
because of the hard court success you had here and some other tournaments, like miami last year, do you think you'll begin to consider yourself not just a clay court specialist but someone who's equally good on both surfaces?
you play well, but do you feel?
if federer wins, can novak beat him?
this is a grand slam.
were you nervous in this moment:  semifinals of a grand slam?
it looked like he was tiring in the second set.  body language, head down, trainer came out.  were you encouraged at that time you might have an advantage?
how were conditions out there today?  was the wind affecting your play?
what did novak do in montral that he was able to beat you, and how do you think it will be different tomorrow?
novak is a player who likes to joke around and do impersonations of the players.  what do you think of his impersonation of you?
he seems to be feeling pretty comfortable with where he is even though he really just came on the scene this year bigtime.  are you surprised with his rise so quickly?
how is it playing a guy you beat all the time?  is there sometimes the feeling he will break apart anyway mentally?
when the draw came out, the feeling was if not federer/nadal, then federer/djokovic.  is this the kind of match even you look forward to?
this will be your 10th grand slam final in a row.  you're going to be going for your 12th win.  do these numbers come into play at all when you're on the court?  are they in the back of your mind?
you've had some pretty amazing streaks in this sport.  where do you put your durability to play so many grand slams in a row?
just having missed none in such a long period of time.
given the consistency of your results in slams and against top 5 players, what do you think people think about the difficulty you have to surmount just to do what you do?
do you think people have an appropriate appreciation of the difficulty there is to do what you're doing?
there's a growing list of people that you have beaten repeatedly in slam finals, semifinals, quarterfinals, some of whom have never beaten you.  as great as that must feel for you, obviously not on the court, but do you ever have a feeling what it must be like to be on the other end of being part of the federer era?
what is that feeling?
how do you prepare for your opponents?  is it systematically perhaps looking at dvds, notes?  is it all up in your head?  it looks like in this tournament your first sets have been your feeling-out period.  can you discuss what you do in those first sets, too?
how often does it happen, if it happens, that you wake up in the morning and you say, oh, today, shoot, i have to play tennis?  also does it happen more often when you have to play a tournament or just when you have to practice and you prefer to go to the city?
do you remember your first grand slam final and what must novak going through?  do you remember what it felt like, what he might be feeling?
if you win tomorrow, it's going to be history winning the fourth time.  is that a special feeling for that?
are there any areas where djokovic matches up well with you or even has an edge?
coming back to the answer before when you said you don't need special preparation or something tactical for a match like tomorrow.  does that mean you're going to the match like improvising or do you have a certain plan?
were you watching the match going on now?
any impressions?
do you want them to play a pretty long time?
do you have a sense of what your achievement means back home in serbia, to make the finals?
in today's match, did you have any physical problem at the beginning of the second set?  it seemed so.
did you start to feel better as you went along?
can you talk about your box, the red, blue, white.  was that your idea?
whose idea was it?
you've had an extraordinary year.  in your heart, do you think you're ready to win a slam, a major?
all of your runs deep into these tournaments, will that help you?
are you concerned you've been out on the court 16 hours, that you'll be less than your physical best tomorrow in your first slam final?
what will you do between now and then to do that?
your gift for impersonation, does it have a serious side in a sense that you're able to pick up techniques or change techniques quickly when they're demonstrated to you by a coach or another player?
no.  we'll get to that in a second.  you are able to watch someone and immediately imitate them.  so when your coach shows you something or another player shows you something serious about tennis, are you also gifted at being able to...
i'm not sure you understood the question.  you are good at watching someone and doing what they do.  so when a coach in serious training shows you you should do this instead of this, are you better at picking that up than maybe somebody else would be?
we caught you in a bit of a white lie that you did not ever do federer impressions.  there's a thing on youtube showing you doing a wonderful federer impression.
is that just gamesmanship?  you just didn't want to say you did it?
what was the reaction in your country when you beat federer, and what do you think it would be if you played him tomorrow and beat him again?
no.3 in the world, in your first slam final.  whether you win the first slam tomorrow, do you have dreams of one day achieving some of the things that roger's already achieved?
roger committed 48 errors when you played him in montral.  do you remember how you were able to take him out of his game in that match?
what's the one thing that makes roger federer so tough?
is luck something just happens or is luck something that you make?
on the second set point, how difficult was it for you to watch the ball miss by so little?
do you think if you had won that set the day may have turned around for you?
how frustrating was that third set when you had the break ahead all the way through the set and just couldn't hold on?
losing always hurts.  some people think he's the greatest of all time.  does it hurt less to lose to federer than somebody else because you know he has this talent that is beyond almost anybody?
what do you think of tomorrow's final?
do you think you could have played any better than you did, essentially in the first two sets, and start of the third as well tonight?
what do you think the keys were, in the tiebreaks, just a couple points here or there?
is there any qualitative difference to you losing when you play well against him and losing when you play poorly?
does it just show how good he is?
how hard is it coming into these press conferences and dealing with questions about roger?
is it ever hard not to feel sorry for yourself that you were born into his generation?
do you still think you can beat him?
do you wonder what more you can do after playing, as you said, the best that you could?
did you feel from the beginning you knew it was going to be a riveting match?
that "piece of cake" remark, that's what michael said first before roger.  do you take that personally?
he was being sort of sarcastic about hard work, that you're an overnight sensation by working hard.
it is a question, yeah.
my question still stands.  did you take it personally?
he obviously served huge at key moments.  did you feel like, other than the one breakpoint, you had some chances?
as the match got away from you in the third set, seems like you had a lot of nervous energy.  getting up early in the changeovers.
would you say this is the best you ever played against him or the best you felt leaving a match against him?
when he reflexes back a 140 like you were talking about in the breaker, does it surprise you?
is he getting better?
what are your plans now?  are you going to stay in new york or go home?  next couple days?
is it harder to take a loss when you did play so well as opposed to a match where you said, i just didn't have it tonight?
did you enjoy the match, other than the end of it?
can you try to describe what is it like to be out there in that kind of a match?
don't you think you've shown in the last two or three matches you can hurt him?
could you describe how much pressure he puts any player under when you're trying to hold serve?
17 breakpoint opportunities.  in three sets, that seems likes an awful lot.
i was speaking to roman prokes, the racquet stringer.  i wonder how as a player you go about picking a racquet stringer, and how did you meet him?
how many racquets did you take out today and how many did you use?
how do you tell when to switch?
you got through some hard-fought matches in this tournament.  what positives do you take out of the tournament?
the matches against grosjean and james, did you find your body being taxed going in?
a lot of people have been talking about how the conditions have been slowed at a lot of tournaments over the last several years.  do you feel like davydenko's game has become more and more effective in the era of a slower court where he can use his speed more?
4-all in the second set tiebreak, you played a backhand service return.  i don't think i've ever seen anything like it.  landed at his feet.  he couldn't do anything about it.  do you practice those shots?
do you think that's the best tennis you've played thus far in this tournament?  is that what andy brings out in you?
there was a comment you made, sort of a throw-away comment:  "piece of cake."  andy came in and seemed to take offense to that.  he said, "piece of cake, i hope he certainly didn't think this match was a piece of cake."  was that just taken out of context?
how hard is it for you to sit in the dressing room, the women's match goes on, a third-set tiebreak, for a professional athlete to come out and be at their very best at 10:30 at night?  how tough is that?
did you think this was fantastic tennis?
were you particularly pleased with the way your second serve when you aced him i think four or five times.
it exasperates the opposition when you can do that.
speaking of minds, a lot of people think agassi is one of the best tennis minds in the sport.  he did a lot of commentary tonight.  he said when a player can count on two things to be the best in the world, then you have a dominant player.  but when it comes to you, you have closer to five things that are the best in the world.  do you sense you just are a step above in four or five different categories of the game?
so just being able to go from plan a to plan b, that in itself is a skill set, would you say?
andy declined to answer when i asked him if he thought you were getting better.  do you think you're getting better?
what are your thoughts on nadal not being here?
thoughts on davydenko?
once again today a rather large number of breakpoint opportunities for you.  can you feel your opponent at 15-40, love-40, begin to feel the pressure of your service returns and your game, so much that they go for too much on the serve, double-fault, make a mistake?
you have yet to lose a set in this year's tournament.  do you feel in the tournament that your body and your mind are as strong as you've ever felt before in a two-week tournament?
you spoke at the french open about how late in the tournament you're beginning to lose some strength in your arm, not being able to hit the ball as hard as you want.  how do you feel now after five matches here?
the two guys that you might face in the next round are players you haven't had the best results against before.  do you feel like you're in a different place mentally this time where you'll be able to play more consistently or better against whoever does come through that match tonight?
you did not beat roger at the french open but you played a strong match against him.  had a number of breakpoint opportunities.
how much difference does the surface here make in the result?
there's some who have said you have been one of the least noticeable top five players in quite some time.  since the events in poland, you've been thrown into the spotlight more.  could you talk about that more a little bit?  do you prefer to fly under the radar more than is happening now?
is there any good reason for you to watch tonight's match against roger and andy?
do you ever watch matches just for the entertainment value?
did you stay awake till the end, watch the whole thing?
after the game today you said to the audience that they helped out haas because he lives in florida, but against federer the audience should help you out a little more.  on the other hand, wouldn't you like to play better against roddick, who would get all the help from the audience, but for the game your chances would be higher than against federer?
i understand you're tired of all the questions about what occurred in poland.  do you think there is a problem with the sport that millions of dollars are spent in gambling in a one-on-one sport like tennis?
that's what you feel happened in poland?
you know david very well.  did you expect he can play on such a level like he played today?
how much were you hurting?  we saw the trainer came out.  looked like your finger, and still your knees.  what was going on with you physically during the match?
what about the physical condition of david?  seems he could reach everything.
how frustrated and disappointed are you to go out this early in a slam?
you never played gulbis before today.  did you know anything about him from other players or watching him play in either the robredo match or...
not to make you an old guy, but you've been around the game a long time.  what keeps it fresh, fun, interesting for you?
how close were you to retiring last year?
so if people start to say this is like a farewell tour for moya, they're mistaken?
what do you appreciate now about a win like that you were unable to appreciate when you were no.1 or younger?
have you had to change anything in your preparation or even when you play matches to compensate for being a little older?
you had a very memorable run here nine years ago.  how good does it feel to be back and have the ability to go out in this tournament atmosphere and play this kind of tennis?
what are your thoughts on facing djokovic?  he's playing so well.
do you enjoy the travel still?  or is it a necessary evil?
you're a big favorite with the fans, especially the women.  how much does that mean to you?  do you get letters, gifts?
what's more incredible:  that serbia has three players in the top five or that one small island in the mediterranean has produced the no.2 and former no.1 player?
djokovic said maybe it happened in serbia because of all the radiation from the bombing.
what do you think is the reason for mallorca?
in your mind -- you've beaten djokovic.  two slam semifinals.  but he had the statement in montral by beating the top three players.  what is more of a statement in your mind:  beating roddick, nadal and federer back to back, or reaching the semis of a major?
you atp to play at the hamlet cup.  do you wish there were more atp events in this area?
you played in the hamlet cup.  i think you enjoyed that area.  do you wish there were more atp events here in new york besides just the us open?
tell us all about yourself and latvian tennis.
are you from riga?
where do you train?
very difficult to deal with carlos' serve today?
you come to new york not having won very many matches this year.  how do you explain this?
what are the most positive things that you can take out of your stretch here?
new york city is a place where you can meet just about anybody of any nationality, get any kind of cuisine.  have you had latvians come up to you on the tournament grounds and introduce themselves?
it's a good feeling?
after beating robredo you said that your forehand was your confidence shot, that determines how you play.  today...
how did you get started?
yes.
how many languages do you speak?
did you make any predictions before this match the way you did before the last one to niki?
how many players are there in latvia?
i mean in the country itself.  do you have any idea?
or how many courts there are?
how closely watched are your achievements back home?
is there a latvian davis cup team?
if you play a davis cup match in latvia, is there a big enough stadium to play the matches?
basketball arena?
are the courts hard courts?
how about outdoors?
you grew up on clay?
you committed 48 winners, but also 64 unforced errors.  do you always play so aggressively?  it's your style?
64.
could you describe your feelings.
rafa said he didn't want to make any excuses regarding his physical condition.  he said you outplayed him tonight.
are you a little bit scared now to have not enough energy for the next game because you had a five-setter and now a four-setter and both games were intense and long?  tomorrow you can rest, but it took a lot of energy?
did you play a special strategy today or it was just a matter of perfect execution?
what do you know about chela, how you feel you'll match up against him?
have you ever seen a guy lose a point by a ball popping out of his pocket?
upset stomach, back problems.  how painful and difficult was that going into the third set today?
how long did it take the pills to kick in so you felt almost normal again?
your thoughts on facing carlos.
you've had three long matches here the last three rounds.  as you probably know here at the us open, semis are on saturday, finals on sunday.  in best-case scenario, you and rafael wind up in a three-and-a-half hour match on saturday, come back on sunday and play the final.
is it fair?
do you feel ready to break this stranglehold on 1 and 2 that roger and rafa have had for many, many weeks?
is it adding pressure on you as you're expected to go far in all the big tournaments now?
when you got broken back in the third set, what sort of mentality did you have from there on till the end of the match?
you broke first game, then he broke you right back.  you weren't happy about that, obviously.
have you always been somebody that likes to joke around a lot since you were a little kid?
what did you think when the ball fell out of his pocket in the middle of the match for the second time?
on your day off tomorrow, are your legs right now tired enough you want to take the entire day off or will you have a hit?
how are the legs right now?
in the second set, it looked like you were having difficulty breathing at some point.
nothing to do with the old problem you had?
is that good or bad, meaning good to win but not much activity?
how early did you spot there was something wrong?
was it because he asked for the trainer after the third game?
he said he couldn't breathe.
do you mind telling us if you went from there to hit some or if you plan to hit any more today?
how long did you spend?  are you feeling you got in a good day?
is it a positive or a negative to be so fresh?  you want to be fresh, but do you want to be this fresh?
what did he say to you at the net?
do you feel like you've been tested?  at what points during this tournament do you feel you've been tested?  by johansson?
will you watch federer's match tonight?  if so, at this point, do you ever learn anything from watching him on tv?
will you be rooting one way or another?
last night venus was saying either she or her sister could get to the finals.  you were playing well, james blake.  she said all of a sudden american tennis is looking pretty good.  could you make a comment on that?
does getting to a quarterfinal mean anything for you?  james hasn't been past, but you have.  do you have to make a couple more steps for it to be a successful tournament?
you spoke to the physical aspect of not being dead tired, better than the alternative.  a slam usually builds emotionally as well with each round.  you haven't gotten into an emotional rhythm.
that was my other career goal.
can you speak to that?  you said you haven't been tested.  now you're going to face the ultimate test maybe.  is that a problem, that you haven't had that mental time to prepare?
does strategy matter against roger or do you pretty much have to be perfect or almost perfect?
is there a difference playing him in the quarters and playing him in the final?  is there any benefit at all to get him in the quarters?
anything comparable for him today to the way you felt in the semifinals in indianapolis?
did you still worry about him?
you go into every match with the same preparation, but going into this next match if you play roger, can you feel the extra weight?
eight months have passed now.  can you reflect back on australia and just talk about what you think happened in that match.  going in there you were playing outstanding.
considering how well you played in the first set, was there any sense of relief he retired?
you say you don't think people expect anything of you in this match.  what do you mean?
when he gets open a roll like that, now that the australian open is over, have you thought what you can do when he starts playing like that?
your net game has become an important part of your game.  against roger it seems like sometimes he's drawing you in when he wants you to come in rather than you coming in on your own terms.
can you talk about that, because obviously it's not like you're going to play him completely from the baseline.
just talk about your approach to that.
is coming in to the net getting more instinctive for you?
did you watch isner's match against federer?
did you have any impressions?
didn't see the first set?
lopez didn't realize that you had won that many points on your serve.  were you aware of it as you were doing it?  35?
from the time you were down love-40 in the first game of the third set, you did not lose a point of your serve until that mishit.
that last game.
what was he doing in the first set?  was he playing out of his mind or doing something specific that was bothering you?
is part of your thinking in a case like that, let's see how long he can keep this up, or i don't expect him to keep this up?
after that first set the way he was playing, did he kind of make you play your best tennis?
were you happy to be tested that early in the match given how far along you are in the tournament?  you've got roddick coming up next.  was it good to be pushed a bit?
at the same time, you always seem to be extremely patient:  isner, lopez, when andy won a set last year.  you're not trying to go for too much.  was there a time earlier in your career where you would get down and perhaps panic in that situation?
when you beat somebody 13 out of 14 times like you have with andy and you're going into that match, do you just expect to win at that point, or can you block that out of your mind, that you've beaten somebody that many times?
is there any mystery to andy's game anymore?  do feel like you know absolutely everything he can throw at you?
so has your game plan against him changed then in the last couple years?
how much stronger is your backhand from, say, a year ago?  how much have you really focused on that?
you said after the isner match that you don't underestimate anybody anymore, and that's something that maybe in the past you used to do.  was that a big problem for you in the past, or a problem?
after all the twists and turns of breaking back, sort of all came down to two serves in the tiebreak.  could you go over those two points.  did you push the serve maybe too much?
you were on the court for 12 hours in four matches.  how much did fatigue play a factor in that match?
does it hurt any less knowing how hard you've worked?
what happened in that 6-love set?
when you have three match points like that, are you still feeling that adrenaline rush, even though you don't get them?
i know it's early for reflecting, but when you do look back on this us open, where do you think you'll place the achievement of getting your first five-set win?
will you watch the rest of the tournament or does this take your interest away for a little while?
a couple different achievements this summer.  your book is one of them.  can you talk about the significance of you telling an inspirational story in your life to other people, maybe it affecting them, whether they know you through tennis or not.  is that part of your body of work for your life?
tommy is somebody who has matched you for bumps, ups and downs, injuries, tragedies.
'02.
how much of the competitive pain that you're feeling right now will be mollified by davis cup coming up, looking forward to that?
when you go home you'll have extra days because of this early departure.
is there an indoor place to train, or is that necessary in the days before you leave?
fifth-set tiebreakers, just your general feeling about them.  how tough is it to play in a fifth-set tiebreaker in this kind of situation?
you've had a lot of success here and in new haven.  what are you going to have to do to translate that into the rest of the tour?  summer hard courts are strong for you, but other surfaces, other places.
did this match demonstrate the value of hawk-eye conclusively?
did you lose your concentration between or during the love game, after the tiebreaker?
during the tiebreaker.
what happened?  when did you start to feel bad?
was it your stomach?  what part of your body was it?
did you wake up like this this morning?
you were all right this morning before you went on the court?
could it have been related to nerves, being on ashe, anything like that?
if you had won the first set, would you have tried to continue?
what sort of medication did they give you on the changeover?
was it an aspirin?
how disappointed are you that you reached the fourth round, playing andy, didn't get a chance to finish?
some players don't get a lot of chances to get this far in a tournament.  are you disappointed you had a chance and weren't able to capitalize on it?
how did you think andy was playing?
did the illness come on during the tiebreak or before the tiebreak?
when you hit the shot down the line to give yourself a set point, how were you feeling at that point?
where you at any point dizzy like you were going to pass out?
you had a cold before.  a lot of people have colds this time of year.  is it like a cold?
yes.
do you still feel that way now or did it stop?
what treatment did they give you in the trainer's room?
not an iv, intravenous feeding?
intravenous feeding where they inject you.
are you in any pain or were you in any pain?
you didn't seem to be thinking about your knee when you were playing today.  was it a concern?
most people say that when they start, they get into the match and they forget about the pain.  particularly when you've won a tight first set, was it completely out of your mind at that point?
and it didn't hurt you at all during the rest of the match?
how is it limiting you?  is it limiting you on the court?
does the injury make it hard to know how well you're playing?  are you thinking more about the injury?  is it difficult to tell your level of play?
are you confident you can go up every round?
how important was it for you to get through this in straight sets, especially with the way you cruised through sets two and three today?
do you know which has helped your knee improve more, the rest or the laser treatment?
oh, lots of things.
will you have to take off much time after this tournament, do you think?
what's your record like against ferrer?
do you have memories --
4-1.
what memories do you have of playing in the past?
good job, robby.
kind of a long outing out there?
can you assess this close to it what you learned from it or do you have kind of think about it?
did you feel like the your game's coming together like 2005, but maybe a little consistency?
would you say this is your best showing so far for the year?
so how did you enjoy your first night match at ashe stadium?
you've risen so quickly to where you are.  how much adjustment does it take to get used to that?
was it important to have an easier match or quicker match tonight?
was there anything surprising to you about the night match?  anything that struck you as you didn't expect?
you had that one exchange of volleys with him.  you were winning that game by a lot, but still you were intent on chasing down all of those volleys.
how would you assess your match?
even in the first set you were in it all the way along.  what was the difference?
in tighter points, you've been incredibly confident last couple weeks.
what was it like getting to the third round here?
what is it like playing on armstrong?
what was the furthest you ever got in a grand slam tournament?
there were times when things started to go not your way and you looked pretty frustrated.  have you ever wondered whether that gives a guy a little encouragement or signal that, well, i've got this kid where i want him now?
is that a sign of lack of confidence?
is it maybe a lack of experience?  as you move forward, you get better at it?
having been to this spot, what do you think you learned in this short week, and what do you think going forward it will help you achieve?
what part of your game do you have to work on to reach the next step?
are you staying here?  in the city?
when you're walking around town, do people recognize you?
did you have like a nike cap on or racquet?
has anyone asked you about hitting the ball out of the stadium?
seems like you were holding it in the rest of the match, especially when you were tapping your foot.
yes.
did you have family out here today for this match?
best match since?  most efficient match since?
what did jimmy say to you?
it appears you're going to play berdych in the next round, although it's still up for grabs.  not much recent experience with him.  four-setter on clay.  what is your take on him?
pretty emphatic statement of intent today, it seemed.
and you did.
windy day.
do you ever watch video of your win here to try to inspire yourself, that emotion you had in the tournament?
how does it make you feel when you see it now?
does it seem like a long time ago?  fresh?
you carried the attention of american men's tennis for so long.  is it at all different today to have a lot of the attention be on john or to just be able to go out and play a match and not have that scrutiny as much?
is there enough of a curiosity factor that you'll watch the federer match after here?
what did you think?  i think it was 5-5 when you walked in here.
there's been a little spate of five-set matches recently.  now you've had an abandonment, a pretty breezy match today.  how do you feel physically?
did you watch james the other night at 12:30 or whatever?
what did you think of that match, what it meant for him?
what did you end up doing for your birthday?
what do you think of appalachian state beating michigan?
a situation where tim decided to retire from tennis this week.  he said yesterday that he felt when he played tsonga, it was symptomatic of the way the game has gone.  someone who can just go out and hit huge shots, which is why he feels he can no longer contend.  is it a shame in your mind that someone like that, who has the game he has, feels he can't contribute to tennis anymore?  in his way, it's become a one-dimensional kind of game.
sad to see him go?
do you have any other emotions when you see that 2003 video?
seeing it 15 times, is it almost embarrassing?
your thoughts on that one?
was there any stiffness or tiredness in the first couple of sets?
if someone said to you you'll get through a couple rounds and you'll go out in a tough one in the third, not having playing much as you have played, would you have taken that?
looking ahead to davis cup and obviously beyond that to the indoor season, do you feel like you've kind of got your year started again with those three matches?
is there a part of you that will be quite glad to see the back of this tournament?
how difficult has it been working with brad through the frustrations of the summer and how is your relationship with him now?
what is the schedule after davis cup?  where do you go?
how do you feel about the grandstand court and the crowd in there?
they got on you when you kicked that trash can away; did you feel like that was kind of a fair response or did it irritate you a little bit in the moment?
do you think you may end up a better player for the experiences of this summer?
do you have allow yourself to think of what might have been at french open and wimbledon given how well you were playing, or do you just put it out of your mind?
he had just beaten federer as well, hadn't he?
are you reassured that all the setbacks that you've had, when you step back it hasn't taken you very long to look or play as though you never had the time off almost?
does the wrist feel 100 percent now?
the circumstances of tim retiring and how emotional davis cup is going to be, does that make it more difficult?  does it give you extra motivation?  what's the different dimension of that?
do you feel it will take that long for you to feel absolutely right with everything and be right back in the groove as you were in australia, indian wells, and miami?  do you think it'll take that long for you be absolutely back in the groove and playing exactly the way you want to play?
you mean wimbledon in september?
just to make sure.
how much do you think that your team have advantage of practicing on grass courts and the croatians will be playing in beijing at that time?
is this the biggest davis cup match that you will be playing in?
no.
did you have a good time?
when you won the first set, did you think you had a shot?
so you said this was up there; up there like north carolina beats duke up there?
i mean like in your life, not just no tennis?
are you at all disappointed in your play?  you missed a couple net balls.
what do you take away from this match in terms of how far you've got to go?
i'm sure ricky prepped you on what to expect out there, but even with the preparation, were there things that you just couldn't get ready for?
at any time in changeover did you find yourself staring over at roger and saying, oh, my god, look where i'm at?
did roger say anything to you at the net or after the match or in the locker room?
what did you say to him?
you've obviously been watching him for a long time.  i'm wondering, you know what to expect from him, but what does it feel like to feel his game; was there anything that surprised you about it?
what did you think of his lob?
has anyone every done that to you.
how did you sleep last night?
last time an athlete from athens made the front page of the new york sports pages his name was herschel; have you heard from him at all and is there more pressure building on you to perform even better?
you're so fresh on the pro tour.  you know your volleying is going to get better, you know your groundstroking is going to get better.  a year, year and a half from now, when those improvements are made, is it possible to project how much closer you might be to federer then?
you said the pressure in college playing with a team for the national title was greater than with the pros; do you still feel that way?
if someone came up to you this spring and said, "hey, you're going make a run to the washington final and meet andy and then you're going make a run at us open and meet roger, going to be a heck of a lot hullabaloo," what would you say to them?
why the surge, why so much success from where you were such a short time ago?
will people be surprised at your progress and say, my god, you didn't win the ncaas, how good was the guy that beat you?
what's next for you?
has practicing with the davis cup squad helped further your development?
how can you compare the 23,000 at ashe stadium with the georgia fans who are in your face for sure?
yeah.
i would imagine you're a pretty big college football fan.  did you notice what appalachian state did and did you sort of think, well, if they can do that to michigan maybe i can pull it off?
when you were in high school did you play any other sports or strictly tennis?
would you have become like the first basketball/tennis double-star?
john lucas did?
forward or center?
you weren't full grown in 8th grade?
how difficult was his serve in the first set?
yeah.
was his serve in the first set.
have you ever faced a tougher serving opponent?
i think up to the third set the statistics of the match showed zero unforced errors for you and then 11 in a very short period of time.  what happened?  were you tired?
did you really feel attacked?
you said stats don't matter, but in the karlovic match you gave up seven points on your serve, and today in the second and third sets it was only four.  did you try to employ a similar strategy in that match as you did today?
did you think he's the kind of player who if top guys play him once they'll figure out something and maybe next time you meet him it won't be quite as hard?
he was a big surprise to everybody this summer.  how do you gauge his potential?
was that a fun match for you today?
because of the unknown of him?
how do you compare him to karlovic?
did you change your game all because he is so tall?
another tall guy, tomas berdych.  tall and big serve.
okay.
after the first-set tiebreaker the crowd is going crazy.  what's going through your mind at that point?
how big of a deal was it get that break in the first game of the second set?
what do you do to practice in preparation for that serve?
yesterday do you get a big sever to come and practice with you?
what do you think of gustavo kuerten trying to fight to play again?
what do you do between the matches?  how do you relax?
how do you feel going into the second week?  are you where you want to be?  do you still feel there are parts of your game that need to improve to get through the second week?
you were obviously happy with a lob over a 6'9" guy?
bit of an insult almost.  i think you enjoyed it.
was there anything about his game that surprised you?  you knew about the serve.
are you a creature of the night now the last couple of matches?
talk about the third set.  he said you were lucky to win that set.  do you feel that you were lucky?
are you learning to watch or pay attention beyond knowing what the time of the match is before you?
not so much close attention that you're riveted.
what changed, if anything, in between the third set and fourth set, because in that fourth set you just came out and hammered him and sent the crowd home happy.
a lot of breaks of serve.  mess with your rhythm?  was it tough to get momentum?
tommy haas on monday.  what are your feelings?
when you started the tiebreaker, the crowd, have you ever been through anything like that before?
why did you walk over the net?  why did you make a special point of going over the net to hug him?
have you ever done that much dancing on the court, jumping around?
how much does petr help you to overcome some of these things when you're with him?
what was the injury?
did you need surgery?
are new york fans different from french fans, english fans, australian fans?  if so, how?
do you think they're more knowledgeable here in new york than the other slams?
you looked so ready for the tiebreaker, enjoying yourself, telling the crowd to get loud.  how quickly did it get away from you?
why are you coming back into davis cup?
you were so close to the no.3 player in the world today.  after what he did in montral, do you think he deserves to be in that conversation with roger federer, rafael nadal?  is he right there or what does he need to do to get there?
does his bouncing the ball so many times before serve bother you?
yeah.  24 on match point.
is it possible to have a serious romance or be engaged and play your best tennis at the same time?
how are you dealing with this breakup?
what are your thoughts on the match today and the situation?
is there anything different about the grandstand court game, the closeness of it, the people on top of you?
have you played a lot on the grandstand?
you said he was going for it.  did you feel like you weren't going for it?
how is it going, your working together with hernan gumy?
what goes through your mind on a day when the things are completely going the opponent's way and you don't feel at your best?
you said the other day that you don't like looking back to the past to winning here.  you live in the present and look to the future.  what do you think the future holds now?
uh-huh.
do you still enjoy tennis as much as that day when those doors sort of went open and in came the lobster to celebrate your win?
when you won here in 2000, sampras said you were able to be no.1 in the world for as long a time as you wanted to.  do you think you still can go to the top?
you seem somewhat resigned to taking the losses.  does it bother you at all?
what do you think you might be doing if you stayed back home?
in the new russia, what kind of things have they done, your classmates?
how do you like wawrinka's game?
you mentioned doing things in new york city during the open.  what kind of things?
what part of the city?
do you think you will come to buenos aires to play the tournament there?
what are your davis cup thoughts right now?
do i think you'll play the states or sweden?
at what point in your life did you become able to put things in perspective the way you have now?  is it recent sort of development?
didn't miss much tonight, did he?
obviously you've been in pretty good form coming into it.  the draw was starting to look good for you.  must be particularly disappointed, are you?
a bit shell-shocked after that?  all happened so quickly.
would this be your preferred surface of all the grand slams?
what are your immediate plans?
will you be going back to australia before you go to belgrade?
you looked very much in control in that first set, first five games particularly went according to plan, managed to grind out the set.  what do you think was the turning point?
once his confidence got up, nothing seemed to stop him.
obviously it's going to take a few days to get over the disappointment.  it's a huge tie for davis cup, prospect of being relegated, whatnot?
djokovic is obviously going to be tough to handle.
are you prepared to play all three rubbers if need be?
was there sort of consolation having been involved in a pretty attractive sort of match?
decent finish to your career.
is there a place on tour for players who serve and volley as you?
and is that something to be lamented?
in a perfect world, you have the opportunity to watch two players playing tennis, who would those players be as a match-up?
yes.
did you know this year at the wimbledon championships that that would be your last time?
you're not a guy that shows emotion.  is there any emotion out there tonight or is it still unfinished business?
what will you do tonight?
was it good to play on a court like that in front of a crowd like that, go out with people sort of shouting your name?
is it possible for someone as competitive as you are to feel that they've maximized their talent?  are you leaving the game feeling that way?
it's not a results-based thing in the end?
compared to maybe this time last week, do you feel in better shape for the last challenge of your career?
are you generally more optimistic about the team's chances?
do you think it's going to be a challenge for you to kind of deal with the emotional...
how do you think you're going to do that?
have you been greeted in the street by people saying, don't do it?
how does that make you feel?
when is the baby actually due?
you competed against many generations.  what has been the toughest opponent for you?
did you say the semifinal you got to in paris was probably the most surprising result of your career?
what's the best you've ever played?
the match you lost to ivanisevic, the biggest disappointment, biggest opportunity you think you missed?
if you were not retiring today, but starting your career, would you still choose serve and volley?
is there one match that you can reflect on now, the way you played, gave you the greatest satisfaction?
on court 2, wasn't it?
what was the biggest disappointment with the press?
nice work, 75 minutes.  like a set for some of those other guys today.
what do you have going later?
what was working for you?
with the season you've had, how do you explain what's going on here?
you're 10-15 in the other three slams, 12-6 here.  that's almost ridiculous.
you must have thought about it.
is 2005 something that sustains you maybe when things aren't going so well?  that's your best grand slam to date.
what went wrong specifically at the beginning of the year?
you and john isner -- well, he played in georgia, you're from there.  what do you think about his chances against federer tomorrow?
do you think he does?
looked like you were pretty much in control there in the fifth set, then it kind of got away from you.
does this match typify what your career has been about, playing well on the court but ultimately not prevailing in this type of situation?
when you say you froze, what do you mean?
even the last game it seemed like you were pushing yourself to swing out.  you'd hit a couple good forehands.  came in and missed the two easy backhand volleys.
how does your mind switch out?  you did such a good job of making it through the breaker.  playing well in the fifth.  all of a sudden that mardy fish goes away.
what kind of factor was the crowd?
james kept us up pretty late last night.  did he keep you up?
it was a special match.
do you feel like the experience of being in a match like that would be the best way to avoid that tightness the next time you're in it?
did you need to take an iv after the match, intravenous feeding?
can you describe for us what it was like to be part of that match, the atmosphere, and then to win it obviously?
right before the tiebreaker, he started getting the crowd involved.  then you raised your arms a lot.  did that actually psych you up coming into the tiebreaker?
were you cramping at the end?
and what were the reasons for the calls to the trainer?
speaking of entertaining matches, tomorrow roger will probably be playing john isner.
do you think that match is worth all the hype it has and will generate?
there were a lot of long, grinding points in this match.  do you feel like you played aggressively enough off the ground in this match?
is one of the main differences between this season and last season that you can win even when you don't play your best?
pretty unusual to be attacked like that and have to see a lot of volleying?  you don't see many players doing that, do you?
are there points that are still very memorable in the match to you?  maybe second set tiebreak?
the half volley that you kind of danced afterwards.
what have you heard from friends of yours or fellow players?  much reaction to the match yet?
one particularly memorable point:  the lob volley he hit that you had to turn and run for just beyond the baseline.  you jumped three feet in the air.  do you remember it?
a lob volley.  you had to turn from the net, run back.
you had the two long matches at wimbledon, baghdatis and hewitt, and then you ran out of gas against nadal.  are you worried about that here?
is your fitness something you think needs improvement?  the french last year, wimbledon this year.
is it difficult late in the match not to think about how disappointed you would be to go out that early?
do you feel like you've played your best tennis at the grand slam events?
juan martin del potro next.  comments about him?
did you watch any of the blake match last night?
are you looking forward to an ashe stadium appearance yourself this time around?
pretty nice to get into the third round?
were you surprised when you heard the news?
do you ever wonder whether that's a good decision?  us open, last slam of the year.  he's playing a young, inexperienced guy.  surprised he would pull out under the circumstances?
can you talk about where you find yourself right now?  a couple weeks ago you had never won on the atp tour.  all of a sudden you win a match, you almost beat davydenko, you're in the third round of the us open.  is it registering?
how does it feel?  are you excited?
when you went out to play your last match, did you go out as a different player?
will you go into some detail about how david is assisting with your game, what he's doing for you?
for example, some of the things that he's seen that maybe have helped you.
how much do you weigh right now?
some of the people who saw your earlier matches said you appear to be hitting with a little more power, more weight on that lefty serve.  is that accurate?
when davydenko said in new haven that he feared you on both sides unlike any other american, what did you think of that statement?
if you could replay the end of the davydenko match, that short angle cross-court passing shot he hit, did that shake you a little bit?  would you replay that in a different way if you had a chance?
technically compared to last year at this time, how is your game different specifically?  what are you doing better?
have guys come up to you in the locker room to congratulate you once you get that first win and in new haven?  did guys come up and say, congratulations, well done, it's about time?
are you inclined to come down to boca after the usta moves in there and train with the other juniors?
yesterday mardy fish said that if a guy named roger wasn't around, andy might have a couple more slams.  i think andy for sure would have two or three more, and james might have won the us open last year or the year before.  any comment on that?
can you talk about acasuso in the first set, his game, how he played a little bit against you?
can you talk about playing here in new york, how this tournament might be a little bit different from other tournaments.
how long did it take for you to get over the 2005 mojo debacle?  did it wear on you to meet with the american express people after it was over and say, you guys don't ever do that again?
when you broke for 5-2 in that third set, it was a wonderful volley exchange.  you said something afterwards.  do you remember what you said?
it seems a better competition this one if the past was only federer/nadal.  now it also seems like you, djokovic, blake in good form.  how do you think on this?
there are a lot of players in good form during this one.
you really seemed to have a lot of momentum after that volley exchange, the love service game.  is any disappointment that you couldn't keep playing, that he did have to default?
you have a pretty stellar tiebreak record this year.  can you talk about the importance of managing tiebreaks tactically and mentally, particularly at a slam where you could take one in the fifth set?
do you practice it more coming into the hard court season?
if you were giving a scouting report on federer against john isner, how do you see that match playing out?
you play so much tennis, so much on hard courts.  i don't think you have tendinitis issues.  if not, why not?  is there an obvious reason to you why that hasn't been an issue for you?
sorry, i didn't know that.
in basketball, baseball, the whole key is making adjustments for the other team.  in this tournament, the day, night, heat, cooler, are there greater adjustments than any of the other slams?
how about playing under the lights?  are the lights here good enough that it doesn't matter?
when you were a kid, i have to assume you had birthday parties.  are there any particular that stand out as most memorable for you other than the last five years here?
were there any pony rides in your past?
i'm talking about when you were four.
yes.
ever interviewed by an opponent before?
have you and james blake ever sat together and talked about each other's game, even in jest, analyzed it critically at all?
what would you make fun of?
you said you weren't panicking after losing the first set, which makes sense.  were you okay with the way you played the first set?
jonas bjorkman just said that the swedes for davis cup would not just have a fast court, but it would be like lightening fast, like an ice rink.  he said it was because of johansson's serve.  what is your response to that or thoughts on that comment?
do you feel the faster the better in terms of your serve?
do you think you're better equipped to deal with the effects of tendinitis because you grew up on the hard courts compared to maybe jose and also rafa who have been complaining they need to make sure there aren't more hard court tournaments?
adding to the schedule.
is it patellar tendinitis?
if a guy can come here, do a little press conference, i don't know if you warmed up, do you think he should try to play a match?  i'm talking about gasquet pulling out.  should he have tried to play the match?
did you expect him to retire from this match?  at one point when he called the trainer he was shaking his head to his player's box.
we've seen a lot of players coming from college tennis.  what can you say about this way?  that wasn't your way, but what can you say about it?
if you don't have potential to be like no.10 and win the juniors, is that a good way to go?
isn't that a reason to go to college?  tennis, and an educational aspect?
why don't you play doubles more?
we haven't heard what you're doing for your birthday.  if we promise not to show up, will you tell us?
is there something new with your charity bracelet?
you had to battle hard there today, didn't you?
how pleasing is it to win a five-setter like that?
were you aware of his excellent five-set record?
it was 29-12 before today.
how does your body feel after a very stern test?
more specifically, the wrist?  fine?
i noticed you didn't even wear a sweat band.
did you ever come close to having surgery on it?
do anything special for it after you finish?  ice it after you finish?
is it the toughest physical conditions of anywhere here?
do you know anything about your next opponent?
were you surprised he beat caas?
where is the court speed in your comfort zone?  where does it fit in?
do you get a chance to do anything in new york away from tennis during these two weeks?
obviously i know what it's like for you in the uk.  do new yorkers recognize you?  do americans know who you are when you're walking on the street?
is the psychologist still here?
while he's been here, has he been working with you on anything, or did he just come to see you?
when you left cincinnati in a bit of a trough, could you have envisaged beating such a good five-set player within a couple of weeks like bjorkman?
a match like this where you have so many ups and downs, so long a road, is it worth three or four matches in terms of the experience factor in getting you back to where you're really comfortable?
did you watch the match last night of federer?
the women are making all these fashion statements.  roger made this statement.  could you see yourself doing something like that?  what do you think of him?
what does the treatment entail on your wrist?  would rest be the better option, but it's not really an option because it's the us open?
what was the treatment?  what sort of treatment did you have?
do you feel the isner/federer matchup is worth the hype that it's starting to generate?
you were practicing earlier this morning.  what happened?
when did it start coming on?
why can't you play?  it's not your legs or your shoulder, your arm.  what is so difficult about playing?
if you were sick, why did you play at all?  why did you even consider playing at all?
what would you consider your chances to be to win here, the whole thing?
no, no.  before the tournament, what did you think your chances were?
did you think maybe to give it a shot, maybe in a few days you'd get better, go out, maybe retire in the match?
the phrase "get the monkey off your back" is a common phrase, but it's not very descriptive when push comes to shove.  what does this really mean to you?
is there a little bit of an irony after this five-set win that you're playing stefan koubek next?
second.
what did you say to fabrice at the end of the match?
how much is lack of success previously, how much of that missing link has that been important for you?
did it have a larger impact for you?  i mean, not just next time you go to a fifth set knowing you can win it, but...
there was a major crisis in the ninth game of the final set.  three break points you're facing.
what's the mentality?
how many times have you hit three winning lobs in a match?
what's the best part of playing at home and what's the worst part of playing at home?
how frustrating was his style?  it seemed to bothering you that he was taking a lot of time between points.
what are your expectations for the rest of the tournament?
did you have to play too many long serving games?
what did you make of him?  first time you played him you said you were interested to see what he'd come up with.  what do you think he's got?
one criticism appears to be a lack of fitness.  if he can keep rolling on for three and a half hours plus on a very hot day, that can't be the case, can it?
can you see anywhere where he might still work on his game?
it seems like several players are struggling a bit with tendinitis in their knees.  i'm wondering if in the course of your career you had that problem and maybe if not why you haven't?  finally, if you could comment on this particular surface, my impression is it takes more pounding, is harder on the knees than some other surfaces.  i'm wondering if that is so?
if you were a sportswriter and your editor said, give us a short preview of the upcoming davis cup, what would you say succinctly?
the history, when us big bad americans come into town and you seem to bring us down, does that sort of play into it?
chances there will be a good ole tantrum like the old days from blake, roddick or the bryans?  any chance we'll see a connors-like tantrum?
say you had a list of the top sports in sweden, where does tennis count?
what is the surface and how will it play?
you said in sweden it's a mentality that unless we win, we suck.  we sort of have that attitude here.  do you know any country in all of your travels where the fans are really satisfied or the federation is satisfied with the results?
the fact that borg came out of his shell, came to wimbledon, played the oldies, could that help?
you were saying the other day you've actually funded the swedish tennis magazine.  how did that all come about?
what was that called?
enough going on in that match for you to lose your cool, but you didn't.  are you pleased with the way you kept your poise today?
did you ever have anything like that happen to you on match point, the sound system going off?
a lot of times in the last couple years at grand slams you've had tough first- and second-round matches, paid the price later in the tournament.  was it important to get it over and done with in three sets today?
how important is it to know you can keep your cool?  maybe proved something to yourself mentally.
your debut was 10 years ago.  you won it a couple years later.  you solved the open.  why do you think you haven't been able to solve it since then?
do you still look back on the 2000 final as the best match of your career?
do you ever think back about that tray of vodka that was rolled into the press conference after you won?  do you remember that?
your colleagues rolled in a tray.
you weren't drinking?
if you don't want to look back on it, do you look forward, see yourself doing that again?  do you see yourself winning this tournament?
what is "preparing for the worst"?
you mentioned people who sort of live in the past.  do you think that happens a lot in tennis?
yes.
will it matter to you 30 years from now when somebody says, marat safin won the us open and somebody says, i don't care?
his children.
what is your motivation level right now to be the best player you can be?
are you motivated to play?
short of an injury to nadal or federer, how do you break into that rivalry?  how does another player crack in?
many people have always felt that you could possibly have achieved more.  is that sacrifice too much for some people?
what advice did you give gumy when he decided to be your coach?
what has been the biggest enemy in your career:  your mind or your body?
what was your reaction to the investigation of davydenko?  have you spoken with him?
this is the only major with a breaker in the fifth set.  do you think that should change?
you won a challenge today.  do you still disbelieve the camera thing?
you have never really agreed it was accurate before.
so when you see it now, you're believing it more than you used to?
where have you been the last few years?
how exciting was it to be on the big stage?
obviously you have a career-high ranking.  optimistic about going even further?
what will you take from the match today?
did you sense that he was hurting?
what do you think lost it for you?
you seemed to fade out at the start of the third set.  were you just distracted by the fact the crowd got behind you?
did you understand that line call the 11th game of the third set where you challenged, ball was ruled out, second serve?
do you think his knee injury will limit him from doing very well here or do you think he can get to a final?
a lot of interest in you in australia today.  can you give us a history of when you came to australia from south africa, where you've been living?
seen the movie wimbledon.  what is the extent of your acting career?
was that enjoyable?
there was some suggestion on the tv commentary because the earlier match had finished early and they couldn't find you because they didn't know what you looked like.  is that true?
do you get any sort of banter in the locker room about your wimbledon movie appearance?
no one calls you tom?
any players in particular that call you tom that we would know?
how long were you on screen?
in the match today, is it all a letdown to play a top player when he's not at his best?
yes.
you talked about the loose service game at 4-3.  were you just sitting there thinking ahead?
did you do much better than you expected today?
you faded in the aussie open.
at what point in your career did you contemplate retirement?  did you stay away from the game for a few years?
why did you leave the game and why did you come back?
who were you coaching?  how difficult was it being on the sidelines in tennis?
where from here?
did you coach in canberra?
at a club?
what year was that?
were you contemplating being out of tennis all together?
what were you going to do?
like what?
was it a speaking part in the movie?
you said you're one of three children.
anyone from your family here with you today?
they were in the stands.
is that the best crowd response you've had in your career?
this was your eighth match on a tour level.
how long do you give yourself?  you're 27 in a sport where 30 is ancient.  do you look at wayne arthurs?
does wayne arthurs serve as an inspiration?
when you're looking at nadal on the other side of the net, knowing what you know of him, how limited did he seem to you today?
surprised to find yourself leading 4-1 in that set?
there wasn't a moment at that score line you thought, what am i doing here?
if you could change something about the match, what would you change?
how did you find out you were playing rafa?  did somebody text you?
what did you say?  was it printable?
how long have you been with the ais?
did he seem like the "real nadal" out there?
what do you mean by that?  you think he won't go as far as he could otherwise?
when he talks?
do you have any sort of goals short-term, how to get to the top hundred?
is that a good surface for you?
you mentioned you were behind a shovel for three months.  what project was that?  a big caterpillar or a real shovel?
for what project?
was he wearing a welsh jumper at the world cup?
i meant your dad.
couple months ago you said you really didn't pay much attention to pro tennis besides federer.  is that going to help you out?
i can't imagine you are aware, but the tv broadcast was sort of bouncing between federer's match and yours.  according to john mcenroe, right when you had set point, federer looked up at the score and saw that you had won the match, then proceeded to lose his serve.  mcenroe's theory was that this somewhat rattles him, the prospect of facing you.  could you respond to that?
can you go into that match really believing you can win?
does this all seem a little surreal to you, i mean what's happened?
at what point did you know, was it after washington or during washington, that outside your serve you could stay with the pro guys from the ground?
do you hit out much more in practice than you do during matches?  do you really rip your groundstrokes in practice?
because of your game, you live and die by the tiebreak a lot.  obviously in d.c. that was a big factor, and here tonight.  your tiebreak record is decent but not really that great.  it's 11-7.  talk about the tiebreak in your own game, the importance of that.
do you practice tiebreakers more because of your style?
does the college world seem a million miles away right now?
do you approach these matches like you don't have anything to lose?
federer said if he had to play himself he would attack a lot.  do you see yourself changing your game any more when you play him off the ground?
you were understandably tired at the end of legg mason.  i'm wondering how fit or how well-rested you feel now.  also the amount of rest between now and saturday, is that a good amount, too much?
have you thought about who you might ask for advice or tips on facing federer?
when you watched him play on television, did you ever imagine yourself playing him?
how many tickets are you going to ask for?
did you have a nickname on the bulldog team?
as far as the crowd reaction, have you gotten used to hearing all the barking while you're out there?
could you remind us your coaching situation.  they hooked you up with somebody with the usta.
do you still talk to your coach from home, too?
i know you said your dad doesn't like to watch you play, but federer, arthur ashe, he won't be coming?
so he's here?
would you get nervous if he was sitting close or is it vice versa?
the conventional wisdom is that promising players should skip college and get right into this.  you seem to be disproving that.  did college tennis prepare you for this?
in what way?
what was your best win in the juniors?
have you contemplated how much this might help recruiting at the university of georgia?
are the lower expectations tough to deal with here?  kind of the lower expectations so to speak?  trying to get your feelings from the business side of all this.
rightly or wrongly, in america we don't settle for silver or bronze medals.  is that the american sports psyche?
been a while since you've won two in a row.  a tough season.  you can make an argument that you've never played a bad match at the us open, considering agassi.
what happens when you get here?  you're like a different player.
do you have some kind of formula you want to use to take what you're bottling here?
given you do perform well here, and it's an american stage, american television, what do you think it's going to take for you to have that breakthrough and that run to go all the way?
do you change your game at all for the us open based on the surface?
is this normally the kind of player that gives you trouble, a little guy with great hands?
even though jose worked with sampras and many others, he sometimes is tagged as a clay court coach.  what makes jose so special as a coach?
what are the one or two things he's worked mostly on with you?
how much is it also, from a mental perspective, give you confidence that you can do this, that's you've got the talent, as opposed to just the stroke?
how many coaches have there been since francisco?
stability at that particular phase of your career, how important is that going to be for you?  a couple of changes in the last couple years, particularly when you're riding a streak, does that set you back?
yes.
so what do you think of the contention that actually the best coach in tennis today is roger federer?
can just the fact you're playing roger federer almost psych out players of your caliber?
do you go west or does jose come east?
long flight?
is coaching overrated, do you think?
guys seem to change coaches so frequently, sometimes you have to say, what effect are they really having?
you won some pretty crucial tiebreaks when you made your run to the semis.  how important is that?
another southern boy named john isner.
what was he like as a junior?
roddick, blake, fish, ginepri, another us open?
not now.
todd says he's perfectly okay with you.  what was behind the split?
how big is this open to finally put american tennis back on the map?
but he is around.  americans aren't ready to accept less.
who are you working with now?
he was part of the boca mafia?
how disruptive is it every time you make a coaching change?
when isner first came down to saddlebrook to work you hit with him.  what did you think?
when did you stop working with todd?
you played probably your best tennis the last couple weeks.  how much weight do you put into a coach in tennis?
what kind of reasoning did todd give for not wanting to continue?
can bo be hard on you if you need that?
you are a tour veteran.  why is it the john isners seem to be able to have breakthrough tournaments and get deep a couple weeks in a row and arrive here as the stars?  why is it as a tour veteran -- being a veteran, why doesn't it seem to turn for you?
we don't read about mardy fish making a run through.  djokovic has game but he's still kind of new.
you sound like you're content to be a journeyman than a contender.
most everybody has a good justin gimelstob story.  do you have one?
these former champions like safin, moya, do you look at them as legitimate threats to win majors anymore, contenders?
safin.
do you feel that way about marat?
if something should happen to andy or james at this tournament injury-wise, is john isner mature enough to go off to sweden and play davis cup?
how do you feel you played tonight?
your next match against isner, decent chance you're going to be heading into some tiebreakers.  your tiebreak record is 19-6 this year.  can you talk about your mental preparation for this, how important tiebreakers are, particularly at a major?
does a guy like that have an advantage in a tiebreak with a serve like that?
how much, if at all, have you seen him play and what do you know about him?
are you going to ask ivo to practice with you before the next match?
was there any hesitancy to change color since you've worn blue here ever since you won in '04?
usually it's a fashion show for the girls.  guys are usually left out of that.  you made a statement with the black.
how can you not be thinking about tiebreaks with a guy that won five matches in a row 7-6 in the third?
you have a good record in tiebreakers.  what's your strategy going into them?
you said you saw a few games of his.  what did you think?  is it going to be uncomfortable to play against somebody so tall with such a big serve?
when did you find out he was going to be your opponent?
first set tiebreaker, seemed like you were close to taking it.
james tries a lot of those between-the-legs shots.  have you seen more of that?
what is your success ratio with it over the years?
do you think there's more of a rise in showmanship, going the extra mile?
we see the end results of those between-the-leg shots.  when you first try them, how long does it take?
how many times not hurting yourself?  did you hurt yourself the first couple times?
andre hit one at the open over his shoulder.
that was actually more spectacular.  what's the most spectacular you've ever seen?
that wasn't the guga match?
what do you think of the j block?
how does it affect you as his opponent?
i guess it was not the result you expected after a pretty fun summer.
what happened?  you had six set points in the first set.
is it a question of sort of match management at this point, consistency?
had you been practicing against left-handers in the run up to the tournament?
you've played a number of left-handers over your career.  has it been a pattern where you can't seem to read them, the hooking forehand?
on the tour?
in juniors, you have?
is it more mental or really just the ball you don't like?
how disappointing is it, considering you really turned things around since we saw you in l.a.?
what do you take away from your first full grand slam season?
you mentioned you felt kind of out of it.  when was the last time you felt like you kind of lost concentration that much?
is it harder coming in this year because there were more expectations around you?
you were saying it was like a wimbledon rerun.  you lost the first set in a breaker, then...
mentally how did you feel in the second and third sets?
it's maybe an experience thing?
when you feel yourself hurrying, do you tell yourself to slow down?
do you think having a coach on court would help you in that circumstance?
would you push for it?
do you typically watch game film of yourself after your slams?
this one never?
stefan played pretty well.
seemed like he was having his way with some of your topspin shots.
you have the doubles left.  how did you hook up with your partner?
is it a way to work on your game?
other guys around your age, donald young, jesse levine, did you play against those guys?
are you surprised to see the results they're having?
when you were trying to decide between usc and professional tennis, what factors weighed most heavily?
that was a big factor in your mind?
was there any doubt in your mind you could make an impact on the atp tour?
do you think guys go to college less now in the states?
why?
most of the world's top 25 hasn't gone to college.  james blake is an anomaly.
you see somebody like john isner, a different way.  seems like it's working.
what's the one thing on the pro tour end that's surprised you the most?
where does your schedule take you from here?
back on the road a lot.
after a match like that, how important is it to come away with a victory?
you seemed pretty exasperated or frustrated he took that timeout.  could you believe at that time he's getting medical attention?
there's been a lot of talk about who are the next americans.  you and john have had good summers, big wins.  talk about your rise this summer.
is there something that changed this summer?
what did montral do for you confidence-wise?
when you said "coming to grips with who you are"?
you mentioned your trainer.  how much did that play a part?
where do you train?
what is your coaching situation?
do you have something set up with the evert academy?
what age were you with when you came from south africa to south florida?
both of your parents are south african?
john has talked about going to college, and how each player has to make different decisions as to what to do.  can you talk about your decision when you went pro?
could you describe your expectation before and after the game?
is that your longest match?
how about your next round?
chela.
do you feel confident physically bouncing back from five sets?
who are you with sponsor-wise?
is your dad a jeweler?
jewelry story?
is your family here?
nice start to the campaign.
you had a very good crowd.  how do you feel about having so many americans who may not know you come over to see you?
how is your overall hard court game?  are you playing now like you did in montral or like you did in cincinnati?
you've become the hot guy here.  is the business side of winning here on your mind, as well, winning in new york city?
what is the biggest reason you are a good player?  obviously you have talent, but what has brought you along?  family?  federation?  school of tennis?
serbian tennis is the big tennis story this year.  does the success of ana and jelena put pressure on you?
do you and ana and jelena talk while you're on tour?
a couple years ago you were one of five teenagers with a lot of potential.  how have you distanced yourself since then from the pack to get to no.3?
what specifically from being no.16 last year to no.3 last year is different about you?  what is better?
roger federer has said because you've never made it to a grand slam final he doesn't view you yet as a true challenge to him and obstacle to him at this year's us open.  in your opinion, does he respect you, your game?
when you beat all three of those guys, it's rare that you see a player having a breakthrough in one place.  what did it feel like?  as the day went by, did you feel the confidence more?  what was that like to live through that?
how much of an ambition it is of yours to make tennis a conversation of a third player, a three-way rivalry?
the other day you talked about your new impression of roger.  what do you do with him?
what are you doing?
is your family building a tennis facility?
you will own it privately, your family?
it will be open to all?
it's been a really rough stretch.
what's up?
when did you change coaches?
by the same token, you lose to a guy who was the youngest no.1 in history, won big matches.  does he get underestimated at all?
can you talk about the arrangement with scott?
is pauly still involved?
did you consider yourself a streaky player even in college?
are you comfortable talking about the changes you're making?
the other thing about being streaky, you live off adrenaline.  how do you wean yourself off that fuel?
he's got a reputation for being a great returner.  his serve gave you some trouble today.  is that an underrated part of his game?
why isn't he getting those breakthrough wins at the big events?  for a while he was off the radar.  looks a little bit like the game has passed him by.  what is your take as a player watching him?
you were excited when you reached the ranking point when you could play tour events.  you're still on the bubble.  during the telecast, jim courier said that this guy needs to drop down to the challenger level, play matches, get his confidence back.  what are your feelings about that?
a lot of points to defend because you had a great end of last year.
thinking about college, what was your thought process?
yes.
did you consider turning pro?
you mentioned the nasdaq.
i didn't get the gist of that.  what year was that?
why do you think we don't see more college guys in the top 20 or 30?
temperamentally, you have a choice of grinding more, playing from the baseline, coming up, developing a mirnyi-type attack.  what suits you better?
what does scott want you to do?
in high school you probably had more in common with hantuchova than nadal.  you were a think high school kid.  at illinois you really bulked up.  what kind of affect did craig have on you work ethic?
was it you specific?
i heard the remark you said at the end about harry potter and federer.  you've always been a very realistic person in saying that he's good.  would it be better if you had an attitude of, i don't care who he is, i can catch him, or your makeup is that this is okay the way it is?
you said you like being the underdog.
being a finalist in cincinnati, and winner in new haven, would you say you are in our best moment?
talk about the first set and saving those two set points.
when he missed that forehand, you had a little pep in your step when you switched sides.  what were you thinking?
after what happened with calleri, those two set points, didn't seem much.
over the years you've been very open about a lot of things, but you've also kept things close to the vest.  obviously you put a lot into your book that you never talked about before.  is it strange now to know that a lot of people are walking around with that personal knowledge of you?  any regrets?
in a way it seemed like you dwelled on your big losses more than your wins.
unless i'm mistaken, you and althea gibson are two of the best players ever to start off in their early days in harlem.  could you talk about althea gibson, about the ceremony last night.  your dad ever talk to you about her?
in the group last night there were so many.  were there one or two that stood out in the group for you?
why do you think it took so long for althea's memory to be honored?
how did the j block do today?
can you comment on amer delic?  what does he need to do to complete his game?
you're serving 5-3 second set and you spray two forehands.  what do you tell yourself then that pulls it together?
how does it feel?
was there a point when you were kind of counting to yourself and also wondering along with other people, am i ever going to win a match?
what keeps you going during that stretch?
some people wondered why you were playing some of the junior events.  you had a good result at wimbledon.  has that helped build your confidence coming into this part of the season?
it seems like you're more comfortable in yourself.  is anything you can pinpoint that's given you that feeling the last few months?
tonight venus and serena are going to be out there to honor althea gibson.  were serena and venus role models for you?  if so, how?
can you remember the first time you saw them one of them play, what your reaction was?
how old were you the first time you saw them?
obviously althea gibson played a long time ago.  are you pleased she's going to be honored tonight?  do you know anything about her?
do you know what you got on the biography?
you're already a young guy who has had a lot of expectations and answered a lot of questions, but can you imagine what it would be like to be andy murray and be the only guy after tim henman retires to be a young hope in your country?
speaking of that, that week you spent with them at davis cup came right before your first tournament.  looking back, was that a crucial time for you to spend time with those guys and have them give you confidence?
the crowd that was out there today, have you ever had anything like that before?  what was that like for you?
when you first started playing pro, what weren't you doing right?
this has to be one of your favorite moments in us open history.  before today, what was your most memorable moment here at the open?
besides that?
could you talk more about the wimbledon final, what it meant.
walking on the court today, did you have a different feel, a different confidence because of new haven?  was it different than any of your other two us opens?
talk about your mental approach on court.  even sometimes when it seems like you're playing well, you don't necessarily look happy.  are you pretty hard on yourself?
if i'm not mistaken, it was your father who coached you throughout the years.  can you talk about his influence on your life?
you are going to play richard gasquet next round.  any thought about it?
you came close with davydenko last week.  do you feel like you are ready to do something that people might not expect you to be capable of at this point?
have you played your last junior event?
not too many left-handers anymore.  there hasn't been a left-handed champion here in a while.  any thoughts on why that is?
can you talk about your experience with john mcenroe?
in the fourth set, somebody in the crowd was bothering you, something in the crowd?
you were talking to your dad?
when you see nadal hit his forehand like he does, do you think you'll be able to do that someday?
will a power game end up being important to you or do you think being quick, having touch is more important?
if i remember right, against davydenko, you were serving 4-2 in the third.  what was going through your head at that point?
can you explain or describe what it is like to return his serve?
what about his second serve?
do you think his consistency picked up with his forehand later in the match?
did you know much about him?  had you seen him on tv?
what did they say?
you've seen ivo, you've seen andy, wayne arthurs.  how does this compare to those three?
does it seem surprising to you?  he can spend four years in college and then suddenly come on tour like this and be this dominant?
when you see him moving on the baseline, because he's so tall, doesn't move quickly, do you think you should have moved him a little bit more?
he's never going to be as fast as nadal or coria or nieminen, but are you surprised how well he moves?
did you try any different preparation for this?
did that help?
the double-fault in the third set tiebreaker, did you just try to do too much?
must feel a lot better after that.
didn't really show any signs of nerves, but were there any before the game?
what pleased you most about your game?
in the third game, there was one particular big forehand winner.  you looked particularly pleased with that for obvious reasons.  can you remember what went through your mind when you hit that shot?
have you come across jonas much before?
we were all trying to find out who the chap in the sunglasses was who brad was chatting to.  is it right that it's the italian guy, the psychologist?
the bald guy sitting next to brad in the stands.
is it the psychologist?
is he here?
you're coming back to the big stages, and tim's retirement was announced obviously at this tournament.  i just wondered if you could address how you feel the impact of tim's retirement will be leaving you sort of alone, as it were?  i know you've had some practice being under the microscope, but do you expect a big up-tick in scrutiny and pressure?
you did seem very in control and at ease with yourself on the court today.
that's how it looked.  anything to do with the psychologist, work you've done with him, or is it a concentrated effort to internalize stuff?
is that something you thought about consciously, andy, during the summer while you haven't been playing much?
do you think in that context it will be a fascinating test against someone like bjorkman, making you play different shots, quicker shots as well?  interesting contrast.
why do you think you lost that enjoyment temporarily?
you had trouble physically in march at indian wells, then miami, then the wrist problem.  djokovic has taken that jump ahead of you.  you might have been considered to be about the same when you got hurt.  is t frustrating to see him go up like that, thinking that could have been you?
how significant is it to you to be playing center court, arthur ashe stadium, on a day althea gibson is going to be honored?
a lot of luck with your first-round opponent.  thoughts on having to face roger?
developmentally you couldn't ask for a more demanding environment.  what was that experience like?
did you feel like the crowd was kind of behind you?
how did that make you feel in such an environment, so many people?
you're playing a match before a ceremony to honor althea gibson.  do you have any thoughts on her, what she did for the sport, you playing in the wake of that?
roger has been described as the best ever.  is there something about what he does out there that's unlike anything you personally have ever encountered in tennis?
did you get a feeling when you're out there that there's a period where he's evaluating you, feeling you out, then comes a point where he exploits?
where is your game from last year at this time to this match?
your thoughts on the us open, the atmosphere here?
are you happy with the way you're playing?
what do you know about your next opponent?
strong way to open up your us open campaign.  comments on your match.
how would you assess your game this year relative to what it was last year at the us open?
the kid from florida, jesse levine, was talking about your time in dubai.
he said he had a good time.
said he went to lunch twice with you, but you didn't set him up at the seven-star hotel.
are there specific things you were looking to work on with him being a left-hander?
do you think it's good for you to have this kind of games, easy on the paper in the first round, or do you prefer more difficult?
what do you know about althea gibson?
she's being honored tonight.
after the story line at wimbledon, you're going for four here.  talk about that accomplishment, the desire to go for four consecutive.
when you were asked on court about the fact you've been no.1 longer than any other man, and you said, and steffi graf, got her, too.  was that a particular mark that you were after?
you also say your best friend on the tour is tim henman.  did you inspire from him?
when you invite to come hit with you and practice with you, are you just looking for a general workout, or are there very specific shots that you have in mind to work with with a certain player?
in dubai, if you invite someone to come hit with you.
what is useful about dubai as a place for you to practice?  is it weather related?
if you make it to the finals, have you invited tiger woods to join you?
tiger is in town tomorrow, in new york.  he hasn't made any indications he's coming to watch the match?
have you gotten any reassurances on hawk-eye since the disputed call at wimbledon?  are you happy?
in dubai levine was saying it was so hot you couldn't play till about 5 p.m.  is that pretty much your routine there?
5 to 9, then go to dinner?
could you talk to us a little bit about how much of a distraction these last few weeks have been, what they've been like for you, how you've been able to concentrate on tennis.
yes.
can you just talk about when you first heard about this, what your immediate reaction was.
what was the reaction of the other players in the locker room with you?
have you had a formal interview yet with the investigators?  where does that stand?
you haven't been interviewed or questioned by the atp, betfair, or anyone at this point?
the usta here at the us open have hired a private security firm to assist in monitoring players and also other people in case there might be some gambling infractions.  do you think this was a necessary step?  is there an issue in your mind with players being confronted by people?
does it bother you that they did hire a private firm to make sure there are no problems here at the us open as far as gambling goes?  does it bother you in some regard because of what has happened with you?
did you hear anything from the fans today on the court, comments, heckling?
why do you feel there was so much betting for you to lose in the match in poland?
it's become quite popular with some reporters in this country to suggest that there's a russian mafia somehow with its fingers in tennis.  do you feel personally insulted as a russian to think people are suggesting somehow the mafia is involved?
do you know which tournaments you will play after the us open?
the interview will be with the atp after the china event or the outside investigator?
will it be an atp official or an outside investigator?  do you know?
is it possible that other people knew how badly you were injured before that match?
how difficult is it to concentrate on your tennis with constant questions about that match, particularly coming into the us open?
have your teammates been supportive of you, other russian players, or have they not said anything?
are your davis cup teammates supportive of you?
50 titles.  is that significant for you?
half of them being grand slams and masters series, are you proud of that as well?
not to talk about the pete sampras grand slam record but, do you think about the overall singles titles, being 109?
is it just too far away?
how much do you think you've changed as a player this week going from your first match here to the last match?
how much pressure were you feeling in the first set on your second serve?  was really gunning those returns.
what about the last two service games, second serve aces to finish the match.
did you know there was that many swiss people in cincinnati signing autographs after the match?
are you feeling exactly where you want to be going into the us open?
earlier in the week you talked about trying to construct a schedule that would allow to you play until you're like 35.  how do you go about doing that?
where do you keep all these trophies?
how big is the trophy room?
display cabinet.
what do you hope to achieve outside tennis?
am i right in saying tomorrow you'll be no.1 for the same number of week as steffi graf, 186?
what does that mean to you?  pushed ahead to be the best ever, man or woman?
assuming you're in the no.1 until your 35, can you envision trying to fight to get into the top 20 like moya or agassi when he fell way back?  how is that going to be for you?
you said that in canada it seemed like he played the big points really well, and it seemed like today you and him both played the big points really well.  would you say that's true?
what is your feeling like after a match like that?  you obviously played pretty well and still ended up on the losing side.
how do you feel you handled the adversity?  the foot faults in the second set tiebreak, i think one was on his match point and one was on your set point.  you won both the those points.  you were able to sort of block that out.
did you think they're misreading?
what was missing today?  was it more mentally competence or was it tactics?
18 aces.
from an outsiders' point of view, looks like you were playing the best you've played in along time, and the most consistent.
11-0 against federer.  does that make you even more eager to beat him?
in your estimation, or mentally for you, how much of a difference is there in coming this close to beating him and actually beating him, you know, going forward confidence-wise?
looked like you've added a couple shots to your game recently.  you chip up the line more than i've seen before.
when was the last time you felt this good going into a grand slam?
can you contrast what's it's like when you and roger play like five years ago or even in the juniors?
what is your schedule next week?
there were no bloody knuckles today, but it was quite the fight, wouldn't you say?
in the third set, it looked like after you went a break down you became more aggressive and went for a few more shots.
nine.
but you served very well.
your 15-nil against the finalist, whoever that's going to be.  6-9 and whatever.  how do you feel going in?  obviously pretty good.
what does 50 mean to you?
i was talking about the titles.
you said that lleyton played very steady against you.  but do you also feel that he tries to take the initiative more against you these days than he used to?
how do you feel that he handled the adversity of the foot faults on some big points in the tiebreak?
you said you thought this was your best match here this week.  how difficult or not has it been to play here this week?
do you think after last weekend and the way you played today that lleyton becomes one of biggest challenges to your title in new york?
did you feel like he's back to somewhere close to his best, or has he always been around?
what were your feelings in the third set after you got the a break back and you had a couple more chances and i think two games on his serve?
where does this rank on the federer/hewitt top 20 since you've played twenty times?
he served 79% and you broke him five times.  were you feeling it out there?  seeing it really well?
you were really, really animated after that one point, especially after he missed that volley.  can you talk about what that was moment was like.
what's the balance like for you right now between the excitement from tonight and the anticipation about tomorrow?
watching you and nikolay have some of those rallies, you both hit very hit hard and flat and you both are really quick off the ground.  would you say that the biggest difference is that you're physically stronger out there?
have you watched roger at all this week?
he's been taking to three sets a couple times, and didn't look all that good in the final last week.  how do you think his game has been?
how much do you have to balance going for your shots against him and making errors, because he rarely beats himself?
you mentioned earlier trying to attack his second serve.  you played him a few times.  how easy is it to read the second serve of federer?
second straight night of really exciting match point.  talk about your emotion going through that.
you haven't had a chance to play roger this year or rafa or djokovic or roddick, any of the top four or five guys.  does that make tomorrow even more exciting for you since it's been a while?
how big has this week been for you?  ready to add an epilogue to the book yet?
you seemed like you had a lot of energy, especially that first set.  did you feel pretty fresh out there?
as well as you've been playing in the tournament, how important is it not just to get this win today but to keep going in this tournament?
carlos said you're a top 10 player, or on your way to being a top 10 player.  do you permit yourself to think of yourself in that sort of category again?
do you think people forget about you at big tournaments like this because you're not physically in the top 10?
but i guess that's all that matters to you.
but when you're not seeded that makes it tougher, too, doesn't it?
i guess you have a little bit of a unique perspective in that you're not currently a top 10 player, but it seems like you play with a confidence of a guy who's in the top 10.
because you were no.1 for so long, does that allow you to have that swagger even if you're no.20 in the world right now?  hey, i was once no.1, i can still beat these guys.
why is the body feeling good the last few months?
it was a back problem?
if on any given day you can beat anyone, and certainly you've proven that here in the past, where does federer come into this conversation?
is there any way to figure out a way to get an advantage against him?
what was the match like in canada?
next year the schedule around this time is pretty brutal with the olympics and not much time off between wimbledon and the masters series events.  do you have to plan in advance how you're going to work that schedule, assuming you're going to the olympics?
if it comes down having to chose between cincinnati and toronto is there any discernible difference as to why somebody would choose one over the other?
do you feel you did the job at least adequately today?
what about your serve?  75% seems like a really high number.
the third set you had a long stretch where you didn't miss a first serve.  are you proud you were able to hold on?
he's quite a flashy bird.
he has a really low ball toss.  how hard is it to read his serve?
are you feeling pretty confident tomorrow after ten in a row over lleyton?
of all the players left in this tournament lleyton is the only one who has defeated, and you that was in 2003.  how difficult do you think it's going to be for someone other than yourself to win this thing?
he thought last week it was going to be a little closer than the score indicates.
this is the second time you played him after he started working with tony, and you played marat safin after he started working with peter lundgren.  what are your feelings going into those matches with those guys who are coaching or working with your opponent?
when you're playing a tournament that's not a grand slam, do you ever have a goal or agenda in addition to winning, working on something in particular, experimenting?
have you seen much of peter lundgren around?  do you stay in touch?
what are your memories of lleyton from the junior days?  you played in the european championship.
you guys played doubles together at wimbledon?
you had twenty unforced errors the first set and nine the rest of the match.  what happened there?  did you calm down?  what changed?
considering how you came into it tournament taking it easy because of your stomach muscle, how odd does it seem to you that you're the furthest you've been in a masters series tournament since indian wells of '06?
did you change anything in the second or third set, or tell yourself anything to kind of stop making unforced errors?
and can you talk about match point?  he said it was probably one of the craziest things he's been part of.
when did you think about tonight's match being in solid out -- beyond sold out, center court, the crowd, you and sam going against each other.
how is your stomach feeling?
are you going stay and watch or are you outta here?
you came in here without any expectations.  how have they changed now?
how do you match matchup against davydenko?
what's the opinion on the davydenko gambling scandal?
was it a bit of getting out-retrieved on some of those points?  he seemed to get everything back.
how do you pick yourself up after a few poor weeks at this point?
no, but by your standards.
are you going reconsider whether you going to new haven next week or not?
looked like he got to every ball you hit.  was that frustrating?  you were hitting well and he chased everything down.
how comfortable or uncomfortable did you feel out there?  didn't look the roddick we've seen here?
are you going to have to hook up with jimmy sooner rather than later preparing through next week?
i would have thought so.
i would have thought, yeah.
you still had three set points in the first set.  maybe if you had made one of those i don't think we would be a having this conversation.
for so long you've been working on moving forward.  what makes it that you dropped back today?
there was a match before yours that went three sets.  a lot of the fans left and sort of trickled back in throughout your match, so you didn't have the full stadium that you usually have.  what effect did that have?
were you surprised that your forehand deserted you?  either hit stuff long or hit the tape, just wasn't really there.
you don't have now the momentum that you usually have after this tournament going into the open.  any thoughts there?
so for now, until james plays tonight, you're the last american in the quarterfinals.  do you feel you're carrying the flag, so to speak?
what has this run been like for you, this level of tournament?
how much does it raise your confidence level?
when you said that what you did in indianapolis was pretty big, bigger than the next week in vancouver, where does this compare?
are you turning some sort of corner at this point, do feel like?
is this like on some level a career-changing kind of moment?
do you seriously think about winning this thing?
does it seem at all remarkable to you that you're not all that far removed from a seven-match losing streak and things have changed pretty quickly and we're talking about you possibly winning a masters series tournament?
what's the difference between the losing streak and now?  playing the big points better?
assuming james wins tonight, talk about that matchup.
you talked about the confidence, but that would be a big boost as well, beating him.
if you play him tomorrow does that help?
what's it like right now knowing you can watch that match and you're already through and you're essentially watching your next opponent?
you going watch that?
you don't seem real overwhelmed to be playing a quarterfinal of a masters series event.  do you feel pretty even keeled?
who's here with you this week?
had they planned on -- i guess they wouldn't fly out if you hadn't won, or was that already planned?
have you talked with them yet?
you were playing on grandstand today opposite roddick, so there probably weren't a lot of people over there.  early on i counted and there was about 150.
can you sort of describe your emotion there on this match point.  it's not often that something ends like that.
how sure were you that that ball was in?
a lot of players try to hit to your backhand on the serve and you finished the match with a backhand return winner.  how does that feel?
you seemed to be in pretty good control until you got broken in the second and then you went down a break in the third.  what changed?
what happened to your game in 2005 and 2006, and how have you regained whatever it was that you lost this season?
a lot of people stereotype the spanish players as clay court specialists.  there are four of them still here, and you guys do pretty well on the hard court overall.  what, i guess, can you say about spanish players on the other surfaces?
what do you think is the secret to the spanish success?  there's eight guys in the top 50.  how do you see that happening in spain?  what's going on to help bring up the younger players?
you run around your backhand a lot.  is there any secret to how you practice?  because your footwork seems to be great.  you're always in position for the next shot even though you're always sort of trying to run around.  how do you do that?
how good of shape are you in physically compared to a few years ago?
12.
at this point in your career, what does it mean for you to play someone like lleyton hewitt, both of you former no.1s in the quarterfinals of a tournament like this?
looked like you were playing pretty well today and moving him around.  how did you feel out there today?
how can the weather affect you in heat like this?
you'll be glad to know that carlos moya had a tough three-setter today.  you play him tomorrow.  can you just talk about playing him again?
what do you make of his career?  he had a couple down years in '05 and '06, but certainly looks as good as he has in a while.
it's been a while, but what do you remember from the final here in 2002?
how have things changed for you tennis-wise since you got married and had a daughter from when you were single maybe and at the top of your game?
do you look at things differently now that you have a daughter?
how about off the court?
is your game as good now as it was a few years ago, or are you still going up or have you leveled off?
how have you felt so far in this tournament?  do you feel like you were playing the tennis that you wanted to today or were you just doing whatever you had to do to get through the heat and win the match?
quite a win for you, huh?
but those last two points, could you describe them, because they're both really pretty intense points.
it was luck?
did you feel like you were just faster than him out there today?
when you saved those three set points in the first set...
you've only been broken i think one time this tournament.  do you feel like your serving very well?
there are three spaniards in the quarterfinals so far and ferrero is playing tonight, and four spaniards last year made it to the quarterfinals.  is there anything special about spaniards playing in this tournament?
seems like a lot people think spanish players are really good on clay, but you guys have proven you're good on hard court as well.
do you think it helped you today that the weather was really hot?
how do you keep him on the baseline then?
you went from 0-9 against top 10 players now two weeks in a row.
how does ha feel?
seems like you always served well almost, but today you held your own on your groundstrokes.  did it seem that way to you?
in the first set, he rarely won any points on your serve until that game where he broke you and you still held your composure.  how did you do that?
staying mentally tough, he wasn't able to do that in the second set.  he had two breakpoints in the first game.
what about the finish, how you served out the match?
how soon after the match did you find out you would not be playing nadal?
okay.
4-1 in the second.
7-6.
when you said some little kid told you, was it right there on the court?
did you know the fans who were chanting for you, ace, ace, in your face?
when you talked about working on the mental part of the game, have you been working with a psychologist or something?
there's not a huge amount, as a matter of fact i don't know that there's anything on you in the atp book right now.  now, you chose not to go to college.  you chose to try your hand at this.  is this happening all faster than you thought?
you mentioned those fans.  how common has that been, that much support in a specific match?
how long do you think that people have really known who you are, sort of an up and coming american?
what kind of opportunities do you see in the next round?  is it a little different because you're not playing nadal?
did you watch novak last week at all?
you've played him before and been successful.
is there something about his game that suits you?
when you're at his level and just getting into the top 5 and playing late in the tournaments and having to go to a new tournament quickly, does it take time to get used that physically?
you mentioned it a little bit, but how much do you think that it helped you that he had a first round bye and you had a match coming into today's match?
when you were coming up, did you feel that same way that he does now about going deep in the tournaments then that first round of the next tournament is really, really tough.  did you struggle with that as well?
he has risen through the rankings so quickly.  besides today when he did not seem to play very well, how close is he to no.1 and no.2?
is he a reasonable favorite or maybe a second or third favorite for the us open?
did you say this was the best match you played this year?
did you play at the same level when you won this tournament over here?
how much does it change the way that players look at who can possibly win this tournament when a day like today happens when nadal and djokovic both go out?
how good does it feel to beat rafa?  even though he retired, you were playing very well.
how bad is your blister?
right or left foot?
the whole match you looked very confident and comfortable.  you were hitting winners and moving him around.  do you feel like you played one of your better matches today?
and the last time you played on hard courts was march?
is that normal for you, to go so long without playing hard?
obviously he was struggling a bit toward the end, but you seemed to be playing better today.
you had such a long day yesterday.  you've obviously recovered from the long match yesterday.
were you sore this morning?
you probably didn't want to win this way, but was it also nice to get a break given the you played almost three hours yesterday?
you looked to be coming into the net a lot today.  was that part of the strategy against him, or something you're trying to do more?
do you have any thoughts on the ongoing investigation involving davydenko and that match where a lot of money was placed against him poland?  i was wondering what was your thoughts on gambling and tennis in general.
were you surprised that happened?
some of french guys last week were saying that they had calls -- some of the doubles players -- that they had calls from people offering them money to throw matches.  have you heard of anything like that?
that's amazing.  in their hotels.
it's never happened to you?
is part of the reason you're coming forward more from working with tony?  is he suggesting that?
so many players seem to hit better passing shots on the run than they do straight out.
what about your prospective opponents?  you've played melzer.
what role does your family play in your tennis at this point in your career?
what was the problem?  it is blisters?
some players put pickle juice.
things have been going quite well for you recently.  how disappointed are you?
when did the problem start?  was it after canada?
do you feel any more pressure to play here since you didn't do so well last week?
you've also come back very well from elbow injuries and other problems.  we have a player, andy murray, who has injury problems and is fighting to come back.  can you describe how difficult it is to come back from a long injury and psychologically what it's like?
where did you get your mental strength from, friends or family or yourself?
despite the blister you probably still hit the shot of the tournament early in the match when you got the short ball and hit the forehand around the net.
describe that feeling.
did you feel out of sorts today?
when you say quite different, what do you mean?
are you still physically fatigued from montreal or has that passed?
do you think that as you continue at this level that eventually you'll get used to that kind of schedule?
it was said that the first round byes would take care of some of the fatigue from canada to here.  you lost today and nadal lost today.  how much do those byes really help?
moya obviously played well.  what was he doing well today?
do you think there's a future for these back-to-back masters series, like canada cincy, rome, hamburg, or has the game got to move to the situation where indian wells and miami is the model?
but it's possible to win these back-to-back masters series, right?
what if next year the schedule is so packed and you have to pick masters series tournaments to attend?
if you have to pick between canada and here, what would go into making that decision?
you mentioned that balls are flying.  how different are the courts here versus montreal?
the courts in new york, how would you classify them?
second set he saved two match points and forced a tiebreak.  did you feel like he was playing better, or did you feel like your game was slipping a little bit?
how important is this week do you think to just get the focus back on your tennis, the on-court stuff?
has it been harder to focus on tennis since what happened, or not really?
how hard was it last week to do that?
are you hopeful the investigation will be over soon so the people won't talk about it anymore and you'll be cleared?
when you look at today, six of the top seeds lost.  how does that open up the draw for the remaining guys like yourself?
how many days have you been able to practice?  when did you get here?
was that enough time, do you think, to get used to the courts?
how did you feel you played today then against ginepri?
be consistent.
how is the toe injury?  how is your toe?  does it feel better?
so do you have something in your shoe to keep the pressure off of it?
orthopedics?
as far as that investigation goes, is the atp giving you updates, or how are you communicating with them?
some of the top guys are falling like flies.  weren't you supposed to be the one coming in here banged up?
now it's juan carlos ferrero, the third time here, fourth time in your career.  what does he do so well against you?
speaking of the backhand, a lot of the players, notably federer and gonzo are going to the slice backhand more.  is this something that you would want to do with your game?
what affect is there upon players like yourself when other top seeded players throughout the bracket, like djokovic and nadal, lose on a day like today?  is there a feeling that the tournament has opened up at all?
how frequently are you assessing your physical health right now?  can you say you'll feel great for tomorrow's match?
given the success you had last year, the tournament wins and your ranking, i was wondering, how would you assess how this year has gone for you?
when you play someone like ferrero, carlos, is it your goal to end the points quickly?
i imagine it must be very difficult to play and lose to people that you probably stand a fair chance of beating, but do you feel in six days there's been an improvement over your previous tournaments?
why would it be that you weren't moving well?  was it a confidence thing?
do you still feel pain when you hit on the forehand side?
was anticipation part of problem on your return?  you're usually able to get a lot of breakpoints, but today...
how much has that surprised you that you haven't picked up that part of your game as quickly as maybe might be expected?
has it affected the way you construct points?
you have said the wrist is almost 100% in terms of pain-free.  sometimes when you opened up it looked good and then didn't open up on shots you might have on otherwise.  is it now mental rather than physical?
is it frustrating waiting for that process to happen, or do you feel comfortable knowing that's going to be a while?
how long did it take to you decide whether or not to play here after montreal?
what did brad say about it?  did he try to guide you in making your decision, or did he leave it up to you entirely?
so is the plan still to go to new haven next week?
do you stay here and practice for a bit?
are you writing off the us open?  is that just going to be another practicing experience because of the slow way it's coming back, or do you have some hopes?
you said recently that the results aren't important for now.  you're just working through the process.  must be quite hard to take, not so much today but last week, just mentally for your confidence.  or can you write them off?
can you tell, has it been difficult for brad and for jamie and the rest of them watching you as well?
pretty easy, huh?
the double faults i'm sure you wish you could take some of those back.
where are you with your game now?  are you satisfied?  how satisfied are you with where you are right now?
were you just relieved when you hit that volley winner and the match was over?
what were you thinking as you saw that opportunity for that winner on match point?
did you notice your shirt was similar to the linesmen's?
when you hit the ball out of the stadium, understandably excited, how excited were you?  this is an early round match when you look back on things.
how much does is that help you for the later rounds, surviving a third-set tiebreaker?
last week you were quite encouraged by some things and things seemed to be going right.  what happened?
and was it difficult to adjust to the speed of the court or anything like that?
do these kind of defeats make any difference to you?  with a match like this, can you just write it off as a bad day?
when you were younger were you ever a ball boy?
at the kremlin cup?
what are your memories of that?
did you do it one year or more?
do you remember the years by any chance?
do you have any memorable matches, any memorable experiences, players that you looked up to?
have you talked to jonas about that?
what does he think?
is it more disappointing or frustrating for you when you have a day like this when you can't seem to find your game?
you were playing better the second set.  did you feel like maybe you had a chance to get back in it?
where do go from here?
earlier in the summer you were talking about making a conscious effort to really go for it up to the us open.  how do you feel your game is overall?
are you feeling 100% now in terms of the injury?
earlier in your career do you think you would have been more upset by a loss like this?  because people know you a very emotional, passionate player.  like you said, this is not life or death, but do you think when you were younger you would have taken it harder than now?
i just meant is it different for you now because you're an older player?
i have a strange question:  have you started to wear shorts with no pockets?
so that's why you take the ball from --
doesn't that break your rhythm?
do you feel your knee any time after the match?
do you recuperate over the night?
am i right in saying that the us open is one of your favorite tournaments, if not your favorite?
but what are your realistic ambitions this year if you're thinking about next year being fully fit?
are you still enjoying playing?
when you were a ball boy did you work for rosset?
did you joke about that when he was coaching you?
no?
how tough has this year been for you after what you did last year and having to defend all these points?  is it tough going into each tournament having to think about defending points?
when you're preparing though, how much do you think about, or how aware are you that you need to maybe win these matches to gain those ranking points?
what was last year like for you, just the way you were playing and getting to no.3?
how close did today's match feel?  two tiebreakers.
you were down i guess 4-1 in the second and looked like you were out of it and then you made a comeback.  did you feel like at that point you had the momentum to come back?
it's been five years since you won a championship here.  do you still get the sense that people remember you from that year and you're still a pretty popular player in cincinnati?
you were in control in the second set until he broke you to get back in it.  what happened at that point?
i guess this is the highest you've been ranked in two years, coming of the win in croatia.  what about your game is going well right now?
are you looking to get back in the top 10 or compete in a tournament like this and win it?
how much pride do you have doing this at this stage in your career?  usually it's one way or the other at your age.
and you always believed that you would get back to this level?
who is your coach now?
when did you make that change?
before last year's us open?
what was his last name?
your story has been out there a lot, but in cincinnati a lot of people don't know your story when you left your country.  talk about that, how that's molded you into how you are now.
to get where you've gotten you've had to go through a lot.
you feel like it'll be really kind of -- i don't know rescue is the right term.
was italy, did they come to you and call you?
now that you've established yourself in your career and made a lot money, is it cool to take care of your parents?
do your parents still live in bosnia that?
you're dad had to stay back?
was he actually fighting?
basically escaped?
are you still on the player's council?
what do you like about that role?
you're not afraid to speak your mind either.
going back to home, i know you live in monaco.  do you have any connection to bosnia?
you look at bosnia as like the homeland?
you don't feel like you have to give back?
did you feel like that experience as a kid helped you make you, i don't know if tough is the right term, resilient?
you got off to a very fast start.  you didn't really let him back in the match very much.  talk about when you felt was going right today.
how are you feeling after the two surgeries?
how difficult is it to recover from an injury like that, mentally to trust yourself to hit properly?
is it hard to sort of allow yourself to trust the strength of your wrist?
what was it like when you first started practicing?
it was hard having to take a year off, being forced to take a year off?
you said you were happy winning in two sets.  what was it like?  obviously marat, when he's on, he's very, very good.  does this give you some confidence?
andy murray has a wrist problem and is coming back now.  last week he wasn't able to play the way he's used to.  is it possible to give anyone advice in a situation like this with a wrist injury?
that's what i was asking you about, what it's like when you can't fully trust it, when you're first hitting and you're not sure if it's going to stand up to play.
with yours was it almost immediately okay once you rested enough?
it's difficult to be that mentally strong.
having played five or six tournaments, where are you in terms of feeling like you can compete regularly and be successful?  i guess kind of like prior to your injury.
did you change the way you trained when you were injured because you knew you had to sit out and not play?  did you change anything in terms getting physically fit during the time off?
so did that help you?
so are you saying that your perspective on things has changed since you came back?
what is the name of the charity?
you raise money for?
did you feel at all that you gained a little bit of momentum for just a set out there today?
what's the season been like for you?  has it been pretty tough?
how did to feel today?
does the back come into play in the longer matches?
are you going to play in new haven?
have you asked yourself why even bother with the hard courts if it's that much pain?
how important is it to get a few matches under your belt in new haven before the open?
have you thought about how much longer you want to do this overall?
how have you thought about what you'd still like to achieve in your career?
can you talk about beyond this season?
you played isner.  comment on him, what you saw on him in washington.
what would you say made the difference in this match?
federer says yesterday in the conference you are in the driver's seat when it comes to clay, and not on grass.
being broken for 4-2 seemed to maybe just push your game down a bit.  what were you feeling at that time?
what about the knee, and the injury?
on one of the breakpoints in the fifth set, you had a backhand volley to the open court but you didn't hit it that hard.  was that the key shot?
what was your best opportunity?
federer has won so many grand slams now that some people are saying he could become the greatest player of all time.  how much would you agree with that?
do you feel now that your rivalry with roger has moved beyond questions of about preferred surface, and now there's only a few points separating you on any surface anywhere in the world?
today you looked very angry.  were you angry or just intense concentration?
yeah.  no smile, no light, nothing.
yes.  is the same.
you seemed to be playing a lot closer to the baseline in this match.  was that conscious?  was this a change of strategy to try to get to the net faster?
you must be very tired as well.  what is your preparation now for the hard court season?
you have america coming up.
right after the handshake at the net, the way you were sitting in your chair, you seemed very, very disappointed.  were there things going through your mind?  were you just exhausted?  did you feel the match got away from you?
when you were serving at love-2, 30-all in the fourth set, nadal hit a ball that was inches long.  you, carlos ramos, the umpire, and i saw the ball clearly long.  nadal challenged it, and the hawk-eye simulation showed the mark touching the line.  have you changed your mind as to whether hawk-eye is accurate since you told me last week that you think that it is?
i was struck by your comment after the match on court that you had to win these while you could.  do you really feel like rafael is breathing down your neck here and all over the circuit?
what do you think you'll remember most from this match?
you're going to leave out jack kramer?
you had to be happy with the way you served on big points.
how would you describe the meeting you had with bjorn borg after the game?
what was going through your mind at the very end and you collapsed?
you practiced with goran ivanisevic before the final.  he's a lefty.  does it help you against rafa?
you obviously enjoy playing with the legends of the game.  can you step back and compare the incredible moment in australia with rod and then meeting tiger last fall and then here today with borg?
you've played him four of the last six major finals.  pretty clear this is a rivalry.  do you like this, or do you prefer when it was safin one big match, roddick the next, hewitt, where you didn't know where you would play in the final?
you have achieved so much in your career.  what ambitions do you have left in tennis?
you're only three titles away from tying pete sampras.  does it seem to be getting more realistic?  you're a young guy.
i don't know how much you saw of bjorn borg's early career on video.
any similarities between your games?
when you were at 1-all, 15-40, 2-all, 15-40, in the final set, did you fear the match was slipping away from you?
you have swiss and south african nationality.  in 2003 you created a roger federer foundation to promote sports in south africa.  how is that progressing?
do you want them to play tennis or just school?
aside from the fact that it was your fifth and all the history, was it also special because you were tested so much?  you haven't been tested that much in most tournaments, and even in the finals here you'd never been to five sets.  did that make it that much sweeter, just the battle it took to win it?
this week you practiced a few times with a portuguese junior.  could you tell me a little bit about his game?
it the fourth set when you talked to the umpire, was that the closest you came to losing your temper since you were a kid?
do you have the same de'ja vu feeling last year, reaching the final with nadal?
how would you best describe why you're so successful versus everybody, including nadal, on grass, and he is so successful against everybody, including you, on clay?
but why the difference, you so much better on grass, including against him?
do you think rafael is much better on grass than he was one year ago?
bjorn borg saw you play today.  how much do you think about matching his five-in-a-row record?  how do you compare your achievements at wimbledon to his?
marion bartoli had james bond inspiring her yesterday.  do you think bjorn being there inspired you that little bit more today?
today in the press conference with bjorn borg he said if there's anybody to do five in a row, i want it to be roger because he's such a nice guy.  what kind of relationship do you have with bjorn today?
how conscious were you of gasquet's foot problems?  how much did you try to work him out?
this might put pressure on you, but borg was saying today he feels you're capable of winning wimbledon, three, four, five more times.  how do you react to that?
nadal said there were lots of players who were more complete than him, better than him, and at the end didn't give you trouble.  what does he have?  is it the mental, physical, the way he runs for every ball?
there's been a lot of talk about you being the favorite, reaching the final, winning for the fifth time.  what is the feeling like to be in the final again?
will you look towards the finals of the french or last year's final against nadal for how you might play tomorrow?
yes.
that's a very disappointing way for a grand slam challenge to end for you.
can you tell us exactly what the problem was.
were you able to hide your troubles away from rafa before the match?  did you come across each other in the locker room?
is it fair to say the weather helped to beat you as well as your opponents?
is it fair to say your fitness problems will go away with some rest?
when you won the first set, knowing how you felt, did you think you could win at that point?
what did he say to you at the end?
where is the injury?
you say in the foot.  but where in the foot?  how impedes you to move?
your efforts this week are likely to earn you a career-high ranking of 3.  what does that mean to you?
how did that one get away from you?
can you expand on that a little bit, talk about what happened in the match.
don't you feel you played a little bit too much on his backhand, especially going to the net?
what has been your practice with jimmy together after a loss?  does he typically look at a videotape of a match?  is there any breaking down, or do you just focus on what's ahead?
how do you think he's going to do against federer in the next round?
is this as hard a defeat to take as you've had recently?
he's been around the fringes.  he's blown some opportunities.  everyone always said he has a great game but hasn't pulled it together.  do you feel a little bit like wrong place, wrong time for you?
how does his backhand compare to the other great backhands you've faced?
you said this is definitely the hardest or maybe as hard a loss as you've had.  can you elaborate on why.  what were you feeling going in?
playing well the first two sets.  is there a point at all where the idea of playing a semifinal against federer here enters your mind at all?
are days like this the toughest part of being a professional athlete?
some people looked at the draw and said if he gets by youzhny, berdych won halle.  you must be feeling pretty good.
it's amazing considering the championship that you've had, you are the first player to get into the semifinals.
is it an advantage to be first in?
tomas said the wind out there was so bad it was almost impossible to play good tennis.
how important was it to win in three sets today?
you said yesterday you played your best three sets on grass.  do you think you played better today?
does it feel like a different centre court, the character of the court?
if it turns out that you make it to the finals, roger makes it to the finals, how different will the feeling be this year versus last year when you faced him?
you played on three different courts now.  if you have a choice for tomorrow, would you prefer to play on centre court or no.1?
roger doesn't give up too many sets on grass.  he gave one to juan carlos today.  does that surprise you?  how do you think you would have played had you not played for six days in a row?
two spaniards in the last eight.  what are the secrets?
do you think the difficulty you've had in getting through this draw might ultimately help you, make you sharper?
you've had two five-setters, one over five days.  you've rain, wind, lightning, thunder.  can anything stop you this year?
do you get nervous before your matches, before a semifinal in a grand slam?
what do you put your transformation down to in the third set?
were you aware of how marion was doing against justine henin?
it's a good day for france.
quite a turn from playing him in the first round to the semifinals.
you said you were disappointed last year.
what was on your mind when you finished the match?
what was your key to winning the third set?
can you beat roddick and federer back to back?
can you tell us how tired you feel now?
was it a draining, tiring day because you had to wait while there was a five-hour match before you?
you play 12:00 tomorrow.
can you tell us about the pressure you've gone through from being a child prodigy to getting into the semifinals of a grand slam now?
do you know marion?
if it's true that you're starting tomorrow at midday, do you...
do you think that's a bit unfair?
do you think people will start calling you a star rather than a prodigy now?
what's the key thing that makes your backhand so incredible?
when you sank to your knees at the end of the match, there must have been exhaustion as well as delight.
how is your fitness playing nadal tomorrow?
was it a back or hip problem?
what does it feel like to be part of probably the best match at wimbledon this year?
does playing two tough matches like that, might that prepare you for rafael nadal?
it's fitting you sang "i will survive" in that karaoke.
does that have any sort of meaning?
no one's asked you to record it professionally?
do you ever step back and say, this is a nice surprise?  what have been the one or two things that have allowed you to have this incredible run?
you trained at a mountain.
which mountain was that?
do you feel that's helped with your stamina?
is it true you've already learned seeing what nadal is doing in practice, the work he does physically?
the work he does, that you've learned from him as well.
semifinal in the french and here.  do you think you're ready to win a grand slam?
same stage of a grand slam, same opponents.  playing against nadal, what will be different this time, the strategy?
two things:  in the fourth set when you broke, got broken back, you seemed to lose your spirit.  i don't know if that was the injury or what happened, but it took a few games until your really got your spirit back.  and second, your footing, you had problems on the baseline.  was that the condition of the court or your shoes?
is it right you do an impersonation of rafa?  any chance you might do it tomorrow?
good opportunity for you coming in.  conditions have a big impact on your game, your mentality today?
does that make it a bigger achievement to win wimbledon, or does it make it a lesser achievement, that you have to deal with all the conditions?  does it take anything away from the guy who wins or add something to him?
you stayed with him in the first set.  afterwards it fell away.  what happened?
do you think he can stop federer?
after the era of borg, it seemed to be players who were very good on clay were not so good on grass.  how good is nadal on grass?
do you think he has special talents that make him different from other players?
rafa said yesterday he pinpointed the serve as key to performing well on grass.  did you notice anything different with his serve?  has it improved?
how bad was it out there?  what did it feel like with the weather?
is that the windiest conditions you've played in ever?
the topspin play of rafael was hurting you so much because of the wind?
rafa's second serves, he was serving a hundred miles.  topspin seemed to hurt you.
do you have to change your routine between points because nadal has such a long preparation to serve?
you've had a good couple of weeks.  what does it mean going for you into the hard court season?  you're going to play a full schedule?
can you sum up your feelings after that match?
how is your shoulder?
you appeared to keep resting it against the wall.
were you aware of how excited the crowd were?  it's the best match we've seen at wimbledon this year.
how about your fans?
there must be some consolation to you how well you played, coming back from two sets down?
you lost to a very special player.  not many people who would have beaten you in a match like this.  can you say something about how you see novak, and if he has a chance of going further?
you were smiling for a lot of the match.  people were saying it was a great sporting occasion.  it was a gentlemanly game.
word about your supporters?
do you know how they get tickets?
do they queue every day?
there's a word of george michael coming.
he was in the crowd.  did you know that?
were you aware the police had to calm them down at one point?
are you quite friendly with djokovic?
what makes him so difficult to play against?
amazing record in tiebreaks.
do you think it's a shame he's got to play tomorrow without any time to rest?
who do you think will win between him and nadal?
if you are advising rafa about how to play him now, what would you say?
can we ask you what happened to your back?
it changed a lot, the match, after you got injured.  is it mental or physical?
it was a serious thing?
what is the injury?
how do you feel about nadal's chances in the coming matches?  he's playing every day.
after the second set, your standard of tennis dropped quickly.  was there a point or particular movement that suddenly hurt your back?
did you think you had any chance to win once the pain set in?
do you think it was more who went down or him coming up?  to talk with him, he didn't know how much you were injured.
you've beaten him twice this year.  you were dominating the two sets.  were you thinking you were the better player today with no injury?
is your back something you will be able to fix, or is it always going to be a problem?
are you very disappointed because of this injury?  do you think if you didn't have the injury you would have won, or you don't think about that?
you seemed to be enjoying it till the last game.
you seemed to be enjoying the atmosphere even right at the end.
seems like you have more confidence in your backhand than forehand.  is that true?
same?
when you were two sets down, did you have any feelings you would be going home to majorca tomorrow?
now that you have defeated youzhny, who was one of only three players to have beaten you twice in the last 12 months, does this success today mean now it's easier to beat fed express and berdych?
are you concerned about playing one match every day between now and the finals, particularly because today was a five-set match?
every player protests sometimes after the scheduling.  if you were the person who has to make the schedule on saturday, two semifinals, one women's final, what would you say before?  how would you make the schedule?
on saturday.  saturday is two men's semifinals and one women's final.
saturday, for sure.  if you finish the tournament on sunday, you have to play two semifinals on saturday.
at the start of the third set you suddenly found your game really well.  did anything change?  did you try something different?  what suddenly started it?
you said you played better today on grass than you've ever played before.  do you think you played better today than last year against federer?
he seemed to have a back injury.  did that change the way you played in the third set?
many people say federer has a massive advantage because of the rain delays.  do you find now maybe that is the case, or do you still feel motivated to give it a good go?  if so, would it be your biggest achievement to even get there?
tomas berdych said he feels grass gives him a slight advantage over you.  what are your feelings on that?
do you feel you made a little bit of a breakthrough today in your mind about playing on grass?  do you feel more confident now after the way you were able to express yourself today?
but you feel better about yourself and grass today?
how did it feel to be playing on court 2?
you must be disappointed not to have taken that match into a fifth set?
do you think you could have done any more today?
other than that, were you happy with your performance?
how big were those set points in the first set tiebreaker?
you probably don't feel too well-disposed for hawk-eye after that match.  two crucial matches, tight calls went against you.
your opponent had some treatment.  were you aware of him slowing down, being affected in any way by his injury?
do you ever think there's some sort of gamesmanship about having treatment after a set has been dropped?
can you assess the difference between the djokovic you beat at the us open last year in straight sets and the one you played today?
can you see anything in the way djokovic plays, retrieves everything, similar build to yourself, isn't he?
are you impressed with how he handles the pressure of tiebreaks?
when you went down in the tiebreak, 0-4 point, did you hurt yourself?
what's the lead-up for you to the us open?
you played some good tennis here and at the french open.  how important is it to you to appoint a new coach, or are you pretty comfortable with how things are at the moment?
it's a great resource, isn't it?  do you feel like you're at the stage of your career where you necessarily need one voice as a coach all the time, or are you happy taking advice here and there from people you trust?
there's been a bit of speculation about you teaming up with tony roche.  do you have any plans to talk to him?
on djokovic's performance today, can you see him going all the way to the final on sunday, particularly in view of the fact he's going to have to play another three successive matches?
baghdatis.
looking back to this time last year, lot of big changes in your life:  got married; had a baby.  do you feel like now you're back sort of in more balance in terms of personal life, professional life, or...
how much upside is there to your game at the moment going towards the end of the year?
happy with those stats?
very tough match, though, today.  very physically testing for you.
you were doing a lot of slipping out there.  was there a lack of traction on your sneakers?  do you have another pair?
so you didn't have an extra pair with you?
did you injure yourself?  did that cause the injury to your back?
could you have played in a fifth set?
were you in discomfort because of the injury?
lleyton was asked about the difference between here and the last time you played in new york.  he said he felt you had all the shots then but you weren't trying very hard.  he felt like you were fighting it out more.  is that a fair comment?
how much did the rain delay slow your momentum?
you've had some pretty memorable experiences already this year.  in terms of the prospect of playing a quarterfinal, a semifinal, and maybe a final in successive days, do you think you're in good enough shape to contend for that?
we were watching so many different matches this morning.  so much was going on.  but it didn't look like you wanted to attack very much.  at times it seemed like you attacked even more on clay or hard courts earlier in the u.s. this year than you did today.  was that to prove a point that you could beat him from the baseline?
in the best-case scenario, saturday will have two men's semifinals and a women's final.  if you were doing the schedule, how would you organize that?  would you have the men playing at the same time or one after another?
do you enjoy the pressure of a tiebreak situation?
you were clearly very unhappy in the third set with the call from the umpire.  what happened?
have you had some history with that umpire?  you said it happens quite a lot with him.
is it just umpires in general?
do you think hawk-eye, or possibly the bigger courts, would help that?
is that frustrating in a big match like this?
what does he have to do well to trouble nadal?
do you think the brief rain break affected you in the fourth set?
i notice you didn't shake the umpire's hand.  is that the first time?
were you surprised to see how bjorkman reacted at the umpire in the third set?
with all the success you've had here, long and frustrating tournament with all the delays, are you planning to take the next week off, or will you be still be playing in bastad?
can you tell us about your next match.  it will be a tough one, isn't it?
you must be quite confident.  he's had stop and start matches previous.  today he was struggling before youzhny had his injury problems.  you must fancy your chances?
are you confident you can reach the final?  i know it's a big ask.
can you tell us about your wimbledon, where you've been stopping, going out?  are you able to walk around wimbledon and do your own thing without being hassled?
away from the tennis.
where have you been stopping?  in wimbledon?  london?
are you able to go out in chelsea without being recognized?
you must like that.
rafa told us the other day he tried to ease the relationship between you both.  are things going better between you both?
is it true he went to talk to you, congratulate you for your title in halle?
you're one of the few people that have a positive record against nadal, 3-2.  do you think you have an advantage going into this match?
do you feel the emotions you have in the past between you are going to play an important role in this match?
what was the key to the victory?
how hard is it to hit a winner against him, because he's very fast and steady?
you have some great fans.
do they follow you everywhere?
does it boost your game?
do you know some of them?
of victories like this or a guy like davydenko, how much of the victory is more mental than physical and technical for you?
who do you think the steadiest player is?
now that you've got through, do you think the fans will be in the next game?
you'll have loads more coming out?
you had the breakout a year and a half or so.  are you still surprised at how successful you've been, or do you expect more out of yourself?
because?
what have you done to put yourself in this point where you are playing well again?
you're a guy who seems to get a lot of joy out of the sport.  have you found it's also very much of a job?
rafa, moya and yourself are all from mediterranean islands.  what makes it so special?
what part of the food?
in cypress, tennis must have come on a lot.
the shirts your fans were wearing, were they cypriot shirts?
can you picture on sunday marcos baghdatis holding up the winner's trophy?
you're feeling that good about yourself now where your game is at the level?
talk about either djokovic or hewitt.
has this wimbledon been tough with the weather for you?
do you like the grass?
how tough was that match?
what is the source of your bad blood with nadal?
rafa has been quite critical of you, your sportsmanship.  your thoughts on that?
he was quite critical of your behavior.
did you miss understand my question?  i asked what was the source of your bad blood with nadal?  why was it such an unfriendly match?
why don't you seem to like him as a person and as a fellow competitor?
rafael is saying that he tried to say hello to you.  you never answer.  try to shake hands with you.  you almost did not want to.  almost nobody in the locker room is speaking good about you.
you were imitating him out there on the court.  it seemed like you were making fun of him.  you were delaying a little bit, sometimes stepping back.  it seemed pretty obvious there was something going on.  what rafa said seemed to confirm that.
he was also complaining the ball hit the net, went over, not doing the courtesy wave, the handshake.
how would you describe how you feel about him and what your relationship is?
stopping and starting the match the day before and today, do you lose a lot of mental stamina because of that, or do you feel you have more energy and umph to move forward and win?
do you think rafa has the game to stop roger federer taking a fifth title?
were you upset you weren't playing on sunday?
after the match was called off, we had one hour of sun.
which things were feeling uncomfortable to you in the court?
you were feeling uncomfortable in the court, not easy on the court.
in general, how difficult is it to be on the court, go back again to the locker room?
did the tension cripple the match in that respect?
would you tell us what you were thinking when you were grabbing at your shorts and why you were doing that?
how did it make you feel during those 200 times he did slow things down?
can you go over that rather amazing tiebreak with us.
talk about the whole ordeal of the rain, on and off.  rafa was talking about why we didn't play on sunday.  can you talk about how you deal with that, what you thought.
could it get to the point with roger not playing so many days - people have been talking about it as an advantage - but that it could be something of a liability for him?
how would you feel about that much inactivity for your own game on a surface like this?
would you not lose momentum that way?
what was the loopiest thing that happened in the locker room?
or not for a profitable book.
during the rain delay, who's the most fun to be around?
how does gimel compare as a talker with brad?
you have a tough match ahead of you, but possibly roger the round after that.  any lingering effects from australia?  do you think about that match, or do you take anything positive out of it?
there are a lot of quotes floating around from pete sampras the last few days talking about the lack of attack tennis at wimbledon.  he wanted his opponents to stay back.  you seem to be trying to get to the net more.  do you agree with him that's the way to win?
on your match, given the quality of the opponent today, you had essentially one bad service game.  is this your best tennis of the tournament?
what about the way you came out at the start of this to wrap up the second set?
the next match against gasquet or tsonga.  you know them well.
the brazilian team, 28-26, they said you congratulated them or something.  could you believe that score?  have you ever seen a match like that?
have you found yourself making significant adjustments on grass, or is it just tweaking a little bit, coming in a little bit more?
you're coming up on 25 in a couple months.  a lot of people call that the midpoint of your career - not if your jimmy connors.  where are you at this point in your career if it's sort of the midpoint?
25, mid-career.
but assess your career at this point.  how do you feel about it?
after the nadal/soderling match, soderling raised and issue about nadal's delaying tactics.  what is nadal's reputation as far as the pace of his play, and does it ever get to you when you play him?
after so many wins in a tiebreak, so many tiebreakers won consecutively, would you like more to have a fifth set always with a tiebreaker in all slams, like it is at the us open, or do you like better a long final set?
who is the person that you look up to, whether you follow their steps in the past or now?
sporting heroes.
in tennis?
didn't your expectations change once you accomplished two of the four?  sort of the natural thing, you win the open, become no.1.
no.  you can prop yourself and say, i did these two things and then figured maybe i can win australia, maybe two wimbledons.
you've been with jimmy at four majors now.  is he different at the different majors?  if so, how?
if this wimbledon goes into a third week because of the rain, are you available?  does it cause you any problems?
do you believe organizers have done enough to get the tournament back on track after all the delays?
if there's a monday final, you'll definitely stay here and play, you won't go home?
being the youngest player left in the draw, having won this match today from the only player who took a set off federer in 2005, what are your chances of winning this championship?
the rain is a very unfortunate thing that nobody can control.  you now face the possibility of playing six consecutive days.  in your mind, are you satisfied the tournament has handled the scheduling of the players properly?
what makes tipsarevic such a special guy?
he caused quite a stir here at wimbledon.  do you think you'd have had more games on the show courts if you had an eyebrow stud and tattoos up your arm?
a lot of players seem terrified suggesting they can even beat federer.  from what i've read, you seem to have the attitude you believe you can.  you're not frightened to say it.
have you spoken to anyone or asked anybody why it rains so much here or made any inquiries?
he enjoyed your bits of karaoke in france.  are you thinking of launching any singing career, any karaoke bars in london?
we were talking about john mcenroe helping you out around the net.  what is the status on that?
have you ever been involved in a situation where you had to wait so long to play and finish your match?
did you count how many times you went on and off?
have you looked ahead how it might work out for the rest of the week if the weather improves?
where does this rank in your many, many matches against argentines in the past?  how satisfying is this one?
if you were ever in a situation like nadal is currently in where he hasn't finished his third-round match, if the weather wouldn't clear, would you ever consider finishing a match and starting another one in the same day?
were you surprised you were second on court today rather than first?
when you're facing a breakpoint when the rain comes, how do you deal with that situation?  in the locker room, if you stay keyed up you can almost fry yourself.
seriously, it would be hard.
when you've had so many stops and starts, how important is it to have a warmup?  is it essential to have that five minutes?
does this stop and start really bring out the best in you?  what do you think?
are you satisfied with yourself with your game so far?
how do you rate your title chances?
you know what it takes to go all the way here.  do you get any of those feelings?
what were you actually doing in these off periods?  were you sitting around watching a dvd or reading a book?
you don't try to take your thoughts away from it?
what about practice?  outdoors or inside?
your family has been a big part of your career.  your parents aren't here.  how much contact have you had with them back in australia?
are they still offering you any advice?
are you primarily working with darren cahill still?
if you made it through to another final, say you met roger, do you feel you're in the sort of form you could trouble roger?
you're quite happy with the way you're playing?
your thoughts on that match?  how disappointing?
why didn't you play normal?
it's unlike you because you are known for always fighting back.  most of your matches are five sets.  why do you think that was today?
what do you do during all of these rain breaks?  how do you handle that?
what do you typically do?
when you're waiting.
reading?  listening to music?  talking?  playing cards?  what do you like to do?
do you think it would make sense to have a middle sunday?
did it surprise you?
it's tough on the players, isn't it?
what would be your plan for the rest of the summer?  which tournaments do you think you'll play?
what will you do from now until l.a.?
tell us about your situation.
did they do an mri on the injury?
is there a preliminary estimate of how long you're going to be out?
do you think sometimes you're kind of cursed?
is this the worst disappointment you've had?
you obviously did it during the match against dimitry.
was it a stretch or something?
nothing before that match?
do you think there's some sort of curse here at wimbledon on tommy haas?
the one where you twisted your ankle, you stood on a tennis ball?
is there any funny side to it?
can you tell us the tactic you were going to have against roger, a strategy you had in mind this time, a special way to beat roger?
if you were a player in the bottom half of the draw, hearing what's happened today, would you think, i mean, this guy can't be beaten here?  it's his championship?  he's played his matches, got one round ahead of most people, now his opponent can't play in this round, best player in the world on grass.  is it almost a gimme?
you have an attacking backhand.  so does richard gasquet.  gasquet has beaten him on a hard court.  is that one of the essentials you have to have in order to have a shot at beating federer?
did you say you have a winning record on centre court?
could you tell us what matches you played?
how will you describe your game so far?  pretty happy?
you obviously had great results here last year.  did that in some ways put a bit of pressure on you inside?
you needed that kind of reassurance that it wasn't a fluke?
did you expect to win quite as comfortably today?  david is not involved in many three-setters, is he?
david was talking about how good the weather was yesterday and saying how all the players would like a middle sunday, how it made sense.  do you go along with that?
will that be too much for you?
have you looked ahead, seen yourself in semifinals or finals?
why do you think your game translates well to grass?
do you get enjoyment from playing on it?  do you actually like it?
can you just expand why?  is it being able to be more aggressive?
when was the first time you played on grass?
both.
and soccer?
are you aware at all of the increased security?  can you sense that?
you had to walk a little bit further than normal?
are you aware of a few of the players that have had property stolen at wimbledon, other tournaments?
not heard anything?
have you been watching the serena match.  she was cramping on court.
you had a cramping experience at the open last year.  can you talk about how you manage that, how difficult it is, what you can do?
even though the rain is annoying, maybe you wished for some back then?
looks like your next opponent is going to be davydenko.  if it turns out that way, what are your thoughts?  what is the key playing such a good defensive player?
him being such a shot-maker, is there a risk you can become too frustrated, get bored into losing?
what is nikolay like off the court?  fun guy?  any good jokes, that sort of thing?
never spoken to him?
never had the occasion?
is there any one or two players out there that put some kind of fear in you?
funny?
you had a great result last year, but not a lot of talk about you coming into the tournament.  do you feel disrespected at all?
is everything a bit quieter this year?  less of a surprise to see you in the fourth round?
do you consider yourself a momentum player?
somebody who gets momentum as you win every match, hotter and hotter as you go along.
do you feel differently to the way you felt last year?  calmer perhaps?  more comfortable here?
when you're not playing, what do you do to relax?
what do you cook?
what is your favorite thing to do during rain delays?
talking about what?
were you aware you were down match point?
how do you explain last year you kept playing challenger tournaments?  you won four of them.
i've been in belgrade, but i cannot remember a grass court there.
some radiation from?
the two girls, they are younger than you.  you were the first one to make it when you won the australian juniors.
centre court fell in love with you today.  i don't know if you've realized they nicknamed you tipsy.  were you aware of their support and you are the modern face of tennis with your piercings?
at times you were dictating the points.  could this be your lucky racquet with the red strings?
you were pushing him back to the baseline most of the time.
you were blonde once.  you were a bit crazy.  that didn't help you when you went from the juniors to the pro.  you mentioned difficulties in yugoslavia,  former yugoslavia.  how could your family help you to play since the money was not probably that much?  castellani was a coach of yours.  why did you leave him?
a lot of people will have seen your tattoo.  i understand it says, "beauty will save the world."  what are you trying to say with that quote?
is that one quotation?
were you there during the bombing?
you talked yesterday about playing this match with nothing to lose, and yet it looked like until the third set, and when you really let the ball fly, you just played freely.  it didn't look like you were playing with nothing to lose until then.
on that crazy point at the end of the second set where the ball seemed to die in front of you as you tried to hit an inside out forehand, what happened there?
did you misjudge where it was going to bounce?
in the tiebreak, you played a great tiebreak, almost no balls were coming back, and then that very casual volley at a key point.  did you play that one just too casually?
if you had played the first set the way you played the third one --
-- could it have been a different set, match?
do you think anyone can beat him this year?
could you tell that he was uptight with you at the beginning?
how inspired were you to play against roger?  i mean, you've had some fantastic matches in the past.  is it more fun to play a match like that today?
where are you in terms of your relationship with grass?
let me move to your best surface, hard court.  how many us open series tournaments do you plan on playing?
there are six tournaments in the us open series leading up to the us open.
you'll still be in cincinnati, canada.  anywhere else?
do you wish that you'd come to this understanding of grass earlier in your career?
but in 1992 here, hewitt won.
yeah, sorry.  that would have been a year maybe you would have had a good chance if you were happier on grass?
will you ever be a top ten player again?
you still don't like wimbledon; maybe you said it's very expensive in london.
another 7-6.  i'm sure you're aware you're winning a lot of tiebreaks.  just the way it's falling?  are you playing them differently?
has jimmy had some input on how to play tiebreakers?
you must have been really happy to pull that third set out.
paul-henri mathieu.  once as a pro, once as a junior.
have you always had sort of the warrior mentality since you've been a kid where you want to go out and get at it, doesn't matter what the match is, you relish the fight?
you followed tennis for a long time.  looking at some of the exchamps, that's one thing that separates the good players from the pack, guys that really like the fight.
you got on just after james lost.
juan carlos, former no.1.  you played him a ton.  french open champ.  is that a match that james should win on grass now?
in terms of your fighting spirit, where did that come from?  was it being the younger brother?  watching other sports?
is that the thing you're most proud of in your entire career?
going through your teenage years with mardy fish, martins, how much did that contribute to the fire?
it's already got to be in the players in the first place.
do you ever compete with the other guys on the tour in other sports like golf?  ever challenge rafa to a game of golf?
any other sports you challenge the guys at?
off the court, have you done any competitions with connors?  he was pretty fiery.  cards?
what is your card game of choice?
the jimmy connors we all sort of know and love going ballistic...
do you think he's changed as a person since his playing days?
you talked earlier in the tournament you're going to have to probably go through roger to get a win here.  notwithstanding the french open, do you feel with the losses to caas, volandri, is there a sense he's a little more vulnerable maybe than a few months ago?
did you realize the miles per hour of his serve today was 124 to 142?
all the buildup for the french and wimbledon has been federer, nadal.  do you think this is an inspiration for good players like yourself to show there are more than two players in the world?
do you believe you do have a shot?
roger, that was quite straightforward?
you played really well.  how much credit do you give the fact that you're playing a guy like marat who is such a high quality player?
when someone plays you on grass or wherever, they know it's going to be tough, but it's equally as tough just to get a set off you.  it must be quite intimidating for players; are you aware of that, that you rarely even lose a set here?
did you feel really, really confident on your serve?  you seemed to serve well throughout, but right at the end of the first set and the first couple points in the tiebreak did you have a really good feel on your serve?
i remember reading a quote when you were saying that a long time ago you had to choose between two ways, which way to approach your career, a talented way, kind of laid back and easygoing and enjoying life, and the second one is hard-working way, you know, total commitment, and you chose the second one.  do you think in marat's case, for example, he's obviously a very talented guy and he won two grand slams, of course, but he would be the one who would choose probably not the way you've chosen?
do you think everyone can change that?  you said, "i changed that."  it's like, easy?
did you talk to pete at all about that exact subject when you had those hitting sessions with him in march, about making that commitment from earlier in your career when you were not doing so well?
with all the success that you've had, can you still get a kick in a way that do you feel a normal player would out of playing a great match and the adulation of the crowd and so on, or does it just wash over you now because you're so used to it?
how far in the match do you begin to calm down?  does it take you the first game, the first minute?
we've seen some wear sunglasses.  any chance nike might add a pair to your outfit?
when you're asking yourself all those questions, you know, tough questions, what i'm here for, i mean, how hard can i push myself or whatever, what am i striving for, what would you look to to help you find the right answers?  it can't be just you and yourself.  you have to have --
are you enjoying your first experience of wimbledon this week?
your serve is especially a great weapon.  what was the fastest serve you've registered this week?  did you notice?
if it is henman that you play next, will you enjoy having all the attention on that match and the support that henman will get?
you haven't played him before, have you?
what was your reaction when you discovered that you had a wildcard into wimbledon?
yes.
a little surprised maybe?
could you tell us, because surbiton and queen's you were going back and forth to play, what was that like?
you've had some injuries.
can you tell us what those injuries have been and how long you've been out, how you recovered?
you're perfectly okay now?
you showed at queen's when you beat hewitt you're capable of beating the world's top players on grass.  against henman, you'll be confident of the same outcome in that game?
are you in the best form of your life, would you say, at the moment?
when you saw the draw, you must have thought you may well get some british opposition because you could have murray.
have you been prepared since the draw was made thinking you may have to play against the local favorite?
grass has historically not been your best surface, but you have played roger very tough on grass, and you beat him before.  nobody quite knows which marat safin will be there to play federer in the next round.
when you were serving at 2-3 in the third set today, up 40-15, he hit a ball that was clearly long.  the baselines-woman failed to call it out, and the umpire, refused your request to overrule.  do you think this hawk-eye system is any more accurate than these lines-people?
do you think hawk-eye is accurate?
do you think it's accurate?
you complained about the prices of the food at wimbledon.  what about the standard of the food that players are served?  should they be given more international cuisine?
what is the quality like?
you mentioned it's important for you to keep your focus against federer.  is that a struggle for you in every match, keeping focus?
do you bring your own sandwiches?
can you talk about your opponent today?  how do you think he played?
you mentioned after your first match you weren't very confident.  what degree of confidence do you need going into a match against federer?
where is your level of confidence now?
what do you like most about wimbledon and what do you dislike most about wimbledon, apart from the prices?
and dislike?
you faced a lot of breakpoints in these first two matches, but you've also defended almost every one of them.  are you concerned you're facing so many breakpoints or how feeling good you defended so many of them?
how well do you think you played today?
if you compare the speed of the court with last year, do you think it's similar, faster, slower?
i understand you baked a cake for your friend on monday.  are you a good cook?
do you have any other talents apart from tennis?
what do you know about your next opponent?
you have only met him on clay?
safin has to play federer in the next round.  how do you think he's going to do?
is there any other player here you think can beat federer on grass, apart from yourself?
lpez did very good today.  do you discuss tennis together before a match as friends?
how is your mind working when you play an opponent who you beat on clay and now you meet him here on grass?
so you have no advantage here with your wins on clay?
how will you look back on this year's wimbledon experience for you?
you never gave up.  did you feel you could actually go on and win?
did you feel that you turned off a little bit at the start of the fifth?
did he get under your skin?
did he get under your skin with something he did out there?
what was the gesture you made when you let the ball go long?
do you expect to be back here next year?
what were your own expectations from this year's wimbledon?
are there any other sportsmen that you look at in terms of inspiration in terms of going on?
you obviously have to look at yourself.  does it depress you you're the last british player out of the singles, only on thursday afternoon?
do you believe some of your british players realize the storm that's coming?
on the last breakpoint when the ball floated over your head, was it sort of a terrible feeling?
did you have a play on it?
is henman hill still going to stay henman hill now?
did you have something to prove to yourself or anybody else coming in?
did you achieve what you wanted?
did the moya performance convince you to go on longer?
how would you assess your relationship with your fans?
how are you going to replace that feeling that you get on centre court when the time comes?
are you ready for the long haul here in the sense it's going to be one of those wimbledons over the next few days on and off, the disruption?
how do you define or view "excellence"?
how close have you come to playing the perfect fill-in-the-blanks game, set, match?
i don't know if you're aware of this but there's a church in wimbledon village that has put up a billboard that said, "god made roger federer."  i wondered if you considered that good free advertising?
you were just speaking about perfection.  tennis is a fabulous game.  if you could improve it, how would you do that?
my question was actually on the sport of tennis, on how you would improve the sport.
are you religious?
are you going out to the church to have a look?
have you been in contact with tiger woods recently?  have you had the chance to discuss his fatherhood?
what has been the context of the conversation?  has he shared anything at all about how his life has changed?
is that quick enough for you out there today?  is there any awkwardness at all?  obviously you had quite a sizable lead when you stopped yesterday, but coming back out in the middle, resuming a match.
do you subscribe to the theory or stereotype that certain regions or certain countries produce certain types of players:  topspin forehands from spain, or flatter strokes from czechoslovakia, maybe switzerland, a blend of cultures and languages, they're more versatile.  what do you think about that?
do you go any deeper than that, like the psyche of where you come from?
djokovic the other day said he was surprised how slow centre court was playing.  can you assess centre court versus court no.1?  what adjustments are you making from the french open to wimbledon regarding the string tension?  and do you have a cold?  you sound a little bit different.
how much?
a lot of commentators picked up in the buildup to this that you dropped halle as a warmup tournament.  now that you've got a bit of perspective after four days here, has it changed the way you've come into this tournament?  does it feel different or are you back into the swing of things?
what do you expect from marat?
a lot of players seem to be doing more modeling, the men taking more fashion, pride in their fashion.  have you noticed that?  obviously with your white outfit, what is your take on all of that?
are you aware of the stories there have been a lot of items stolen from the locker rooms?  are you aware or concerned about it?
you said the court the other day was pretty slow.  how would you assess the court you played on today?
what do you foresee for the tournament, your next opponent?
semifinalist here.
if you had your life on the line in a tennis match, who would you pick to play that match for you, nadal or federer?
pretty much took care of business, everything pretty solid out there?
as you're progressing towards unaccustomed territory for you at wimbledon, what is foremost in your mind?
what is the biggest difference for you this year as opposed to when you've struggled here?
the first time you stepped out here on grass, were you worried about playing?
the other day patrick mcenroe characterized you as a confidence player.  i guess he was saying for you to reach your potential, you have to get a few wins under your belt, then look out.  would you agree with that?  if so, what has winning these first two rounds fairly straightforwardly done for you?
can you say anything about the process by which you learn not to let your confidence dip with each loss?  was that through conversation with a coach or...
you have an interesting situation where you're obviously half american yet of english origin as well.  two very close yet different cultures.  can you talk about that quality.
in a word, your favorite part of british culture?
on the men's tour fashion seems to be coming more and more prevalent.  it's not just the women that everyone talk about now.  you've done modeling bits.  can you explain that a bit more.  also why do you think there's a growing trend of men wanting to look good on the court?
one follow-up on the fashion.  on the all-white outfit tradition, what do you make of it?
in the past you've talked to us about working on, improving various areas of your game, your backhand, return, volleying.
do you feel like it's still a work in progress or more like a finished product at this point?
is there some specific area you've been working on lately, something you feel needs improvement at this point?
you seemed to be enjoying yourself out there today.
have you heard many noises like that from an umpire before?
his microphone.
as you play, how much of it is the technical side and how much, as you win, is getting the confidence to go on to the next round in a grand slam tournament?
does each win add to the confidence?
you were talking last week a little bit about concentration was a thing you were working on.  are you better in your mind at that?  have you erased that problem?
everyone has been talking about the quality of the grass out there on centre, i think because it's open now, the grass in even better nick than it has been in years gone by.  do you sense that as well?
because it is more open and the wind is going to be a factor, do you sense it's going to be a trickier championship to win in those terms?  because it's going to be like this the next few days as well.
do you feel like the championships were more open to clay-courters or baseliners, rafael nadal, for example?  if so, what is the reason?
open.
there's a real chance for nadal to win, for the others?
real chance.
as a player i'm sure you like the truer bounce.  is there anything lost in having some of that quirkiness taken out of the surface?
i'm talking about funny bounces.
if the condition is so even, the condition of the court, you miss the bounces?
you've been in london for a few weeks.  you appeared on the jonathan ross show.  not too many tennis players do.  can you tell us how you enjoyed it, how you found the evening?
jonas bjorkman has spoken today about a quite serious issue, about how a few things have been disappearing from the player locker room.  your thoughts on whether you've had anything stolen, how unusual it must be in this environment for things to disappear?
this is a very special tournament for you.  can you tell us how you feel the first time you played here?  were you nervous, excited?  how was it?
how do you feel about fernando verdasco in case you have to play him?
it's a big day for the brits today.  how do you feel about gordon brown taking over?
you mentioned watching wimbledon as a kid, the ritual.  as usual there were articles in the paper about how wimbledon doesn't have the edge that it used to.
you are absolutely correct.
if there were one or two ways you could improve tennis in america, not saying it's good or bad now, but to make it even more dynamic, what would that be?
would you like to see andre having a more direct role in terms of player development in america?
did you catch any of james' comments yesterday?  he was a bit defensive about american tennis with you and he in the top 10, two guys in the top 10, is doing pretty well, and the bryan twins, et cetera.  we got into how do you make tennis more popular in the united states.
do you think you're in the kind of form that you can go all the way this year?
since your defeat at queen's, what did you do in the time off to improve your game in time for wimbledon?
you're staying in a rented house this year nearby.  does that help your preparation?  can you relax better in that environment?
what sort of things do you cook?
cakes?
how did you feel on the centre court in the new surrounding?
how did you like the conditions?  cooler than mallorca.
is it difficult to adapt to these conditions?
do you think the grass is the same as last year?
in the spring in the states, you spoke your season goal is to get to the masters and you would probably change your goal if you play on clay as good as the years before.  have you changed your goals now for the season?
did you watch any of the moya/henman game?  did you talk afterwards?
was your match today the most comfortable you've ever felt on grass?  do you feel you've adapted fully now?
carlos moya was playing very good on grass.  have you been practicing with him?  did you give him any ideas or tips?
you haven't played tennis on grass since 2004.  have you been practicing?
what was the atmosphere like?  what was it like playing not just against your opponent but with a crowd cheering for him?
we heard a lot of, vamos, carlos, too.  this was such a different game from what you usually play.  you serve volleyed very well.  was it fun to be out there in a match like that, that you may never play one like that again?
you passed the test.
did the ball get away from you on that last double-fault?
there were a few double-faults towards the end of last night.  was that at all to do with the wind?  it was noted that you had adapted your toss-up slightly.
did you find it windy in there at all without the roof on?
was that hard to adapt to?
how did you feel when he hit the second serve ace?
second serve ace, was that just a kick or a bad bounce?
do you have better memories now of wimbledon?  does this encourage you to come back again?
what do you do now?  you leave london tomorrow?
leave for mallorca?
was that tougher than you thought it would be?
the way the match was played, rallying from the back court, but also a target at the net, does that give you a bit of everything in terms of getting all the kinks out of the system, finding your own grass court game?
there was a lot of talk before the tournament that you had a pretty good draw here.  do you look ahead at that, or is that too dangerous to do that?
how would you characterize where your grass game is right now?
from a british perspective, what would be your advice maybe to somebody like richard who has a very low ranking?  what did you see today that was good?
it's easy to see like some guys, like federer, why grass courts suits his game.  you've had good really results here.  it's not as apparent why it suits you.  what do you think it is about the grass court that tends to bring out good tennis in yourself?
there's so little grass court tennis.  but there's so few guys that are grass court specialists.  is part of the key adjusting quickly?  is it a matter of who can make do in terms of adjusting their games?
you have sort of a lower profile here than when you were no.1, defending champion.  is there any sense you are able to sneak through a bit less noticed than before?
what do you know about bolleli, if he gets through?
wayne arthurs came back from two sets down against a bloke half his age.  we'll see the end of wayne at some stage over the next couple weeks.  how should we remember wayne arthurs as a tennis player, his career?
that must be up there with some of the best occasions you've had here?
after your sixth match point, did you have any sort of nagging doubts at all?
when was the last time you relished a match as much as you relished that one over the last couple days?
given all the sweet moments that you just described, how do you think you'll look back on this match?
how did you sleep last night?
years ago there was a krajicek match that got called off late at night.
anything similar?
how did the back pull out?
you played many, many second serves today than usual,  so what attitude did you have?
what did you think of the crowd's reaction?
john mcenroe was saying that with lpez coming up tomorrow having a bit more time to rest than yourself, it might be an issue how you go into the match in terms fitness.  how are you feeling?
you already mentioned the lack of the roof.  did that make the court play differently?  was the wind slightly different?
did they give you a choice last night?
you've already addressed all the pretournament speculation about retirement.  did that spur you on at all, coming into the tournament?
can you talk about your match tomorrow, lpez?
can you tell us about that second serve ace on breakpoint?  did you decide to go for broke?
in terms of the atmosphere, we all sense that cathedral-like focus wouldn't be there this year.  in a way, is it more open, more spontaneous or even better, god forbid?
this could easily have been a quarterfinal or semifinal match here.
surprised a few of your fans.  now there's a lot of expectation.
can they expect that?
when murray was out, did you feel the extra expectation coming up?
all the support you get.  i was up on henman hill.  describe the feeling.
as five-set matches go, where would that rank amongst your favorites?
in the circumstances, the last two days.
everyone saying, could you play another five-set match, win one?
we non-british writers thought we had written enough about you, then suddenly you give us today's story, for which we compliment you.  was there a sense that this may turn out to be the most interesting match of the tournament?  we see all these sluggers at the baseline.  this was so interesting.  did you have a feeling of great interest in this match?
would you say you were playing for those people on the hill, as well?
irrespective of how long you carry on, do you think it will always be henman hill?
it was packed this afternoon.
do you and andy murray ever have a bit of banter whether it should be murray mount or henman hill?
who wins the argument?
how was centre court without the roof?
what about the wind?
i saw video footage of you talking to figo in rome.  were you discussing your week in portugal?
you and andy coming out smoking serves first round.  i guess that's what you want to do here.
you've had some disappointing early exits this year.  can you put this into perspective, how much it means to get this out of the way, get it done in quick fashion?
are you following the mets from afar?
if i remember, after that day in paris when all the americans lost, you said, i guarantee we won't go 07, 08 at wimbledon, and obviously that is correct.
could you expand?  one of the great problems i think the media finds is there's no american star except for you two.  there's baseball, football, basketball.  do you think there needs to be a greater presence?  you can only play your own game.
you're a guy looking for a streak.  as you search for that, have you had to find your own way?  have you sat down with brian and tried to talk it out?  are you leaning on other people outside your tennis group to find that secret?
putting aside the question of the level of success of american tennis, if there were one or two things you could do to make it even better, more popular, what would that be?
how are you involved in the book?
did you sit down and write it?
are you going to make a tour?
you mentioned you're a mets fan.  are you also following barry bonds' home run chase?
you're known for some rather lengthy interview transcripts, which we all enjoy by the way.  how long is your book?
last year you were critical of vince spadea in terms of his revealing locker room information.  did you reflect on that issue, how much athletes should reveal, where the line is?
what's the name of it?
if i could beg to differ with what you said before about americans.  you and andy are actually the only ones that won so far here.  i'm wondering if we're at the point, post the fab four era, we need to set the bar lower but seriously set it lower about the results people like ginepri and fish and dent and these guys are going to put up?
relieved to finally put that match away?
74% first serves in, no breaks.  this is the way you win on grass courts?
how soon in a match do you know you're going to have a big day serving?
justin said you guys had some bets, you were betting over/under on dives and different things.
i think it was eight.
what was the bet?  gentlemen's bet?
do you consider yourselves friends over the years?
he boasted and claimed he was the best diver in the game these days.  would you comment on that?
dives per match, explosiveness, length.
what about artistic merit?
his half gainers sucked, though, on the dive, boris'.
you have a very good relationship with justin, but how easy do you find it to focus on knocking this guy out of wimbledon?
do you read his column on the internet?
if you had to vote for the board of directors, would you have voted for him or perry rogers?
board.
yes.
they could.  there's nothing forbidding it, but they never have.
justin made the first call of hawk-eye in wimbledon history as well.  did you have a bet about that before the game, who would be the first challenge?
do you think it's a good thing that it's been introduced here this year?
when you read justin's column about you, what were your thoughts there?  he propped you pretty good as the obvious no.2 coming in here.
do you like the support of your fellow players?  does it mean something to you?  either way does it not matter?
like justin saying andy is coming into wimbledon hot, playing at this level.
a lot of people in the era of roger federer might say a conversation on who's no.2 does have some relevance.
is it a big deal to have gotten your match in first on court on a day when there's rain, some people pushed to tomorrow?  at the beginning of a tournament, does that matter?
how many wimbledon titles do you think you would have if roger federer were not your contemporary?
aesthetically, in terms of the effect it will have on play, what do guys feel about the open centre court?
was the footing treacherous out there?
even without rain, the first few days can be slick.
looking way ahead to davis cup, are you surprised that the swedes are going hard court and are you pleased?
why didn't you leave the trousers on, really make a statement?
how did it feel to play out there in the new stadium?
how do you feel about your performance?  were you happy with today?
was that the kind of match you were looking for after not playing halle this time around?
john mcenroe said on television he was surprised you changed your routine.  he always kept to the same routine and he got to five wimbledon finals.  today i suppose you proved he was talking rubbish.
where is your body now?  do you feel a hundred percent?
i believe there were some federers listed as guests in the royal box today.  do you mind telling us if you had relatives here, and if that's customary for a first-round match?
wimbledon is obviously a very important tournament for you.  do you remember your feelings when you first made it in the main draw here i think like eight years ago with jiri novak?  was it special for you?
obviously the atmosphere out there is so different this year.  does the difference make you realize how special the feeling and atmosphere was at the old centre court?
we saw valentino rossi on the stands watching the game from your box.  is it great champions watching other champions?
the rain stopped him yesterday.  the same rain didn't stop you today.
did you ever have a wrist injury as serious as murray's?  how long did it take you to recover?
how long did it take to recover properly?
can you describe the different feeling going from the french, where every ball is coming up above your shoulder, coming to a slick grass court?  how does that match up with your game?
at the start it seemed you were both a bit nervous about the surface.  the conditions seemed cold and obviously damp.  was it tricky at that time?
how actively are you looking for a new coach?  is it a disadvantage not having one at wimbledon?
you said the other day you're not the enemy of the past, but you really are the enemy of the past.  the past doesn't seem to mind.  what did you mean by that?
you're not their enemy.  you feel some of them are your enemy?
you didn't make a hawk-eye challenge today.  i think if you would have looked up and seen your mug shot you may have challenged that, because it was rather bad.
the hawk-eye shots of your faces.  before you make the challenge, there's a picture of two players on the court.  yours was red and black and blurry.  it's just not very flattering.  perhaps you could challenge the quality of the picture.
do you think hawk-eye is accurate?
what are your thoughts after the match?  what are you thinking?
what was your feeling coming in?  were you nervous at the start of today's match?
now that you've been in the final, how hungry are you to be back in a final again?
you seemed quite happy about the amount of time he was playing between points.  you mentioned it to the umpire.  do you think it's fair the gap between points?
how does it feel to be in the top 20?
does this give you the confidence now to maybe break into the top 10?
how good was it having your mom and dad fly over for the match?
it was a dream for him to come here to see you play?
how long has he been speaking about that?
how does it feel to be a grand slam champion?
you said the other day you thought this could be kind of the changing of the guard.  do you feel that now with you and jo-wilfried coming through?
do you feel roger's dominance in the game is finished?
there are such small margins between defeat and victory, and you've tasted both in grand slam finals now.  what do you think was the special difference today that perhaps just gave you the edge?
as those set points were kind of ganging up on each other at the end of the third set, you really just had to keep your mind as focused as you possibly could.
you talked about the nerves a bit.  obviously a bit of a nervous start, breaks of serve and what have you.  what did you do today to help occupy your mind, and how nervous were you in the lead-up to tonight?
is it more pressure than you've ever felt in your life?
so what's on the agenda for tonight then?
yeah, i do.
is it a family celebration?
six of the last ten winners of the australian open have lost the first set.  does it mean anything to you?  you didn't say much about your serve.  but in the second and third set, you had 10 games when you lost only 10 points on your serve.  so that was probably a key, you think?
having played this match as the favorite, does it give you more appreciation for what federer and nadal have done, the position they've been in the last couple of years?
you say you're a people person.  is it very difficult to be playing against somebody who is such a crowd favorite?  second match in a row now.
it looks like a particularly heavy trophy.  when you went to lift it up, did it seem light or did it seem heavy?
would you like to play the whole year-round on hard court without having to having to also play on clay?
will it be tough at roland garros, you think?
when you were a small boy in a small country ravaged by war, could you imagine a day like this, when you are actually a grand slam champion?
was it a reality or was it just a dream?
was your family affected by the war?
can you tell a little bit how you became so good?  you mentioned several times the conditions in serbia weren't very good to be a tennis player.
everybody assumes they might have a bit of an idea of what it is like to actually win a grand slam.  when you do win a grand slam, what's it like?
can you relive the match point?
what do you remember of the celebration you had after paris when you and ivanovic and jelena jankovic were received in belgrade?  what do you expect now will happen?
how many people were there?
you're already a celebrity in your country.  grand slam champion.  how do you think you can cope with that celebrity?
what made the difference, roger?
he played very well, obviously.  but do you think your standard was as high as it always has been?
was it more difficult playing him in the semifinal than in the final?
do you think he'll go on and win the final now?
do you feel you were moving as well as you usually do?
do you put it down to anything tonight, or is it just one of those nights, as you say?
can you measure his improvement at all?  has he improved that much?
you were one break up in the first set.  that was probably the moment when you should have...
do you look back now and think about the preparation a couple weeks ago and the illness?  was that having a lingering effect at all on your game throughout this tournament?
you don't really feel like you've created a monster, do you?
can you elaborate on that?
do you need to be able to shut that out more?
justine said after her loss to sharapova that she suffered from the pressure of being unbeatable for such a long time and people always expecting her to win.  is that something you sometimes experience?
do you think if you were a little slower than usual, as you say, it could be because of the virus you had or the preparation coming in?
will you watch the final?
if you're away, will you try and find it on a television station somewhere?
did you feel during the match that there might be a moment you would seize control, or did you always feel you were playing catch-up after the first set?
are you surprised to be sitting here as the winner of that match?
your form under pressure, is that a factor that pleased you tonight?
what do you think you actually gained from having the experience of playing him in the us open final that you brought onto the court tonight?
what was going through your mind being down 5-3 in the first set?
why did you say that you had the feeling to play against two opponents at the end of the game?
did you feel federer was the same player that you played in new york?
what do you make of the last 24 hours when you've done what you've done to federer and tsonga did what he did to nadal?  is it a very significant moment, do you think, in men's tennis?
at what point in the match did you feel like, yes, this is in my control; he's not going to come back; and if i continue to play at this level this will really be mine, this victory?
i think kuerten was the last player who won three sets to love with federer, but i don't remember ever federer losing four times his serve in five consecutive games.  when he was up 5-3 he lost on the 10th game, the 12th game.  then he lost again on the fourth game of the second set and then again on the fifth.  do you think that it was that you were serving pretty well or that he wasn't serving that well?
it's the first time in almost three years that federer is not in a grand slam final.  for you it's a big achievement.  what does it mean for the world of tennis?
you said your ambition was always to be no.1.  having watched roger handle this pressure, knowing the way you've been gunning for him, can you imagine what it's like to be him?
what i mean is that kind of pressure.  you're talking about pressure in a match.
does it change anything, because you were always the underdog in those big matches so far?
you're a player that knows how to use emotion to play better.  did the crowd motivate you just like the time violation seemed to motivate you?
have you seen any tsonga matches?  were you surprised?
your opponent has 24 hours extra to prepare.  is that a significant advantage, do you think?
do you feel like your experience in big matches will work for you on sunday, given that he's played so few matches because of his injuries and you've played a lot more and played in a grand slam final before?
can you solve an argument i'm having with a commentary colleague.  do we pronounce your name djokovic or djokovic?
did you speak to janko at all?
you wish to be there now?
obviously you're not very happy.  what happened to your game out there tonight?
nothing?
you never seemed to be able to get into your rhythm.
you played federer maybe 14 times.  has federer ever played better against you than jo-wilfried did tonight?
in the break volley, did you think it was the turning point at that point?
so you mean it was lucky sometimes?  he was lucky sometimes on some shots?
can he beat roger?  if roger gets through, can he beat?
were you amazed that he didn't feel more pressure out there tonight, even in a semifinal?
what did the umpire have to say?  there was a change of ends and the umpire was speaking to you.  what was that all about?
until you ran into jo tonight, did you feel you were playing well enough to win this tournament?
when you played him at the us open, could you see the kind of game he could bring like he did tonight back then a few months ago?
38.
maybe that's the not real level of his game.  he's been hurt a lot.
can you give us your thoughts on the match?
any reason why you changed the outfit tonight?
tomorrow this place is going to be a buzz with talk about yourself playing djokovic.  do you get a little bit extra excited when you have young challenger coming up in a grand slam?
what do you make of the talk that some of these younger players are getting closer to matching you more consistently?
does all that talk fire you up with these guys coming in behind you?
the way you approach the play like djokovic is different than a player like nadal?  what are the differences in terms of preparation?  does it change anything or just in your mind, you know, that the game would be different?
did it surprise you that novak won in straight sets against ferrer, who is a consistent player?
semifinals.
how do you think your game is compared with this time last year?
are you still feeling any lack of match practice from not having any lead-in games?
novak himself says he still gets really nervous in matches.  is it important for you to get started on him and get pressure on him?
you seemed a bit more vocal and frustrated on court.  is that right?  and how come?
couple of line calls, or hawk-eye?
your mind is in australia, but will you play davis cup against poland in switzerland?
the ranking system, the anomalies of it, could have meant if you lost tonight, you may have lost your no.1 ranking.  i was just wondering, are you happy with the ranking system the way it is at the moment?
talking about points, what is your reaction to the fact that nadal has now more points than sampras has ever made in the atp, and he's still no.2 after 130 weeks?
when you hear novak saying, i think i can win the tournament and there's a feeling roger is beatable, do you get the highlighter out and circle that or say, i just heard it before?
you were saying on court to courier that it's kind of exciting, all the young guys from the semifinals, that you have the experience.  does experience really that matter or is it really form on the day?
just back to the us open final, roger, did you feel you played your best in that match and can you bring an even higher level when you play him on friday?
dominant first two sets, but it took you a little while to close out the match.  any explanation for that?
there were nerves at the end you mentioned on court, as well.  does that bother you?
is that the area you can make your most improvement in, you think?
most improvement in terms of your nervousness, your emotions.
do you talk to yourself, tell yourself to stay calm?  how do you do it?
belgrade has three players in the semifinal.  you said the other day that you don't have any hard court.  do you have an indoor court or not even that?
the money you make, ivanovic and jankovic, are you thinking to participate a little bit on that?
you spoke before of the pressure and expectation.  is there a different sort of pressure on you now, heading, say, into this major championship compared to what you felt going into previous semifinals, and particularly they're now saying you're going to be the guy to maybe challenge roger?
you want to take your time in terms of how you're going.  it just seems the game is getting impatient around you, for you to be the one in particular to take on federer.
what did you do with your left knee in the second set?
do you feel that you've moved on and are a better player than you were prior to playing roger in the final of the us open?
would you say that this surface helps you or helps more federer compared to the us open surface, in case you have to play him?
more than the us open one?
do you like better the bounce?
tipsarevic said you gave him good tip on how to play versus federer.  are you going to call him and ask...
(question regarding the first set.)
right at the end of the match, i think it was on the fifth match point, the umpire actually asked for a bit of respect from the crowd.  i think he said, be respectful, please.  you paused before you served.
did someone say something that wasn't...
given that it could have been a distraction at a very crucial moment of the match, how pleased are you with the fact that you were able to block it out and then go on and win in the way you did?
can you sort of expand on that point?  when you say you did something that, you know, could have resulted in going into a fourth set, what is it exactly you did?  was it by being distracted by the crowd?  were you annoyed at yourself for letting the crowd inside your head?
tsonga is in the last four.  are you surprised?
given that you would be a hot favorite against james blake, in a funny sense would you rather play roger in the semifinal?
you met roger now eight times.  how did tonight's match rank?
what makes him such a difficult opponent?
the tiebreaker, you were up 2-1, he was getting kind of grumpy, making some mistakes he wouldn't normally make.  do you sense there's a chance, suddenly he comes up with two amazing points?  does it still surprise you after all these years?
that said, do you still feel like he's a little more vulnerable here than some slams in the past based on some of his results, errors he's making?
offense being considered, do you consider yourself unfortunate or fortunate to play in the age of federer and sort of be able to test your game against him?
can you still take moral victories?  do you get any satisfaction, or do you have to win?
end of the first set, you missed a forehand you normally would make.  is that a situation you try to make the shot too good knowing the situation?  what's happening there?
are you going to see your giants play in the big game or not?
it was brought up in the last press conference that roger could have lost his no.1 ranking.  for a guy who's been in 10 straight major finals, winning eight of them, is there something wrong with the ranking system?
if roger had lost this match, rafa had won the tournament, then rafa would be no.1.
you guys had the huge high with davis cup.  because of the system, you have to go back and play again from zero.  how do you feel about that, and how tough is it going to be to fire up again?
could you make a short comment what you expect in austria, how tough it would be?
have you ever been skiing?
on tv they talked a couple times about how intimidating federer is.  does that intimidation come to you in any other way than his play?
you were playing very well today.  what happened today?
were you tired from the matches you played?
what do you think of his game?
do you think he can match nadal?
do you think he has some of the qualities that you need to play against nadal to do well against him?
you were very close to him in the third.  you had set point.  were you surprised that he kept his nerve as well, or not?  did you think he's a young player and he should be nervous?
what makes his serve so difficult?  the pace or something else?  what makes his serve so tough to return?
do you find him difficult to pass?  he's so big.
i suppose it's a bit cliche, but can you describe the emotion and the feeling you felt when you won that match point and collapsed to the ground?
you were very emotional when you spoke to jim courier afterwards.  was that part of the process of the long road back that you have had from all those injuries and just sort of overwhelmed you?
when you had those injuries, was there ever a time when you thought of giving up, of not coming back, and that this day might not happen?
can you just talk briefly about obviously the semifinal and how you see a matchup with nadal.  how will you approach that?
nadal is a different player from every other player.
have you played nadal before?
us open?
youzhny is a player with a lot of big wins.  he's won against nadal, won against federer.  was it a sufficient match, and what was the approach for you before you went into the game?
two set points you didn't do much wrong.  he was just too good on them?
you seemed to rattle him a little bit.  you seemed to change the depth of your balls a lot, change the speed and your pace.  is that what you have to do against him?
are you in the best form of your career?  how do you compare with other years that you've had good years?
you said you're in great physical shape.  is that because of your army service?
where is nadal at the moment?  what are your thoughts on him in the next two matches?
is there any particular part of his game that you fancy your chances of breaking down?  the second serve, the slice backhand or anything?
do you think this surface suits his game better than the old one?
is that the sort of match you needed at this stage of the tournament?
do you believe overall you are playing your best hardcourt tennis?
does this surface suit your game more?
you saved nine set points in the first set since the beginning of the tournament.  how important is it to win the first set to enter in the match?
what can you say about jarkko as a tennis player and a person?
how does your body feel compared to last year at the us open and hardcourts?
at the us open last year you were struggling a bit at the end.  is it much better now?
will you watch the other quarterfinal tonight?
do you have to tell yourself on court to play aggressively on hardcourts, or is it coming more naturally to you now?
so you think this would be a good season, or this season, for you to win an open rather than roland garros in one of the other surface?  if this season, 2008 will be the season where we see rafael nadal to win an open than the roland garros one?
a lot of your opponents are stepping into the court taking time away from you.  tsonga and youzhny both have that game plan, as well.  how are you going to try to overcome that?
simon and even, say, nieminen was stepping into the court, sort of taking time away from you.  tsonga and youzhny can sort of play that similar sort of game.  how are you going to overcome that?  what are your thoughts?
this might be the first time that you've reached a semifinal at a grand slam, and you haven't played so many hours on court.  can you talk about that and whether that's a very good thing for you?
novak said at the end he felt really, really nervous going into the match and it showed in that first set.  do you think that was the crux of the match?  had you got that one under your belt, might have been a very different story?
did you feel your last match in your legs?
physically tired, but was concentration also affected by the lack of sleep from the other night?
do you sense he's grown in stature, not only competitively but almost he seems to be getting taller and bigger, even since wimbledon?
all things considered, how do you assess your game at the moment?
what sort of measure has the tournament given you for the year, in terms of your hunger and the way you're playing as well?
playing in the tournament, do you feel the hunger?
how much did that 4:34 throw your body clock out of whack?
is your dream of winning the australian open beginning to fade?
what about future years?  do you think you can win it in the future?
i know it's a difficult subject, but the lateness of the hour in your previous match, do you think, all things being taken into consideration - it's always easier with hindsight - but do you think grand slam tennis should start, matches should start that late in the day, taking all the elements out of it?  a big match in a big tournament like this...
do you blame the late night for the loss?  simple as that.
jim courier i think said on commentary how you and tony roche were a work in progress.  how much more improvement do you think you've got in your game?
when can we expect you to be peaking, so to speak?
you said after you started with tony roche you would be peaking in about six months.  do you still think you can get there?
davis cup, you definitely going?
a semifinalist in last year's us open, how do you rate your form so far in this tournament?
there were lots of rallies out there, 27 shots in one rally.  is fitness your key?
for people that didn't see the game but look at the scoreboard, this seems like an easy win, but it isn't like that.
in that second set you used all your challenges.  normally you don't challenge that much.  what was up?
any effects from the five-set match the other night?
in principle, what is your view on grand slam tennis matches starting at a quarter to midnight?
do you have faith in the hawk-eye system?
when you were trouble a little bit the other day against tipsarevic, one set for him, 5-all, this guy called out, just keep going, rog.  would you ever hear something like that in the crowd?
he was a fan, just keep going, rog, one of your fans.
talk about what you're expecting in the matchup with james blake.
going back to night play.  some players love it.  some players don't like to play at might.  some don't care one way or the other.  what category are you in?
is there a time beyond which a best-of-five match should not start?
what else other than tennis have you been enjoying here in melbourne?
is your game any different this year?  you played four matches now.  is your game any different this year compared to last year because of the surface change?
based on what you just said, if you had been in the women's situation, the tournament came to you and asked you to move to vodafone, would you have declined to do that?
could you sum up the game from the tough start to actually winning.
you're used to being cast as one of the nice guys on tour.  what was it like being the villain?  it wasn't a hostile crowd, but they weren't on your side.
just in that first set there seemed to be times when the atmosphere seemed to be getting under your skin.  obviously, you weren't playing quite as well as you wanted to.
when did you feel he was getting tired?
getting closer to a grand slam win, do you feel now you're playing well enough to win this one?
is it tempting at all to look ahead to a matchup against federer in the semifinal?
do you think if lleyton didn't have the five-setter against baghdatis it would be different today?
so you are in the quarterfinals.  how do you feel?
ferrer is your next opponent.
how do you think the match will go?
you have been in this position at a few grand slams now.  do you feel, this one, you've gotten through expending the minimum amount of energy?  do you feel everything is as good as it can be at this stage of a tournament?
usually by this stage of a tournament we're talking about roger being on court half as long as everybody else.  bit of a different story at this tournament, isn't it?
you do a great imitation of maria sharapova.  the other day she was asked to do one of you.
she was afraid to break her back if she threw the ball as high as you do.
you struggled a little bit at the end of last year.  do you think you are back at your best level?
david said if he wants to win this match he needs to wear you down running.  do you feel physically ready for that match?
which are going to be those changes?
i saw your youngest brother practicing at one of the courts.  compared to you at the same age, how do you think he is?
are they your biggest fans?
how disappointed are you?
he said you played better in the second set and you should have won the second set.
would you change anything about the match, choices in the second set tiebreak?
pretty good start of the season.  how do you assess your game since the beginning of the year?
nikolay said he was very upset by your slice.  do you think it's one of the keys of the match?
people talk about this as being the most relaxed grand slam, that people are relaxed and confident and happy.  is that the same for you?  do you feel very relaxed here?
but sometimes at the start of the year, a surprise player does well here.  it's had a history of someone... .
you looked very confident on the court, your style of play and right from the start, you looked very pumped.
nikolay is your davis cup teammate.  has it been difficult to watch what's been happening away from the court with him with the investigation?
what do you know about jo-wilfried tsonga?
what do you fear in his game?
what was the difference between you and richard today?
when you first looked at the draw, and you had murray in round one, did you think the winner of that match had a great chance of making good progress here in the championship?
are you gaining more confidence as the matches roll on?  do you feel you could match it further in the tournament?
with the rest of the players.
having beaten murray in the first round, was it important to you to back that up, beating another player of equal ability and seeding?
was it difficult for you to put it out of your mind that he was your friend?
yeah.
you've now played two matches on rod laver arena.  what is your impression of the court, and how comfortable are you on this stage?
what do you think about the comparison between you and muhammad ali (laughter).
do you fly like a butterfly and...
was it more difficult mentally preparing for richard as opposed to playing andy murray in the first round?  they're both the top-10 players.
how excited are you at the way you're playing at the moment?
you spoke of center court, enjoying playing there.  how important is the crowd there?  you said you enjoy the crowd and enjoy the atmosphere and try to pump the crowd up.  do you draw from the crowd?
do you get confidence from the crowd?
do you enjoy that?
a lot of players say that this grand slam, because it is the most relaxed probably of the four, brings the best out of them.  do you feel that, too, that you are nice and relaxed, you're playing well and that it's an exciting situation for you to be in?
more relaxed than the french, probably?  more relaxed than playing at roland garros?
what was going through your mind during the second set when you were serving for the set, and then you missed that, and then you lost the set in a tiebreak?
the last few years in australia there's been players that have been the story, i mean, like baghdatis two years ago and gonzlez.  you're looking like that player this year.
how do you cope with all these people and extra attention and being the focus of it all?
your third grand slam quarterfinal.  how do you feel about getting there?
you haven't had anything come easily.  all the matches have been tough, five sets, four sets.  how are you holding up physically?
you won two critical tiebreakers.  are you a bit of an expert on playing tiebreakers?
is that maybe the difference between this quarterfinal and the last two you've played, i mean, this mental toughness?
james blake was saying that there are people who come along who could be no.1 or no.2 in the world are 1 in a million.  do you think it's all about experience?  i mean, the more you play, do you find it easier to make the right decisions and do the right things on court?
was it good to get a short match?
you looked very good out there.  what was really good for you tonight?
you're friends with fernando alonzo, the formula one driver.  did you have a chance to play tennis with him?
can it help you that you had such a short match and other players had longer matches later in the tournament?
do you think your half of the draw is the easier one?
were you surprised or disappointed by tonight's results?
did you know there was something wrong with him?  did you know he had an injury before he stopped playing?
but during the match?
do you feel any pain with the knees or something in your body?
you have a day off tomorrow.  what are you going to do?
how much were you limited by your injury?
what do you put the loss down to?
was it difficult for you confronting a friend?
what does it say about the game in france, you as the top-ranked frenchmen beaten by a frenchman here?
you were so close to causing a huge upset.  how does it feel?
you obviously had a pre-match plan.
the coach, in the media guide you have a coach; in the notes you have another coach.  who is your coach?  how many do you have?
the feeling in the stadium, did that help you?
you held serve eight times in the fifth.  during one of those changeovers were you thinking to yourself, this time i've got him?
it's been said that in order to compete with roger you have to delude yourself into thinking you can compete with roger.  how do you handle the issue of belief in a match like this, self-belief?
novak said he said something to you before the match.
do you care to share any of that advice?
that advice that novak gave you.
even if you were not afraid to play against roger, were you surprised yourself to stay during almost all the five sets at his level and to keep your level?
i've often heard you say you and the other serbian players have created what you have out of mud.  i wondered if there's ever a moment if a match, or in this match specifically, where you just thought, how did i get here?  this is amazing.
we are used to hearing that the one who wins has made the most important point.  but today you had three break points, and you made three breaks.  he had 21 break points, he made only 5.  that doesn't mean anything to you?
another thing is he made the 96 winners versus your 52.  but 39 were aces, and then there were at least 20 first serves that you couldn't read well, as you said before.  so that means from the baseline when you start playing after the first serve you compete even better than him?
he actually said that you will play him from the baseline.  was there a point in the fourth set that you started thinking about the fifth one and just let it go?
everybody's talking about djokovic, but now with your serve, with ivanovic and jankovic, there are many serbian players.  how do you explain this?
you think federer was nervous?  after the break he started walking the wrong way.
do you think this match is going to change your career?
even if it may sound novel at this question, if after four hours and 27 minutes you cannot read the serve of federer, how many hours and how many matches do you think you need in order to be able to?
so there is no hope?
you have a special shot on your backhand; am i wrong?
when you play with one hand on the side.  can you try and explain?
does it hurt?
is it true that you read a lot?
what kind of books?  what are you reading right now?
is it the tattoo?
realistically, what time do you think you'll get to bed?
did they consult you over whether you wanted to play?  you went on at 11:49.
more beneficial to come back tomorrow and had a day's rest or get it over and done with?
do you think you can buck up?
do you think starting a match at that time of night is decent, is good?  you know, when it goes through your head what to make a decision about, what goes through your head?
how are you feeling at the moment?
is that your best win in a grand slam since 2005 here?
what's your routine going to be like now?  you'll probably get to bed at 7:00, irregular sleeping hours?
you played a few memorable five setters in your career.  where does that one rank?
you've obviously gotten close with federer, djokovic, nadal over the last four months, but you haven't really had a major scalp.  how important is it to get that one tonight confidence-wise going into tomorrow night's match?
can you just talk about the emotional roller coaster that you would have been going through in that match, the ups, the downs, the crowd the atmosphere and all that?
what was going through your mind in the fourth set when you squandered the 5-1 lead?
when you looked over on the other side and saw him lying on the ground in agony, grabbing his ankle, could you imagine three hours later he'd be up there?
djokovic has established himself as the clear no.3 in the world.  how do you go about hurting him, and how does your game match up with his?
was it a nice moment at the end of that match, lleyton?  can you share with us what you exchanged?
yes.
when they told you that the women were going to play, did you have a choice?  did you and marcos actually have a say?  did you have a choice in whether you were going to play or not?
what do you think of that?
what do you think of the fact that you didn't have a choice in such a situation?
how long before the start were you told that you weren't going on?  how long before 9:00 were you told that you weren't going on?
pretty difficult to deal with?
marcos was talking to the french reporters.  he said his understanding was if the women had gone three sets you wouldn't have played at all.  was that your understanding, as well?
have you had any situation like this?  i mean, not just the lateness.
roger, what are your thoughts on the incredible match we saw out there on center court?
he said he outplayed you from the baseline.  was there a specific area that you felt in trouble with?
you went 21 break points and you made only five breaks.  that was not usual in your game.  what is your explanation?  he was serving well or you were returning so-so or what?
he had three break points and he made three breaks immediately.
a four-hour match like that so early in the tournament, is that beneficial for your campaign, or a hindrance?
the condition you can play in melbourne, you know, open, with the roof closed, which one do you prefer?
roof, the situation.
was that the toughest match since the wimbledon final?  and was there any moment in the fifth set where you just couldn't get a look at his serve that you were thinking it might go wrong tonight?
were you at any point concerned as the match went on?
was there a specific moment when you were more worried?
what was the problem with your feet?
you say that he believed in his chance.  do you enjoy playing a match against a guy like that more than a guy who you see his shoulders slump a little bit and know that he doesn't believe that he can beat you?
do you have any idea what the tattoo on his arm says?
given the recent illness, was there any stage where it particularly set in and you felt you were getting low on the tank?
did you get to thinking during the match, jeez, this court is so slow?
the other match hasn't started yet.  if you were in that position, would you be want to be going out to play at midnight potentially?
tipsarevic just said he's reading for the third time the idiot of dostojevski.
it's a book called the idiot.  i ask you which book are you reading?
first time ever, please tell us what do you think about this other match.
did you think he could play at that level?  i mean, he maintained a fantastic level throughout the match.  did you think he could do that?
before the match, would you have said that he could do that?
what about your match today?  it was the complete opposite.  how did you see your form today?
sam says that he found you intimidating.
that's the world he used.
her too.
well, i think he said it's a combination of the way you play and the way you carry yourself.  do you feel that you carry yourself differently than you did a year ago?
he's about a foot taller than you, too.
does it encourage a player like you to see roger being stretched and kind of struggling out there?
are you going to wait tonight to see the match, baghdatis and hewitt?
this tournament is known for having such international color in its crowds and a lot of people love that, players and fans a like.  but sometimes it gets nasty.  do you think, overall, is it a positive or negative that there are so many people that are so, sort of nationalistic?
maybe it helps to be a soccer fan if you're here?
what's your favorite slam?
are we seeing the new mario ancic of the game?
how does it feel to be in the fourth round of a major?
must be giving you confidence to make this kind of a run.
were you encouraged at all as a youngster to be a basketball player instead of a tennis player?
so you weren't tall at seven?  you were small?
croatia has won the davis cup final in bratislava three years ago, did that make special encouragement for you to step up, be a better player?
but you never played basketball then?
but you didn't, seriously?
what about blake?  you played him a year and a half ago or so.
you're expecting a much better match than in bangkok?
how tough is that to swallow?
what about that turn?  i mean, 5-1.  you were going for all the money.  what happened?  did you just sort of go for broke?
you must be exhausted.  can he recover?
your fans again tonight, it's 5:00 in the morning and they were still cheering as loud as ever.
you leave melbourne with some great memories again?
congratulations.
were you affected at all by the ankle injury?
tough one, andy.  talk about how you're feeling.
his level was pretty high, though.  except for the second set, especially on his own service games, pretty good.
have you ever played that well and lost?
the various things that annoyed you during the match, was that emotion that you were able to feed off or do you think it took away from what you were trying to do?
it was quite a bit steamier in there than it's been for other matches.  was it tough to stay alert, a hundred percent?  you looked like you were sweating buckets.
did 2003 go through your mind at all?
when did you think about it?  in the fifth?
can you give a view on what happened when he first had a match point and called the challenge.
you tried a lot of ways to get into his service games.  especially the last set, seemed like you were climbing uphill the whole time trying to get the ball back in play, and then he was dictating pretty quickly.
no.  i don't need to monologue.  i'm just asking how you approach.
was he that hard to read service-wise?  he was hitting lines.
hindsight is always 20/20, but anything you would have done different if you had it to do all over?
104 winners.
do you feel a little on a rollercoaster after this fantastic davis cup win and now this one?
will you defend the title in the first round in austria?
yes.
where does that backhand fit in in the hierarchy of backhands in tennis, his shot?
his backhand.
well, let's go tonight.
is the disappointment more in the loss, or that you had kind of an up-and-comer just zone on you for that long?
now that you're out, any thoughts about the court?  the speed slower than the past?  not quite as advantageous to your game?
can you remember the last time you had to save six set points in the first set of a match?
did you just feel that you started very slowly today?
is the overriding emotion more relief to get through?  are you happy to have got through, given the start?
what's going through your head when you're down 5-2 in a set?
what do you do on your day off?  reading your blog, you used to play playstation with ferrer.
australian siesta.
you didn't like the center court beforehand.  you told us about playing on the outside courts.  how did it feel to have the crowd behind you at the end?
who is responsible for that backhand of yours?
did someone influence the way you learned to strike the ball?
you played well the whole match.  did you feel when you had a few match points late in the fifth set you wouldn't get the job done?  you got a little frustrated?
speaking of hawk-eye, he got angry a couple times about a few of the umpire's decisions.  did you just concentrate on your game or did that put you off at all?
what about recovery?  do you go and do something now, or do you just want to get to bed.
is it a concern you might not be able to get to sleep and get recovered in time?
you were out there for almost four hours.  what does this match say about you?
how was that for you?  looked like a bit of fun.
pardon me?
i guess as the game went on, there were some amusing moments prompted by yourself.  what was your thinking behind that?
pointing to the scoreboard at the end.
you're retiring at the end of the year?
you're not a hundred percent?
what did you think of the reaction of the crowd today?
so it would be quite tough to say good-bye then?
you've seen roger through almost a decade now.  how does his game this year compare with other times you've seen him?
as somebody who appreciates tennis history, is there any part of you that just enjoys the chance to play him, even if it is so difficult to beat him?
because why, in particular?
is this a frustrating feeling or is it just like, just two or three guys can beat him?
when you play him, you said it's a nice feeling, besides the score.  but isn't it better than to watch him?
do you think richard gasquet might be the same artist as you have been for so many years?
in terms of style, he's going to walk in your footsteps?
you gave it a good fight.
what is your main emotion after that?
what's the reason for it?
when was the last time you played that well and lost?
is it your choice of shot or...
how did you get back into the match after those first two sets?
if you had got through that, do you think your game's at a level where you could have beaten roger federer down here?
since agassi and federer, you were the one to have the most success on the rebound ace.  the transition, how do you view it, the court characteristics?
are you encouraged by your form today for the rest of the year?
what's your feeling after that?
what was your feeling after the first set?
is it one that got away?  i mean, is that the overriding feeling?
was it back or leg?
where do you think you are from just making it?  he's a top 10 player.  how far away from him are you?
you can obviously go out there thinking you can win and you win a first set against a top-10 bloke.  how do you measure that?
what sort of burning in the guts does a match like that give you?
you and robert need to get together to work out how to knock him off?
do you think there's something perhaps technically you could do to help get above these guys or do you think it's purely a matter of gaining exposure against the big guys and getting better playing in big-match situations?
what did you think about today?
you service games, you had him under pressure in the second set.
did that contribute to that?
what did you learn about yourself today that perhaps you need to improve?
where do you go from here?
tough going back, having been in main draws three weeks now...
how much of a thrill was it being out there on the court with all the fans?
former no.1.  did you ever feel intimidated at all by him?
what was your mind-set throughout the game today?
you played here seven years ago now?
what was different?
what do the top players do to make them so difficult?
the big points, obviously?
you really scrapped the first two sets.  do you think when a bit of time goes by, do you think you can be proud of yourself today?
early on in the third, looking a little grim for you.  did your spirit break at all?
you still got your eyes on that top 100 spot?
just giving you some extra confidence going into the year?
can you get a tape of that match?
can the coach inquire?
when do you find about the ais scholarship?
any sense of recognition between you and ferrero, seven years down the track?
he said yeah, i think i beat him in four sets.
was that a solid workout?
how would you describe your form to this stage?
is there room for improvement to come?
frustration for you that in adelaide you played two good matches, one not so good.  here, fantastic first match.  second one not so good.  is that something that is part of the change in the game that you're trying to get into a groove?
is the concentration, the mind wandering, is that something that happens when you haven't played as much tennis?  when you play more, you tend to be sharper?
you had hoped to come in a fair bit more than what you did?
treatment at the end of the second set, is that a bit disconcerting?  should the rule be tweaked?
seemed to revive him.
sort of the tournament starts now?
do you think your game matches up better against one or the other of them?
will you watch any of it?
i guess maybe safin, maybe baghdatis.  on saturday night of the australian open, is that about as good as it gets for you?
you anticipate a real sort of atmosphere on the court?
do you think you have to improve significantly on today to beat either of those guys?
have you got any thoughts on the court, how it's playing for you?
is it slightly slower than last year?
you said you know you can compete with the other two at your best.  how close to your best do you feel you are?
is your confidence at all diminished by today?
do you think you play at your best when you are aggressive in matches such as today, and that conversely, when you don't attack, that's when you're vulnerable?
do you have a different approach in the second week of a tournament, different strategy, different tactics?
there were one or two rallies in that match similar to the match you played against him at the us open a couple years ago, but the result very, very different.  do you feel significantly better than you did back then?  are you a better player now?
it was a pretty friendly match.  could you describe what was going on on the very last point?
fabrice has kind of said one of the keys to his longevity has been that he can just enjoy tennis.  i guess in this case, even when he's losing quite a bit.  can you describe your own relationship with tennis, for better or worse?  is it the kind of thing you love even when it's difficult?
is it all the more a pleasure to play somebody like fabrice who is kind of the same mindset?
you played your best at both the masters cup and here after people had raised some questions at the masters cup, after you lost your second match in a row in four-and-a-half years, then today coming in here and being a little ill.  when people question your abilities, does that motivate you?
you have a pretty average five-set record.  it's not in sync with the rest of your career.  is that a misleading statistic?  what do you make of that?  is it a stat that players pay attention to?
as someone who does love the game, the spectacle of it all, the characters, will you be turning on the tv tonight to watch baghdatis against safin?
what's your thoughts on your next round against tipsarevic?
would you please explain what means your nickname, nole?
looked like a very comfortable match for you.
what is your thought on the next match?
how do you physically feel now?
you mentioned on the court that you weren't happy with your service today.  what did you think was happening with your serve?
you made a lot of bad mistakes, hitting the ball wide and things like that.  is that hard for you to get your rhythm in a match like that?
janko had a good match today and the next opponent is federer.  what do you think he can do?
at this stage of your career, where it is easier to motivate for the later stages of tournaments and play against the bigger names, how do you manage playing these first rounds mentally?  how do you prepare?
pretty comprehensive win out there in the game.  do you know michael's game pretty well?
what do you think about your next opponent, sebastien grosjean?
do you think the surface can be an advantage for you, because you played him only on clay and grass?
you seem to be getting more and more comfortable in melbourne.  how is your tournament going so far?
the happy slam.
you don't find the relaxed atmosphere distracting at all?
how important was the davis cup win for your career, that experience?
will you be in austria, the whole team?
the davis cup, there seems to be a team spirit in america at the moment that hasn't been there for a while.  does that make it harder to play another american in a grand slam?
looking at some five-set records, not to bring up a touchy topic, but it's a strange stat.  you see federer is 10-10.  it doesn't go in sync with his career.  you don't have a great five-set record.  what do you think are the elements that go into it?  do you put much stock into it as a stat?  if so, what makes someone a good five-set player?
deeply entertaining match for the public.  a lot of good shot making and, did you enjoy it at all or were you totally focused on it?
what do you think about him?  i mean, you were not sure what's coming your way most of the time, right?
do you enjoy those scramble points?
you seem to be willing to play a number of them.
how much slower is it at night compared to a day match?
mardy was saying he didn't feel it was necessarily the surface that slows it down, and it slowed the balls more than anything.
so how many games do you think it takes, generally or points?
you've got a little bit of a german week this week.  kohlschreiber is next.  have you followed his development throughout the years after you played him her last three years ago?
nice to see mardy back in again and playing well?
do you think there's something about this tournament that suits him especially, andy?
he was saying that he feels like he's kind of a small town guy.  melbourne fits his personality a little bit better maybe than new york does.
he said you guys were already planning the bachelor party, huh.
does mardy get any input on the bachelor party?
can we discuss the whiffs now?
just not seeing the ball right or just one of those things or what?
it wasn't a total whiff, the first one.  didn't make contact a little bit?
is the first week of slams now for you sort of about maintaining and trying a couple different things, not getting overly anxious, because you know that second week comes and all the good stuff has to come out?
was it good to get a much easier match than your first round?
were you more aggressive?  were you a little bit more aggressive than the first round?
do you prefer the day matches to the evening matches?
what do you think of last night's incident with the pepper spray?
how do you feel about this slam down in australia versus the others?
you think the slam is too early in the calendar?
you've been no.2 for a long time now.  is it becoming frustrating that there's always the one man ahead of you?
were you aware, depending on your results and roger's results, you could actually take over the no.1 ranking after this tournament?
did you see any of roger last night?
did you get much of an impression on how he looked?
you've been the subject of some doping rumors at some point.  so you know how difficult it is to have that around you.  what is your opinion of how long it's taking to finish the investigation in the gambling case at sopot?  is it taking too long, do you think?  is it unfair to the players.
before, in the past, yeah.
do you think the investigation is taking too long, or it's fine?
how do you rate this grand slam win with other grand slam wins you've had in terms of ease?
well it looked easy on the scoreboard.
i remember the look on your face at the us open last year after the robredo loss when you had big chances.  it seemed like today you focused the whole time and didn't let anything get away from you.
so your attacking game just worked all day today, huh?
are you concerned about the pepper spray incident last night?
so it doesn't dent your idea of the tournament?
obviously you play around the world.  the crowd here, is it something particular about the crowds in particular in the outside courts in terms of is there an edge or something about them that's a little bit different than elsewhere?  i'm trying to get to the bottom of how it gets to this stage.
is there a flip side to that?  do you feel there's an edge where it can get over the top, or do you think it's great to have that as an advantage?
are you playing the best tennis of your career at the moment?
how did you feel about the davis cup when that happened and the u.s. won?
how would you describe this current generation of american players who are probably not as high profile as the agassi/sampras period?
do you feel less pressure here than you do in new york?
you've been on the stuff enough now, the surface.  they've changed it from perth and here.  does it beat your body up a little bit less than the other stuff used to?
some of the guys have been saying that maybe the bounce is maybe a little too low for the clay court guys, but you don't think that's true?
is speed overrated compared to bounce in terms of the effect it has on players who like different surfaces?
is there a measurable difference between this surface and the us open?
is it a lot or just a little?
nieminen drives a lot of guys nuts.  what's your history with him?
you set the record?
what does it mean to you, this record?
anything deeper than that to you as a person?
why have you been able to maintain a level for so long?
you told us last year the ambition you still have is you want to play at wimbledon centre court.  how long do you think it's going to go on?
do you enjoy your reputation as a frustrating player?
considering you have survived so long in tennis, i know you said your style has changed over the years, but ostensibly you've been a very different kind of player, are you surprised not more players have tried to be a little different, whereas tennis now has so many players that are so much the same?
you played the tallest opponent you've ever faced today.
but he's pretty big.
yeah.
do you think in ten years' time a player like fabrice santoro could be playing the sport because there will be so many big guys out there?
is the trend going to be that there is going to be huge basketball players playing tennis, so will that make it difficult for a guy your size?
what do you think of probably next match against federer?  is it the end of your australian open 2008?
have you thought about what you are going to do once you do retire?  are you going to be a coach?
because everyone says you're their favorite player to watch.  so teaching other players to play...
not on the road.
your family has helped elongate your career.  some players would find it very hard to continue playing with a child.
how did you assess your match today?  straight sets, but it looked a bit up and down.
any parts of your game you've got to work on to progress further?
what does it take for you to be happy about your game?
going to need more confidence going into the harder part of the draw?
i heard you have been doing snowboarding back in europe.  did you find it fascinating?
are you any good at it?
not too many falls?
what is your fear about the new surface?
how do you rate that win with others that you've had?
are the show courts like your home ground almost?
how many times have you played on center court?
on margaret court?
you got off to a great start.  how important was that?
were the nerves a new feeling?  expecting them to come?
did you expect that you and alun would get through?  did you talk about it at all?
i think david nalbandian looms in the next round.  what are your thoughts about that matchup?
probably have a chance to put your hand up now.  prefer to play on margaret court or one of the show courts?
are you going to have nothing-to-lose attitude, be a bit cavalier, take a few risks?
do you think those matches where someone play plays sort of like yourself where the people who are supporting you principally supporting australia.  is it a little bit like some of the davis cup matches that you play against in other countries?
do you think that's the reason why you haven't been past the first round other than here?
have you set yourself any goals for the year?
it's been a while coming.  did you start to doubt that this might ever be?
pretty much as well as you've played.  how would you rate the actual standard?
is that confidence coming from the fact you played so many matches or you changed some aspects of your game?
did you play the challengers before christmas?
i think you told me your result.
in?
and the shoulder?
did you start the playoff at all?
did you always think you'd get a wildcard?
what's the coaching arrangement at the moment?
through the ais?
was there a point today where you felt you had it, or did you not think that until you got to matchpoint?
know much about him?
did you sense de'ja vu at all when you were two sets up?
that crowd support, what did it do for you?
some of these guys have been coming to the australian opens with you since 2001.  it's been a journey.
we asked joe sirianni in adelaide if he was doing something different to have this sort of lease on life.  he said he was drinking three glasses of red wine each night before he went to bed.
have you introduced anything sort of a bit whacky into your routine?
some frustration with line calls early on.  suppose if you had hawk-eye you would have used it.
did that sort of play on you at all?
very intimate, that crowd.  does the pressure build on you?
so is the feeling what you imagined it would be, all these years of buildup?
will you watch a bit of kiefer and ferrero?
good feeling around australian tennis.  chris made the final in sydney, yourself, sirianni.  do you feel something special?
how do you attribute your improvement in the rankings, the training support you've had and finance support?  a bit of vindication for that support?
albert changed his shirt about three times.  are you on limited rations of shirts?
that would have to be the best start you've had in a grand slam.
was that the key to your game, aggressiveness?
was there something particular you worked on with rochey that you saw the fruits of today?
was there anything that tony wasn't happy with today?
do you still get the collywobbles just before you go out for an australian open?
butterflies in the stomach.
no more so this time?  you had been out of the game for quite some time last year.  no greater anxiety to want to do well?
you said you worked on your serve.  was there anything that you tinkered with that worked well today?
there's been some impression about you can mix it with the top players anymore.  does that give you confidence you can, give you that confidence boost?
what do you know about the next one?
you've never seen him play?
two sets up and 5-love, 30-love, you called for the hawk-eye on that line call.  tell us about your reasoning for doing that.  given the circumstances of the match, do you take any of that into account?
obviously you're well ahead at that stage.  do you take that into account?  do you really need to challenge this one?
how much more settled do you feel than this time last year?  you've settled in with tony.  everything seems to be heading in the right direction.  do you feel that's impacting on your game or that it will very soon?
how curious are you and some of the other players to see what roger's going to look like tonight because of the health problems?
how much stock do you put into santoro's record for breaking agassi's record for slams in the open era, and why do you think he's the guy that's done it?
yes.
62.
do you feel it's a real accomplishment?
can you see yourself out there in your mid 30s in grand slams?
just looking on, it seemed that if things might have gone differently in that first-set tiebreak might have gone a bit differently for the rest of the match.
did you have a feeling in your mind when the net cord bounced on your side of the net that that was a significant moment?
how are you feeling physically today?
consistency in your game probably the next thing you have to improve on?
after the great ride in sydney, what is the overriding feeling now?
had you set yourself to go past that first round this time around?
given the way sydney went so well.
some people might think after the emotions last week you might be feeling a bit flat.  you said physically you feel fine.  how was it emotionally trying to lift yourself again this week?
as the match wore on, your first two service games went to love, he seemed to get an increasingly better read on your serve.  in the second set you served over 80%, but he still broke you.
is it a fair criticism that if your serve gets tamed there's not enough there for you to fall back upon at this level?
it looked as though the crowd was doing everything humanly possible, aside from jumping out there to pick up a racquet.  pretty amazing.
coming into this game on such good form, did you feel more expectation, more nervous compared to past australian opens you've played in?
do you do anything to try to calm your nerves?
did lee do some things that surprised you today that you didn't expect him to do as well on certain shots?  was there something about his game that surprised you?
you're obviously feeling pretty good.
you should be sick more often.
in terms of, as you say, a first match for quite a while, that was rather emphatic, even by your standards.
considering the lack of match practice that you've had, is it a good or bad thing that you had a game which lasted a little over an hour tonight?
you said you checked his results.  you usually check the results of your opponent on the internet?
did you expect to be that fluid, given your preparation?  did the last few days of practice make you feel that sort of performance was going to come out tonight?
was it just food poisoning that you had?  do you feel completely better?
and it was food poisoning?
can you have peace of mind going against your next opponent, santoro?
he broke andre's record for grand slam appearances today.  i'm sure you know that.  are you surprised a player with that style has had this kind of longevity?
the shot that perhaps gave you the most enjoyment was the ace after, as it were, you were hawk-eyed.  gave a smile back and forth.  was that almost the most satisfying moment of the match?
a lot of variation in the third set.  were you just experimenting?
nalbandian has had some good results against you.  do you look ahead to a possible showdown later on?
more information about how these courts react to different spins versus the rebound ace?
slice is not as effective?
you still think it's too slow?
do you feel like congratulating your opponent after these kind of games?
how did it feel to come out here as third seed as opposed to last year when you were much lower ranked?
what was the difference in the first two sets and the third today?
how did you find the speed of the court?
at the masters cup you talked about how tired you were from such a long year.
what did you do during your break to recharge?
when you were asked afterwards to do those impersonations, you didn't look too comfortable.
she doesn't mind?
when somebody in the top 10 loses in the first round, as andy did, is that a reminder to people like yourselves who are the fancied guys, that you have to be totally switched on from the first ball?
do you feel more pressure now because of your ranking and the expectation that is on you?
tonight's match is a little bit different.  usually when roger plays, we know how great he is.  do you think the players are going to be more interested than usual because there's this health issue?  people wonder if he's ready to play the tournament.
you mentioned a moment ago five-setters, not a lot of tournaments these days where you play five sets.  you have quite a good record:  7-3.  what goes in to someone who is a good five-set player?  are you aware of other players who have good or bad records in five sets?
you were talking about improving elements of your game.  can you elaborate on that?  any particular element or combination that you felt you really improved or are doing better?
what's it like having a bunch of teenage girls screaming that they love you?
two years ago you were in the little interview room with andy murray and andy was giving a press conference about all his troubles.
are you surprised like how much has changed for both of you in that time?
he broke you back in the first set.  once you got over that it seemed to flow.
how tough was it to recover from sydney?  that must have been disappointing.
did you give isner a scouting report before the match?
he broke andre's record for grand slam appearances today.  can you comment on his longevity?
yes.
how much of a springboard do you think the davis cup is going to be for you this season?
did it give you more confidence?
how different are these courts to sydney, if at all?
you beat a former champion today.  what pleased you most about the match?
what is wrong with your hamstring?
the start of the third set?
so mobility-wise you were okay in terms of moving, though?
you again had the whole crowd behind you.  you were revving the crowd up.  is that something you thrive on?
is there anything you have to work on before the next round?  you were very aggressive today.  that's part of your game, isn't it?
a chance you'll have to play marat.  what are your thoughts on him?
what mindset have you come to melbourne with this year after last year's tournament?  you had problems off the court, distracted by certain things.  how are you approaching this one?
have you done any particular measures this time around that you thought about from your time here last year?
you did well on rebound ace.  what do you think of this surface?  do you prefer rebound ace or do you prefer this?
do you find it slow?
what was your preparation before you came to australia this time?
maybe expectations aren't so high this year from the crowd.  do you like that situation?
very tight match to come through.
what pleased you most about your game today?
did you have some leg problems?
how good does it feel to have beaten someone ranked so high?
were you worried when he came back so well in the third?  how worried were you at that stage?
is consistency something that you've got to work on?
being consistent.
you missed a couple of years with injuries.
you've had some good results at the u.s. and french open.  your development is a bit slower than marcos, who is the same year as you.  are you confident of continuing that push through to a top 20 or top 10?
are you worried about a let-down at all?
how do you avoid that, to make sure you keep going on, to remain concentrated?
how do you stay mentally tough in a very stressful situation like that?  you talked about your leg cramping up because of the stress.  how do you deal with the mental side of the stress?
you won the support of the crowd out there.  did you feel that at all?
you approached the net 102 times.  is that usual for you?  did you go in with a game plan of coming to the net a bit more often against murray?
do you think the doubles performance in sydney helped that aspect?
comfortable way to start the tournament.
i know you played over in kooyong.  what is your sense of what it does for your game, doesn't do for your game, the surface?
any other tournaments around the world you'd compare to how it plays?
if you have to play donald next round, is it going to be an advantage you've hit with him so much in the last few months?
any sense of excitement to start the new year or is it a case of, here we go again?
santoro is about to break agassi's record of slams played.  do you put much stock in that kind of a record?  why do you think a guy like santoro would have such longevity and staying power?
did you end up playing in the poker tournament?
do you think the davis cup could be a real springboard for you this first part of the year?
andy murray just lost.  i know there's a lot of attention on you as an american in the american media and everything.  do you feel for him a bit?  do you think it is that much more obsessive in britain with him, compared to, say, guys like you and a lot of other players?
what do you make of the color of the court, the blue compared to the green?
roger said yesterday he prefers the blue.  he said there was something strange about playing in the green.  i don't know if it was like washed out or something.
what are your thoughts on the balls?  gasquet in sydney said they fluff up a fair bit.
you had to work very hard for that, didn't you?
what do you think was the key to your victory?
is it the sort of performance that gives you confidence going forward in this tournament?
what do you make of it all?
normally you make very good decisions on court all the time.  today you seemed to not make the right decisions all the time.  was there any reason for that?
in the first set he won 20 of 37 points at the net.  you won 6 of 14.  did you allow him to take the initiative in terms of aggression?  did you stay back too much?
one of quite a long line of players that won qatar, then crashed out here early.  are you satisfied that coming down here sort of six, seven days before is early enough?
so you felt physically great out there today?
what did you feel about your serve today?  he was hitting a lot of big returns, wasn't he?
is there anything you can take out of this match that will help you in the future?
is sort of the sense of disappointment magnified because everything had started so well, the season, you had such a good training session in america, feeling good about yourself?  does that sort of heighten your disappointment?
where would you like to be in 12 months' time ranked?
how much is that streakiness hard to play against?
what do you think of jamie's qualification here and he got a set off karlovic in terms of davis cup coming up?
it's obviously early days to reflect.  what do you think you'll do now, between now and buenos aires?
what did it feel like, first sort of chance into it?
was it a nervous time?
how close did you feel to getting over the line, couple of break points there?
is that part of the learning experience now?
had you ever seen him play or were you able to do some research on him?
he called the trainer in the first set.  seemed to be moving freely in the second set.  was it a distraction at all in the second set?
did you have some problems with your knee or something?
were the unforced errors a bit frustrating?
the conditions, how tough was it down there?  a bit blustery?
you're obviously a very passionate player.  is it something you're trying to curb, or working on?  how are you trying to keep the passion but not get to an explosive stage?
are you getting help with that or working yourself on that?
did you get any warnings today?
is there a way to channel it, keep the passion but a way to channel it?  is that something you're working on, trying to keep the passion but channel it differently?
have you ever played in front of a crowd like that?
what are you doing for the rest of the year?  what are your plans?
traveling abroad?  do you have any thoughts on where you might take the year?
will you come back to melbourne or stay in perth?
what was the main lesson from the match today?
what's the transition from juniors playing against top players?  what's your early impression of those players?
pretty big two weeks in tennis.  fast tracked you.  how do you look at what it's done for you the past couple of weeks?
been a pretty whirlwind couple weeks for you since then.
are you looking forward in a way to not being the reigning australian open junior champion?  a little less scrutiny this year.
what were the advantages and disadvantages of putting yourself out there that way?
a good start over a player that's been in form.  must be pleased with your win.
what pleased you most about the match?
normally you have a lot of five-set matches.  must have been pleasing to go through in straight sets.
(from italian) you didn't miss the presence of high-ranked players such as roddick and the others, and wawrinka was playing so well today, especially in the first set. did he give you a hard time, and did you expect it?
have you been asked about your volleying? i just got here. seemed to be very important to you.
you are the best player, this year at least. what do you think you still would like to have better? i mean, where you could find space for improvement, especially one shot or one thing?
(from italian) you speak italian and you work with an italian doctor. how much of an italian personality is there in you?
now that you've won your first clay masters series, it's become very obvious that your game translates to all surfaces very well. are there adjustments that you make when you come to play on clay, or do you basically approach it the same way as hard court or grass?
at the beginning you would you were a little nervous because you are the favorite. what's so difficult about being the favorite? what is the problem?
what is your view of the collapse of nadal and federer?
you don't do anymore imitation. can you explain to us that you don't do because someone asked you to don't do it?
maybe because it make you more stronger, you know, gives you some advantage in some way?
no. if you don't because people don't want you to.
can you describe what happened, andy?
upper back in the shoulder?
what are your plans now?
you hope to stay in europe?
do you know what happened when you did it originally last night? was it a movement or a serve?
you were playing maybe the best game on clay of your career this week. do you have a key of what? i mean, it was just a combination of things? it was because you were in this form? why?
it's too bad for you, but for stan it's the biggest week of his career. he's in the top 10 now.
yeah.
novak was saying earlier on in the week that lack of clay on the courts made them a little bit dangerous for players, and there have been a few injuries and withdrawals this week. your injury wasn't clay related?
(from italian) there have been several injuries this week. do you think nadal is right saying there is too much play on clay, continuous play, and that's the reason for your injuries?
you can say it could be a coincidence, but there were six players that couldn't finish their matches in barcelona and three here, plus nadal's feet. that's an awful lot of matches that didn't get finished in two tournaments. is the locker room concerned about this? do they talk but injuries? are players concerned?
you had a lot of success this week selectively attacking the net, and stepanek also showed that that can be done on clay. does that give you more confidence going into the french this year, the mixture of new height on the ball and attacking the net can be more effective?
have you had this back problem before?
could you ever imagine getting through the quarters and semis and playing two sets?
did you know beforehand that radek had a problem?
is it kind of difficult to prepare for a final when you've had short matches? in a strange way, would you have preferred to have played a complete match?
(from italian) do you think something could have been done in order to prevent this problem by not planning the olympics or the schedule so tight around the olympic games?
do you ever remember in a tournament to have two players not playing against you, or is this the first time, retiring against you?
which sort of pressure would be tomorrow on your shoulder, because you are now a big favorite? you can say whatever you want about wawrinka. everybody has a lot of respect for him, but without no.1 and no.2...
(from italian) we've seen that today stepanek wasn't well and he retired because of an injury. but on the other hand, he was here with his girlfriend. do you think the presence of someone close to you be can be an advantage or a disadvantage to you?
what's your idea about federer after your match in melbourne and he lost so many times in different situations?
you must be very, very happy. how do you explain? a great, great day of yours with a day so-so federer, a little bit of both, or how?
did you walk on to court today thinking that he's not quite the player that he has been because of the results he's had this year, and therefore your confidence level was up a little?
5-2 in the tiebreaker. you're down. are you starting to think maybe three sets?
can you compare this win to another of yours? is this the most important ever beating no.1 in the world?
your style of game is more tough physically or mentally?
for yourself.
what does this mean, the splash of joy you did at the end of the match?
the reason why?
your style of play is not really suited for play on clay. how special is it that you beat the world's no.1 on this surface, clay?
i don't think so. you disagree?
yeah?
but you prefer to play that style on clay than on other surfaces?
but do you prefer to play on clay?
you have a sort of different career compared to the other players. you started to become first a doubles player and then after the success you became good in singles. when was the moment when you realized that you could become a really good singles player? when you beat somebody or won something or when?
with roger and nadal struggling this week, do you think we're going to see a more wide open french open this year, or are those still the guys to beat?
in the annals of clay court tennis history, it's been an interesting 48 hours in terms of clay court tennis, isn't it?
what do you make of it all?
you said yesterday that one of the problems you had on clay was that you never got enough matches on it to get a feel for it. you usually go in cold, whereas now you're going in warm. reflect on it now perhaps since you're getting a few wins.
other than simply playing better this year in rome, is there something different about your approach or tactics or strategy on clay?
i suppose most people would look at a clay court event semifinal without federer and nadal as a godsend opportunity. but you've just got a semifinal and you'd rather play that one than get too carried away with it?
are we going to see more of this all-out, attacking style, or is this just against robredo?
did you see any of the james/ wawrinka match at all?
you weren't making that bit up about the cold showers?
many said that the court is very fast. djokovic said that it's in pretty bad condition. what do you think about the court?
what happened in the third set tiebreaker? how do you think the match went?
do you feel like the faster clay here has anything to do his success and the other successes of the attacking players this year?
was it the serve and volleying, or the backhand today was not working?
you looked tight in the second set when you lose the breakpoints in the first game. were you tight?
what was the problem with your backhand, roger, the shanks?
do you feel this was especially a missed opportunity with rafa out and the draw opening up?
do you have more regrets especially for certain points, some certain moments more than others, or not?
what do you think you should have done better? was it hitting the shots, your attitude?
in retrospect, do you feel you might have gone to the net more and taken it away from him?
what does this mean for your french open preparation?
are you still satisfied with your clay court game at this time?
does a loss like this affect your confidence level?
many people say that this year is the beginning of the end. what do you think about?
does his taking your rhythm away and coming to the net a lot in that match demonstrate that people playing and attacking style can succeed on clay, and is that something that you think about doing yourself at the french this year?
did you sense that he was playing particularly well when he beat ferrer particularly easy?
it was 5-2 in the tiebreak; what happened there? i mean, the first part of the match we can see he was playing very well.
what are your thoughts after?
so the frustration was building?
are there any holes in his game?
obviously frustrated now, but a decent week in reflection.
will you go there straightaway?
pleased with that, andy?
seemed to win the points that mattered.
how is your clay court game feeling after a couple matches here? starting to feel comfortable out there?
looking at the draw there, do you like what you see with no nadal now in your half?
i see blake's also in the quarters. what's your relationship on tour? do you guys train together? i know your davis cup teammates.
will be 26 this year. how much do you still think you can evolve as a player?
care to elaborate?
i am.
talk about playing in italy against an italian. is it fun to play in italy against a local? how is it different from the states?
what do you think of bolelli? how do you see him in the future?
i think the last time so many americans reached the quarters here --
when agassi won.
yeah. you and james and andre.
the question is: did you and james learn anything from andre about how to play on clay?
(from italian) first of all, please explain for those who are not too familiar with karlovic's game what it is like to receive on such a surface his serve?
do you have any complaints about your game? are you pretty happy with the way things are going so far?
as a man has just walked, is there any difference in atmosphere playing on the pietrangeli court as the old center court? any difference?
i know you wouldn't have played him until the final, but is there a slightly different atmosphere to a clay court event when rafa is not in it to when he is playing?
do you feel it was right when he was complaining about the clay court season being so tough?
yeah.
he was complaining that he had four big tournaments this year in a row every week with no week of rest between.
(from italian) you seemed more nervous than usual today in some points of the match.
how does your clay court game feel compared to a year ago? any specific areas you think you improved on?
you like the draw now at this moment?
was it as difficult as it looked?
did you have better feeling today than the first match with the ground?
with the court, sorry.
(in italian) was there a problem with the wind?
(in italian) did you feel the warmth of the crowd behind you?
(in italian.) on sunday there will be the final, and at the same time your country will be going through an election. on sunday perhaps you will be in the final at the same time. what do you think about this?
just on the match today, where does andreev's forehand sit in terms of the men's game, because it's pretty big?
how does it feel to see the name of nadal not in the draw, and did you see any of the match yesterday?
when did you first start feeling the problem with the foot?
so you were in pain when you were moving, when you were running on the court, were you?
were you close to not play? were you hesitating not to play?
you know that etienne of the atp is here. are you going to talk to him and say the same thing you told us about the calendar, what you said in barcelona? i know you have told him already, but do you think there is a chance that something can change, or you don't think anything will change?
don't trust him?
does this mean your participation in hamburg is maybe under threat because of injury?
every place where you lose you are unhappy for sure, but rome you are more unhappy than somewhere else, or not, or all the same?
(in italian.) what was your feeling inside especially being used to winning so much? was there any particular feeling that you felt losing today?
how is the groin? looked pretty bad in the first set. did it get any better?
what are your overall reflections on the match, andy?
the legs just feel heavy? what was the problem exactly?
are you just going to get a basic rub?
aside from the match points in the tenth game, you obviously felt you could still win the match from there?
generally after three clay tournaments are you kind of where you thought you'd be?
what will you do between now and hamburg?
how are you feeling out there? you looked pretty good.
the court seems to be a little slippery. is that the feeling you have?
are you still on any medication at all, or are you 100% back?
some were saying you were not trying to change too much of your game from hard courts. you're hitting a good tempo and a lot of down the line. how are you using your tactics on clay?
a lot of hard court players have had success here and say that the court plays faster than other clay courts on the european circuit. from having your match today and last year, do you feel like the court plays faster here?
you were not slipping so much the second set?
where did you learn your italian? watching italian tv?
how many languages are you able to speak?
(translated from italian.) will this put you to the test? what would be your advice to a 12-, 13-year-old wanting to become a tennis champion.
first, how do you prepare for clay court tennis differently to the hard court season after your big win in miami? and secondly, how do you think the clay in rome plays differently to other clay courts?
most people say that the clay plays faster here. is that your feeling?
the ball goes through the court faster.
and the bounce is high like a clay court, or does it bounce lower, do you think?
last year?
pleased with that?
novak talked about the speed of courts here. is it considerably quicker than in barcelona last week?
you say that over the years you've learned to develop your game on clay courts. anything specific?
after everything that happened to you here, what are your emotions when you walk through the gates? what are your thoughts?
you have time to sightsee in rome?
you're staying in europe all the way through, because you've got hamburg and then the french open?
i know that davis cup is probably the last thing on your mind right now, but the spanish camp is all of a sudden interested about where they're going to play. they signed some petition against the captain. do you have a preference?
what's your main goal for this season? are you ready to win a slam?
how did you feel today?
how much time have you had on clay for the last couple weeks?
apparently there's been some discussion in the spanish camp about where they're going to play the davis cup: madrid or down by the cost. you guys have any preference about that?
what's the thing you like the most on clay, and which of the thing you dislike the most on clay?
sam was saying in monte-carlo that he found his serve could go through the surface and he enjoyed that, and he had more time to set himself up for his shots. were you surprised that he did well in monte-carlo first visit, and does any of that relate to you?
you were saying the other day that you're prepared to stay over here the whole time through the french. in past years you've gone home between. what's different this year as far as your schedule?
that's it?
usually you go home between the two?
maybe just putting a little more into the clay court season this year?
it's must be as solid a start as you could have hoped for.
the fact that you lost twice with him on hard court and you beat him on clay means you are a better player on this surface than him, or what?
do you feel like the keys to winning on clay are different for you or the same as hard court and grass?
i think i never remember to see you do as many drop shots. is that an inspiration?
you said that you build it one shot at a time on clay, but it seems like do you think you are thinking more and going forward when you're on clay?
throughout years, do you like the game on clay better or less?
when you had this illness and all the difficulties in the beginning of the year, how did you think before coming to clay you would start a new surface?
when you you're playing people like caas, do you ever envisage rafa on the other side of the net?
what did you think when you were down 4-love in the second set?
what does it mean to you to win your fourth title here?
do you actually feel different playing a final on clay than you would, say, playing a final in miami or playing a final in australia? is there a different feeling in you?
what does it mean for you to take so many times the serve of roger federer? so many times you were leaving him one point, zero points.
are you more surprised to win a set against federer from 4-love down or win the doubles?
does it mean something for you to win the doubles? you seemed to be very aggressive. in the semifinals, calling the supervisor.
you mean for the mental, to be aggressive all the time?
looking back to your win against albert costa here, if you go back with your mind, what do you remember about that moment? far away?
how much different were you?
with the changes in the calendar next year, do you expect that you will be playing here next year? will the top players be here?
it's not going to be mandatory.
hamburg, there is still a doubt, isn't there?
how do you view that match, looking back on it?
so what do you take away? obviously you're not happy but maybe you're not so disappointed either.
the other day you said it was our job to look for when you were able to recover from 1-5 in the third set. do you remember by chance if it has ever happened that you lost a set when you were leading 4-love?
no idea?
do you feel it was your level that dropped or his level that rose?
are you going to be taking jose to rome?
could you possibly say what you think he's actually brought to your game so far, jose?
the biggest improvement do you think nadal did is on the backhand or in other things?
today you made less points on your serve than you won. that has never happened as far as i know. how do you explain it? do you think it has something to do with your serve or his return?
you seemed to be a little more relaxed and perhaps not even as disappointed with yourself as you have been in other circumstances when you lost to rafa. is that right?
maybe perhaps not quite as depressed. is that because you think your game is getting better and you are improving?
were you also tired at the end or you could have played five sets?
so how did you play, rafa? were you satisfied with the way you played?
do you feel you are getting better with every match?
and you feel more comfortable in yourself?
you didn't take a lot of risks today. was it a choice?
yes.
which part of his game is most difficult for you to play against on clay?
you are the first man to do the fourth final in a row here in monte-carlo. what does it mean for you?
you seem to have these guys in the top four falling in front of you, not finishing their matches.
was it obvious to you he was ill?
you seemed to be very free with your forehand. you're also starting to hit your backhand. you're in the groove.
comparing the other matches with nadal, which one do you think you played the best, the one you won or even rome where you didn't win but you had match points?
how do you think you match up with him tomorrow, given the way you've been playing?
on clay, would you rather play in five sets or three sets?
how much tougher is rafa on clay than on other surfaces?
why was it impossible for you today to make as many winners as you wanted?
did you find him impressive today?
you seemed to give him a lot of trouble when you were making some good angles. he didn't seem very happy. he was struggling a bit. does that give you encouragement for future matches against him?
is there anything especially you have to improve? you have the clay court season going on and then the davis cup in argentina on clay court, too.
do you think the crucial moment of the match was when you missed four times breakpoint at 4-2?
how did you feel physically today? yesterday you told us you were exhausted.
so you won't be going to barcelona? rome is next for you?
how do you feel your level overall was in this match? we had the feeling it was a very high-level match.
what was the difference after the first set? do you think he was attacking your second serves more, putting more pressure?
in the second and third set.
was there anything different about roger? look like the same guy to you?
do you think the main difference was on the physical side today?
how did you feel that was today?
do you need sometimes for a tough match at this time of year just to feel like you're in the clay court season?
you were three set points down at 5-4. at 40-15, he made a really good dropshot that you got to. can you talk about that game a little bit.
are the conditions here much slower than roland garros?
slower or faster?
same?
could you talk about playing nikolay tomorrow?
is the key to annoy you on clay to be aggressive like ferrer was the second set?
do you feel in better form not than this time last year?
the play, do you feel just as comfortable at last year?
can you describe your feeling on your first training session on clay. just after the davis cup in germany, where was it and what was your feeling to be on clay?
but you were happy?
the best match of the year 2008 of roger federer or not?
did you expect you would play so well after the first two matches?
is your game lifted with this match? has it come up a bit since the past couple of matches?
was it especially nice beating him after he'd beaten you the last two times?
still he's a player who has beaten you eight times. so should give you a little more satisfaction.
how do you explain the difference between the way you played today and the way you played on wednesday?
how long does it take you to get back into the full swing of it on clay?
seemed like another very composed performance from you. can you talk about how you played.
do you have to adjust when you're playing someone who isn't a clay court specialist? he must look very different to most people you play on clay.
it seemed quite easy. are you ready for a big clash now?
do you think the fact that it's on clay makes the job slightly easier in any way?
were you surprised by his reaction today? as you said, he played a big match against nalbandian.
that looked like a very difficult match. can you just talk about it for us.
do you think it was your level that changed a lot through the match or his level?
how do you explain your up-and-down? is it physically? is it your typical clay game?
both of you had problems with serve. i think 16 breaks of serve. any particular reason? what was happening with the serving?
do you enjoy playing on clay? what do you like, if you like it?
now you are in the semifinals against a spanish player. what is your opinion?
if you play nadal, you just beat him in miami. do you think it can help you or it's totally different?
do you enjoy playing against him?
you think you're maybe tired mentally or physically or both?
you're going to change your schedule for the rest of the year and maybe play less?
when you were serving for it, were you just sort of trying to put out of your mind the fact that you were about to beat the french no.1 on red clay in europe?
you beat the french open champion, the french no.1 on clay. have you surprised yourself?
will you tell other american players to come next year here?
do you think they will?
you only played the french open as a junior, what was it, quarters?
then last year. are you looking forward to it after this?
is it something special to play at that particular tournament, maybe off-the-court sort of things?
you were at a tournament. you said there was nothing to see, so you didn't have to do any tourism.
at the french open you feel obligated?
you don't have to worry about it?
in which way do you say clay suits your game?
did you sense his frustration? i think there was one game where you saved seven breakpoints. did you sense he was getting frustrated?
did you get the impression he maybe underestimated you?
how did you feel that was for you?
did you feel like it was a step up from yesterday for you?
when you haven't played on clay for a while, does it always feel automatic for you? does it feel very natural to play on it again?
when you came back from hard courts, can you talk about the feeling the first time you stepped back on clay after such a long time? was it a big pleasure for you to feel the ball, to be sliding again?
do you think people perhaps don't realize that it is tough for you? they just go, 'rafa, it's clay, he'll be fine.' they don't realize you have to adjust, as well.
give us your verdict on the match, andy.
can you just explain what happened, why the umpire didn't check that mark?
when he is striking the ball so consistently well and deep and hard, how tough is it to get into a rhythm and get into the match?
do you notice anything different about him to when he played in indian wells, key biscayne? is it a confidence thing?
talk about the progress you feel you've made in the last three matches, or since you got here.
have you decided what you may do next week?
have you been in touch with jamie baker?
do you know anything?
last year nadal was dominating the clay season and federer was no.2, let's say, on clay. would you say that now djokovic has a chance to become the no.2, to overcome federer at least on clay or not?
i'm sure the colleagues of mine here, the british, know which soccer team you support in your country. can you tell me?
if you can say the first quality of djokovic, like player or athlete, which one is it?
did that feel a bit better today? more comfortable?
do you think in some ways now that yesterday might actually have helped you a little bit, just to have that much time on court, to work through some stuff?
did it play on your mind at all overnight, the way you played yesterday?
do you think that's a different kind of plan than you might have created when you were basically on your own?
how do you see yourself now?
yourself.
do you feel honestly better, more confident every day?
how did you think he played today compared with the previous match against him in miami? did he improve?
is there something you can do better on clay today?
when you are trying to be patient but also aggressive, like you've just said, how do you pick the right moment to change?
how did this match compare with your previous wins against andy?
are you pretty optimistic about this short clay season from what you've seen so far?
is there anything special for you when you play at the french open - maybe not the tennis, but the ambiance?
grass is the kingdom of roger federer. clay is the kingdom of rafa nadal. what about you? do you think you have more chances on clay to gain some points in comparison with federer? do you think clay is better for you or federer?
you and andy very much matched each other in the first couple years coming out of the juniors in terms of rankings. on today's evidence, you look a long way ahead of him. do you feel that or do you think he is better than it showed today?
obviously when you think about your game, do you feel he doesn't do himself justice against you when he plays you?
how can you comment on the fact that this tournament in monte-carlo in the quarterfinals will play 7 of the top 10 players from the atp list, if i'm not mistaken?
no.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 9. only andreev is out of the top 10.
yes. this is one of the strongest quarterfinals.
do you have any memories of the french open that you like or some you didn't like?
but your memories about the italian open are not that good?
he's a very talented player, obviously. you must be very pleased to have come through that relatively comfortably?
were you pleased how good it felt straightaway, that you felt so good on the clay straightaway? good for the confidence?
do you think about all the next weeks of all these titles you have to hope to defend?
when you think of roland garros, not winning the titles, but when you think of roland garros, what do you think of? what is your best memories besides three titles?
what do you think about the reduction of the season on clay? you expressed yourself about that.
did you see roger's game? if yes, what was your feeling?
what do you think about the clay court? it will be a three-player battle, with novak you and roger, or do you think other players can fight also?
it couldn't have been better today?
how about the pain in the back?
weren't you tense when you arrived here with what happened in davis cup, your back? did that put pressure on you?
are you reassured about your level of game after miami?
and what do you think about your next round? he's a very good player on clay.
guy forget is arriving this evening. are you ready to speak with him? he wants to see you.
mica said that maybe you agreed not to say anything to the press during that meeting at davis cup. what do you think about that? apparently he wasn't very pleased that you spoke.
how did you get out of that one?
was there a bit of fatigue after last week, or why do you think it wasn't such a good day for you today?
when you went down 5-1 in the third, you thought it was almost over or you still had hope?
do you remember if you ever won a time after 1-5 in your career?
what does that tell you about what you have to do tomorrow?
do you have the feeling that if you had in front of you a player more consistent than ramirez hidalgo today you would have lost or not?
what made you more worried about your own game? what wasn't working as well as you would have liked?
and in terms of confidence, is there anything different this year compared to last year because of all these reasons you mentioned or not?
then you win three awards, as well.
you won fans' favorite and humanitarian of the year.
what were the three today?
happy with those three?
we just had a british player who lost 54 matches in a row. had he lost 55 matches in a row, he would have set a world record for defeats.
what would you say to someone who is in that kind of situation, losing matches week after week after week? would you say, keep going?
we have already.
do you give him credit for carrying on?
have you a arrived after what happened in estoril? the physical problem is gone or is still there?
you played bolelli in miami and here. what is the difference? do you think he's a better player on hard court or clay or the same? do you see any difference?
in miami --
why?
this season has seen a few upset results with roger and a few new faces coming on the scene. do you think his start to the season is a sign he's maybe losing his edge a little bit or is it just a temporary thing?
yes.
let's talk then about davydenko.
davydenko is stronger on clay or hard court?
let's say you have to pick a surface where you want to play the match of your life. which surface will you pick?
you have to play three clay court masters series in four weeks this month; four tournaments in four weeks if you play next week. what do you think about that? is that too much?
can you imagine playing the four weeks on clay courts with the same difficulties you had last year in rome against nadal in the semifinal, three hours on the court, very tough match?
you say you cannot choose a surface, but could you choose a tournament?
one tournament that you like more than the others?
roland garros?
more than us open?
did that feel like unfinished business, winning that match?
did he surprise you at all the way he played? looking at the stats, he came into the net more than you did.
are you excited to be in the clay season, now that it's underway?
does that make you more hungry when roland garros comes around to make a bigger impression?
in terms of tennis, what do you like the most on clay?
more thinking here maybe?
you look smart. on clay, maybe you can more use that?
you look very smart.
so on clay you can more use this technique or tactic?
what is your percentage of fitness then would you say now after the virus you've had, not many matches in recent times? would you consider yourself a hundred percent fit for clay court tennis?
over the last week or so?
given that you didn't play last year in paris, and you injured yourself the year before, do you have any pleasant thoughts when you think about going to play the french open, in general?
when you look at the 12 months since you last played djokovic, you've clearly had one or two injury issues, have you been surprised at the amount of progress that he's made in that time, the last year?
do you remember playing him much on clay as a junior?
yes.
does the pain in your back explain the first set?
at 4-3 you asked for the trainer.
until 5-love you only won two points.
is it becoming a nightmare, losing twice 6-love?
you did lose love-love in hamburg.
and how is your back now?
what is your schedule now?
you're still without a coach?
what didn't work out with rodolphe?
so who are you hitting with before a match?
that looked like on paper a potentially difficult first match. you must be pleased to have got through it so comfortably?
what are the things at this point in the clay court season in your game you're particularly focused on?
some time ago you announced that you wanted to be no.1. in australia you beat federer. do you still have the same goal for the end of the year?
what is the best thing that's happened to you since you won the australian open?
you mentioned roger. what did you make of his start to the season? is there an apparent weakness there or is it a case of a blip or do you sense his level may be dropping slightly?
the crowd likes you very much because not only do you play great tennis, but also you have the quality of being able to have fun and joke on the court. but now you seem more calm. is it because you really want to focus and be the best in tennis? do you think it's sort of a better discipline?
good start to a clay court season.
do you think that's the sort of core of it: to know when to attack and when to move in? i mean, you have the game for clay. don't you feel you have the game for clay?
do you think the stuff you're working on here, the development of your game, is going to be useful on all the other surfaces, as well?
how natural do you find your movement on clay, sliding into shots and things?
alex made the point yesterday to us that it's important that people don't rush, that you don't rush, that you take your time and get the game in the right position. youngsters are notoriously impatient. are you aware of it, that it's important you take it step by step and it's going to be a process?
yesterday alex said, in fact, the art of clay is sometimes you accept to play some bad shots, and that you were so demanding with yourself, you didn't accept that even when you were training, to accept to play some bad shots sometimes in a point, just to accept that.
and you enjoyed that?
you have kind of sweet and sour memories of volandri when you were playing some superb tennis against him last year, then it all went horribly wrong.
you said yesterday you didn't expect much from this tournament because of the lack of preparation. was it the case today?
but your opponent didn't have much preparation either.
but it was a good test. you played a good match.
and you would have needed a "more forgiving" net for you?
did you believe you had chances when you were coming back?
after the davis cup you heard that richard's father started asking for noah as a captain. llodra said you had agreed not to speak to the press. what is your position about all that?
do you believe losing in this first round is a good thing for you; you can rest now?
but you would have needed to have a break after the united states?
but now you can do your preparation next week?
are you playing a tournament next week?
in barcelona?
how do you feel mentally?
is it not too much emotion in one year to play every time in a tournament and you have to say good-bye, make a succession of good-byes? it's not difficult for you?
in the paper you explained the greatest moments were really important for you but also the suffering moments or difficult moments were maybe more important for you in your life. can you explain that?
were you asking for a wildcard also in rome? did you get it?
rome, you didn't ask?
speaking of roland garros, besides winning the three titles, what are some of your best memories of roland garros?
did you ever have a bad memory of anything at roland garros? anything bad ever happen?
what was the problem? was it a warning or something?
you were the last one to beat roger federer in paris since nadal. how did you make it? what do you think about the confrontation between roger federer and nadal for three years? what is the evolution of the confrontation?
how did you make it three years ago to beat roger in three sets?
the match of today, for instance, is it somehow embarrassing for you because you think, years ago i would have played much better, i could compete? do you feel somehow you are disappointing the crowd that would like to see you competing at the same level of your opponent or not?
aren't you afraid in a way that in paris you will have to play best-of-five?
do you think the demanding effort to play on clay, on hard court, on grass, makes that your body suffers and there are more and more injuries in tennis? you were the no.1 who had to stop his career because of that.
were you sad that this is the end or you're happy this is the way you're ending your career?
do you think it would be better not to do these last three tournaments and lose badly and ruin your image?
no breaks of serve.  no breakpoints.  strange final, but good outcome for you.
you said yesterday you wanted to serve well, and you did that.  any adjustments that you did to your game just to take him on?
what do you consider to be your biggest weapon, because service was important for you as well?
have you ever had better preparation before a grand slam?  apart from get valuable court time, it's been hot here and it will be in melbourne.
what are your expectations next week?
what will you do you to recharge your batteries?
are you going to take the trophy with you?
that was kind of -- to lose 7-6, 7-6 and you had one more point that tursunov, it's a strange way to lose a match.
yeah.
was it down to nerves in the end for you?
nevertheless, quite a successful week for you?
what sort of goals have you got for the year?
do you feel like a top 50 player now?
any aspects of this match that you can take to the australian open?
big learning curve this week.  what was the biggest thing you learned?
does that make it exciting?
you go into next week with sort of less pressure from this week, or does it raise people's expectations of you?
how did you feel after that match?  take a bit out of you?
and your form in that match, were you happy with the way you played?
did you watch some of previous semifinal from the players' lounge, the guccione match?
your impressions of the left-handed serve.
you've never met him before.
did you get much time off?  what did you do after your time off after davis cup?
are you also aware that you are the first -- the last russian to win here was alex metreveli in 1972.
do you think the crowd is going to be a factor?  it's fair to assume that they're not going to support you.
can you shut it out?
it's a real achievement to get to the final, but is there a sense of satisfaction to get this far this early in this the season?
looked pretty tough out there.
after the high of today what'll you do tonight?  go somewhere quiet?  what will you do to refocus for tomorrow?
are there lessons learn from adelaide that you've taken into this final?
you said at the start of the tournament that you thought you had the game to worry anybody.  do you have that belief now?
what's the best thing this week's given you?  confidence, or what is it?
talk about your likely opponents for the final.  have you played them before, or what have you seen of them as a spectator?
the crowd really seemed to be cheering you on.
assuming you eventually do, after this tournament, break into the top 100, can you talk a little bit about how getting into that two digit ranking affords you more opportunities and what that means for your own tennis career this year.
have you had any chance to think about your first-round opponent in melbourne at all?
you've had your doubters over the last few weeks, which is pretty well documented.
just gets better and better, doesn't it?
were you struggling for your rhythm early, or was it more that he was returning to so well that you felt like you were pushing for a bit more on your serve?
so what's your recollection of the volley you played on match point?
how does this series of wins compare to adelaide last year?  is this your best two back-to-back wins, do you feel, in your career?
did that touch volley that you made, did that really give you a big boost to get through that second set and take control of the third set?
that make a bit of a difference?
did the crowd help?  i know just you and only you out on the court, but does the crowd help?
what do you know about stepanek?
a match like this with berdych, does this help your nerves in tough games?
is there a reason why things are working so well?
what sort of training were you doing during that period?
it's obviously something you felt that you needed to do?
so probably bemused that newc's comments maybe came at the wrong time.
you're bound to run into newc at the australian open.  have you thought about that?
how much will this help you, having had such a good week here already, going into the australian open next week?
what are your thoughts on the match?
some 50/50 calls, couple of line calls, maybe that controversial half volley of his --
do you think it was pretty dubious?
chris wants to get into the top 50 this year.  do you think that's achievable for him?
have you been happy with the umpiring decisions in the two matches here?
you sound pretty disappointed.
are you happy with the balls?  a lot of players are complaining about the balls becoming heavier and fluffy.
richard gasquet said that the balls are bigger than what he's used to and it favors the stronger players.  do you think that it's true?
what do you think of the overall standard of umpiring?
what do you think can be done about that?
why do you think the standard isn't what it used to be years ago?
australian open, looking forward that now.  what is your prep now?  will you go down early or stay at home?
so certainly not pushing the panic button just yet for the tilt?
do you feel like you've had enough matches to go in well-prepared for the australian open?
do you think there's anything that you can improve from now on?
playing best-of-five sets in a grand slam a lot different than best-of-three here?
sunk in yet, mate, what's happened?
what does this win rank from all those other ones?
at what stage did you feel like you could really get his measure in this match?
with some of the criticism from tennis legends, do you feel any vindication kind of doing this today?
the sixth point the second set tiebreak lleyton was questioning whether you got that ball back.  talk us through that shot.  did you feel it was all right?
so just hit it off your frame a little bit?
it's the first time you played together in battle, in a match.  what was it like playing a compatriot knowing that you're getting him fired up and getting him stirred up?
seeing him fired up, did that make you feel good, or was that a bit scary?
what are your thoughts on tomas berdych?
have you played him?
what are your thoughts on the match today?
are you looking forward to playing gucc tomorrow?
have you practiced with him a lot?
did you feel like your game progressed today from before?
on another subject, roger federer is now going to go into the australian open without any match practice.  do you think that will make him more vulnerable?
bernard is playing qualifying for the open now.  what sort of challenge does that pose to him?  you did that ten years ago.
what sort of advice would you give him?
was it difficult to regain composure after losing serve in the first set with the line call and all?
were you happy with your serve today?
how did you think the new surface will affect rafael nadal's prospects at the australian open, if at all?  there was a feeling it was a little bit on the slower side previously.
on your first match point today you came in and volleyed on his serve.  is that the kind of thing you've been practicing with rochey?
but you volleyed well.  why is it so much against your instinct to do?
does the racquet technology affect it, the way you serve and volley?
so do you feel like you actually are getting a bit more comfortable doing that over the past few months?
so it's still something you have to think about?
have you been surprised at accusations that the cricket team play it too hard?
yeah, play it too hard.
are you hoping lleyton gets through so you can test your credentials?
what's it been like when you practiced against him?
how do you think your game would stack up against lleyton?
so it's an another nothing-to-lose sort of attitude?
you must have been thrilled when you saw you were going against another spaniard first round here.
and good results against all of them.
how do you feel like you played today?  do you feel like you stepped it up?
18 aces today.  it's a pretty big donation.
do you have any links to juvenile diabetes?
just want to help out?
that was a nice way to start the year.
tell us about it.
james said you played very intelligently and you have lovely hands.
yeah.  he said you're a good player and you played intelligently and you have lovely hands.  what do you see as your key today?
james almost thought the courts played rather slow.  what was your impression?
you're 35 now.
quite a bit older than you.  how do you approach each year on the circuit?  what's your mindset?
so you haven't bit the bullet yet and said, this will be my last year.  you just take it as it comes.
it's your 16th or 17th australian open, isn't it?
and you had a quarterfinal two years ago.
it never becomes boring or mundane?
disappointed we know, peter.  can you just talk you through that last set?
i was going to say the class of some of those shots just shows you why people do break so often.
generally speaking, how do you feel your form is going into the australian open?
is there anything you put that down to in particular, or is it the guys that you're up against?  what is it that's causing that?
how does this fit into your australian open preparations?
did you dwell on results, or do you try to analyze it and move on or just move on as soon as you leave the court?
are you doing doubles here?
will you practice here or go to melbourne?
you talked about match practice.  is there any way you can replicate that?
i won't say you exactly predicted it yesterday, but you certainly gave an indication that it would be a difficult match, and it certainly panned out that way.
any aftermath from the davis cup?  a little bit of letdown to get back up again?
did the court play slower today than when you were hitting up?
where would that adjustments be?
how will you spend the rest of the week?
you took off your cap, and then you pulled three aces out of your hat.  how did you do that?
yeah.
should we name it maybe serbian wells now?
what happened in the second set, novak?  what was the struggle?
how does it feel when you've won the first grand slam of the year, now you've won the first masters of the year.  pretty impressive start.  why do you think it's suddenly coming together for you?
what would you consider for after this fabulous start a successful year for you?  what would you consider a successful year?
do you think that this huge professional success changed you as a person at all?
what's more dangerous for you in the situation like  playing a guy who has a big game and throwing your rhythm out and end points quickly or a guy who can stay up there and grind you with like a rafael?
if someone had told you when you and ivanovic were practicing together as kids that you would win back-to-back titles of this size on the same day, what would you say?
what does all this success do for your country?
apparently you won first two major tournaments of the year, and we've got players like mardy fish and tsonga beating federer and nadal.  do you think there's more equality in the top 10 now or even in the top 20 as far as players go?
you don't think people are tired of you winning everything early?
going into australia, roger was still the favorite to win the tournament.  you win it.  so you come into indian wells this time and it could have been argued at the start of the tournament that maybe you're the favorite, so was it a different type of pressure for you to come through here and actually win it?
there are some players who play the sport who i think would probably die rather than give a point away.  i mean, you gave him a second -- you gave him a first serve somewhere during the match today.  that's fairness, as well.  it was appreciated by the crowd, as well.  did you sense that as you were...
would you be kind to tell us little bit more about the tennis center that your family is building in the heart of your country and the city of kragujevac, please?
as has been mentioned, you've had this great start.  in your own mind, do you think you're the best player in the world now?
you've struggled through some hard times growing up, things like that.  have you allowed yourself any luxuries since you've become a big player and obviously making a lot of money and having a lot of success?
at 4-2 in the second set you had control.  can you tell us kind of what happened to maybe lose that set and how you regained control in the third?
although it's a late hour, do you think there's some celebrating going on back home in serbia?
you said that you don't want to get, i guess, pulled into the political situation at home, but you gave that video speech last month and also, i guess, what happened the last couple of days ago with milorad cavic and getting banned from the swimming championship.
there were some fans up in the upper deck today with flags and everything, and one had a serbia -- kosovo with serbia banner, and they were asked to take it down.  how do you feel about that?
well played.
did you think that was going to be that easy, and how well did you think you played?
where does this huge confidence that you have this year coming from?  i think this is the biggest difference in your game in the last couple months.
how much better do you think you've gotten this year so far?
this is a maybe/if question:  have you played mardy fish before, and how have you done?
you beat him?
is that the only time?
it's 5-1 in the second.  does that surprise you?
let's say fish does close it out.  would you feel a bit more confident playing mardy fish than -- not saying you wouldn't feel confident playing roger, but more confident play fish than playing roger?
three different serbians in three different finals this year in indian wells.
it's only the been a year.  are you saying you're bored of the serbian success?
you served for the match at 6-5 in the third set.  did you expect to close it out at that point?  it had been a pretty tight match.
were you at all surprised about how well fish has been playing?  i mean, he had struggled the last few years, and he's having a pretty good start to the year.  was anything out there about him surprising to you?
about you, he just said -- of course, he has to play federer next.  he said, i just beat a guy who beat him, meaning federer, the past two times.  i feel like i feel i can beat anybody right now.  do you feel he's right in that?  do you feel that fish is playing so well right now that he could beat anybody?
would you mind giving us your thoughts about the semifinals here?
you know, it's hard to beat federer any time.  but how much harder do you think it will be for fish since federer didn't have to play today?  he had a day off.
how would you evaluate your performance here in this tournament?
2007 didn't seem to start out well for you, but then you really turned it around in the second half of the season and have been playing very well so far in 2008.  what's made the difference for you?
were you looking forward to playing roger again and maybe beating him a third time in a row?
do you have some insight or some secrets on how that's done?
would you like to share them or something?
so you really think you could beat him again?  you're looking forward to it?
well done, mardy.  was that one of the most satisfying wins of your career?
did it feel like maybe you lost it when those two match points didn't go your way?
mardy, why here, why now?
what's it been, massage or stretching?
3-4, 15-40; 4-5, 15-40 losing match points, dropping serve.  what's going through your mind?
he comes out and serves for the match and you're a break down.  you looked like you were done then.
when you and kelly were talking about your struggles in tiebreaks earlier this week, what did he pick up on?  what did he pass along to you?
when a guy has done the things you have in tennis - i'm thinking of your play on the davis cup team and things of that order - is it humbling to have to accept a wildcard?
you have a wildcard into this event, right?
how did you get into this tournament if it wasn't on a wildcard?
if you compare this tournament to cincinnati or the olympics ranking-wise, these last three matches are better quality players for the most part.  so can we say this might be your best run ever?
does it seem a little bit unfair that you play a match like that, your reward is to play the world's best player, and he's had a day off?
do you think you'll have enough left in the tank judging on how you feel today?
you mentioned your forehand has improved, and it's pretty obvious to me.  how did that happen?  did you do a lot of work on it?
can you talk about the company you're in in the semifinals?  it's the top three players in the world.  you're the cinderella guy?
you were talking about crowd support.  everyone loves a cinderella.  that has to be huge?
it also must be nice to be the last american standing at a big tournament.
yeah.
judging by matches you've played against roger in the past, what sort of mindset do you have to take into it?  do you have to play the way you have already this week?  do you feel you've got to do more because it's roger?
did you think that two weeks ago?
that you could beat high quality players, 7-6 in the third?
is it a deliberate change in your strategy or technique between the way it is now than, say, a year or two ago, or just experience making things get better?
you'll be entering middle age as a tennis player pretty soon.  is there a maturity issue at play here when you look at the game now?
how much credit should kelly jones have for what you're doing?
do i understand that you worked with kelly previously and you've gone back to him?
how much of success against top guys, or just even being a top 10, top 20 player is actually loving the fight, committing to the fight, not worrying whether you're going to go out there three hours, 7-6 in the third, dropping match points, the ability to keep yourself in those matches?
trainers name?
so what is it about you in olympic years?
what is it about you and olympic years?
your reaction to the final point of the first-set tiebreak was as though you kind of won the championship.  i mean, that was probably the point of the championship.  how important was that in the overall outcome?
why was he giving you so much trouble to start with?  was the problem with you or him or both?
in the tournament statistics they said you had about 31 unforced errors that first set.  did you feel like you were maybe battling yourself a lot that first set?
do you regard him as legitimate challenger perhaps for a place in the top 20?
thoughts about the next round?  you know, both players, who you might play.
can you talk about playing rafa last year in the finals and how that became a great learning experience for you?  because you got him again the following tournament.
do you think you're a little bit hard done by the timing of the umpire's call against you today?
so maybe the previous changeover they should, say you're taking a wee bit too much time here.
when you practice with james, what about his game has impressed you?
how do you think you stack up mentally against james in terms of the match toughness?
yeah.
it's like a boxing match playing somebody who gives 100 percent like you do.  how difficult and how challenging to play somebody like that?
can you just talk about, seemed like the first set you were just kind of battling those unforced errors.  second set i think they had you with only four unforced errors in the second set.
have you looked at the statistics you just played?
you hit 41 winners to his 12, which should affirm what you just said.  in the first set you were serving at 5-6, 30-40, and a rally ensued.  you interrupted play to indicate that you're preparing to issue a challenge.  when you do that, don't you have to be damn sure that the ball is out?  i mean, that the challenge went against you, and you lost the game.
can you go through that game when you were up love-40 on his serve at the end of the first set.  what happened after that?
first point you missed a service return and then you made four successive errors.
you might give us your thoughts about the next match for nadal against djokovic.  what are your thoughts?
are you planning on sticking around or going to miami?
can you evaluate your run through this tournament and where you are now with your game?
the other night you were kind enough to talk about presidential candidate, barack obama and about how you endorse him and share your values.  i would kindly ask you to expand a little bit more on that side.  you said that you read his book.  have you ever met him?
supposing, assuming that he might invite you, let's say to rally for him, would you do that?
did you think at all about the match in melbourne during this match?
can you talk about what happened from 5-2 in the third set ahead?
seemed like at times you were playing well defending, and then you would go offense aggressive and then defending, then offense.  talk about how you were feeling mentally and what your approach was to the match?
looking back on the australian match going into this match, did you feel like it was a chance for you to really even the score with him?  did you look at it as a very important match?
today, yes.
were you nervous?
in australia you never got into the match.  he just kind of flew away from you.  today it seemed like you were working hard just to stay in there to push him.
so talk about the mental game at the end of third set.  he's obviously a very talented player, australian open final.  but you have the three grand slam championships, the three french opens, many titles.  at the end it looked like you were mentally stronger than he was.
in australia you said, let's see if tsonga can maintain his level.  do you feel like he's in the top 10 players at this point?
more specifically, do you think he could get to the very top with the top two or three players, like you and roger and novak, that level?
jo.
yeah.
are you saying that he needs to win matches like he lost today to be at that level?
tsonga expressed he was a little disturbed about how long you took with the serve, and he said he complained to the umpire.  did you hear the complaint, and does that ever effect you when players complain about how much time you take on your serve?
did you hear him complaining during the match?
just talk a little bit about either blake or gasquet.
can you also talk about what you remember about playing against james here two years ago?
yeah, i believe so.
why is it so hard to convert those chances against james when you're able to do it against other players?
yesterday after his match, roger said he liked playing french players who i think show a great variety, more than the spanish players who get the ball back.  comment on the difference between the spanish and the french style and roger's comment.
so you think there's a lot of variety within the spanish players, not just a tremendous baselines, but a lot variety within the spanish players?
two of the biggest back-to-back wins of your career maybe.
lleyton, getting lleyton in a third-set tiebreak is pretty tough, mardy.  he's pretty tough.
so you played first sets good.  well, you couldn't serve it out, it wasn't a great game, but you managed to get your way through it.  second set he kind of climbs on you.  what do you think going into the third set?
james was saying more or less you're a confidence player.  obviously that's a big element for anyone at this level.  but do you feel like you are a confidence player, that you really need that to bring out your best stuff?
can you talk a little bit about your next round?
on your notepad.  what kind of bug is it?  (laughter.)
have you started entertaining the idea of winning this tournament?
the two americans still here in the tournament pretty much from the same area.
okay.  what's the scene like down there?  is it an advantage having, you know, a world class player?
does that push you a little bit, having the elite level of players there?
you worked with kelly before, and then you worked with some other coaches and came back to kelly.  what's it like when you come back to a guy you've worked with before?  is that dynamic different, or...
not to be a wise guy, but let me put you on the spot:  mardy fish to win the pacific life open:  deal or no deal?
you seemed a little frustrated with some of the officiating in tonight's game, match.  comment on that a little bit.  it seemed at one point it almost could even affect your game a little bit.
do you think bashing a ball up into the stands is like a no-harm, who-does-it-hurt kind of situation?
yeah.
you feel the same way about cracking a racquet?
what is the level of the confidence at this point of the tournament comparing at the same time in australia and getting close to that?  are you any better than then?
was it tough to wait for your match to come on?  because the match before you was three hours.  how tough is it to stay prepared?
you were very careful to talk about the future, but if you can just allow yourself a little bit considering the australian, it's already better than last season.  do you feel this is your season?
talk about the next round and what you know about your opponent.  i don't know anything about him.
i happen to note you're out there on the lawn having some fun, kicking what we call a soccer ball here.  how would you describe yourself as a soccer player or football player?
yeah, i know that.
and of the other tennis players, who is the best football player around?
serbia has also a wonderful basketball and soccer team as well.
yeah, football.  thank you.  but what it's very difficult to buy a tennis racquet now in belgrade, and that is thanks to you and, of course, and jelena, ana, and janko.  can you elaborate a little bit on that?  what does that mean for the country?
tsonga obviously lost a really close match against nadal today.  do you expect him to be playing at a level for the rest the year where he can challenge the really top guys?
did that self-belief kick in for you here last year, or was it before that?
what do you take from rafa's performance today coming back from 5-2?
this issue about believing -- a couple years ago it was just nadal and federer.  now you're in that group.  there are really three people they're talking about.  the differences between you nadal and federer, on any given day, is the believing the biggest part of it, who believes the best that day and doesn't lose their confidence?
andy murray was just in here talking a little bit about his actual dreams and how that sort of helped him in his own thinking.  have you had some interesting dreams about tennis?  i know it's an unusual question, but i wanted it ask it?
i was talking about like dream dreams.  like when you wake up in the morning and you're winning roland garros.
literal dreams when you're sleeping.
i was just looking up on the internet and your karaoke at the french open was very popular.  can you talk about that?  also, i was talking to lleyton hewitt and svetlana kuznetsova, and they made it sound like they were tricked into it.  can you talk about how that all came about?  the "i will survive"?
what will you sing this year?
thought about it?
there's a top 10 list and you were no.1.  who are the other players?
could you have done it without taking off your shirt and still been no.1?
who did you like of the ones that you did see?  which ones impressed you?
must be excited to beat a guy like nikolay and to do it so convincingly tonight.
these courts are allegedly pretty slow, though.  it's not easy to play and attack every return, right?
so it's also a matter of getting off to a good start, huh?
so it must have been nice not to face andy roddick?
so lleyton isn't a completely dissimilar player from davydenko, but he's got mentally little bit better resum, right?  backhand is tough?
so you're going to have to attack.  you're going to have to come in.  the approach shots have to be terrific against him, huh?
olympics this year.  andy pulling out kind of opens up some opportunities.  can you give us your thoughts about the olympics and maybe getting back there and trying to do one better?
you still sound like you are a up in the air, mardy.
can you share some of your other memories, other highlights of the whole experience?
who are some of the people in other sports that you met at the olympics that you still keep in touch were?
what do you think it would be like if roger federer hung out in the village in beijing?
how you feeling?
what do you make of the match just now?
did the nerves go away in the second set?
when you look at the bracket and you see nadal a couple wins away, do you say, hey, i want to get there?
been a good week for you in that respect.  good to get in a couple wins?
you had a hard time holding your serve first set, and then pretty easy first two games in the second set.  what adjustment did you make?
you had him up love-30 at 2-4 and kind of overhit on two shots.  did you feel the pressure to break back or what was going through you your mind?
last year and lately, momentum has kind of been going, you've been gaining momentum.  what are you better at right now that you weren't a couple years ago?
that first win last august, how big a deal was that?
did that feel like the biggest match of your career so far today?
just sort of managing your emotions, how is it different to go out and play a guy like nadal and you feel nervous and you have nothing to lose versus maybe playing the finals of the australian open juniors when you're supposed to win?
but at some point you're thinking, i can't win this match.  i just need to win a game and then i'm going to get into it?
what do you learn from playing an opponent like that?
did you find the difference between somebody like that and somebody who's at a lower level?
is it a kind of arrogance or...
swagger?
you were pleased to break into the top 100 last year.  what would make you pleased this year?  what are your goals?
you and john and sam querrey are part of an exciting new generation.  who do you think has more of an upside potential between your friends, sam and john?
the crowd definitely seems supportive out there.  do you feel that when you're out there, and is that kind of the case wherever you go?
people have kind of known who you are for a while now and there's been expectations.  do you sense the people are rooting for you, kind of?
one of the great tennis centers in america is an hour or so from atlanta, the university of georgia tennis center.  do you ever go out there to play with diaz and those guys?
how do those fans out there compare to the us open fans?
so the winning streak was broken.  was it mostly him, or was it you weren't hitting the ball the way you wanted to?
he can be tough, too, andy, huh?  he had a reasonably slow start to the year, but he was due for a good match.
did you return like you wanted to, or was he serving that well?
now you got a good amount of time off with miami.  you don't play doubles, so what's the plan?
this isn't a flip question, andy, but good to be home next weekend for the start of the ncaas?
how many times have you had a match point be a net cord?
it's happened before, though?
sorry to interrupt the flow here, but what's your thoughts on coaches in the near future?
is it kind of strange dean in the other camp?
some parting thoughts maybe on davis cup?  seem pretty pumped up to see you guys, the french?
yeah.
is there something about haas that give you a little bit of trouble?
you had ups and downs now and then, and because you're such a vet, you seem to handle it now to come back after a downer or you get back up again.
is that accurate?
do you think that haas still has the potential to come back to the top 10?
judging by the fact that you pulled out of the olympic team to concentrate on the us open, do you have any attitude towards the french open and the clay court season, something that you don't concentrate on as much as wimbledon?
i'm just talking about the preparation for a major event.
like wimbledon is a priority, i imagine, as is the us open.
does the french open clay court season not favor as highly in your priorities?
you mentioned that everyone's going to have an awful match every once in a while.  seems to be kind of a top tier right now in tennis with nadal and federer and djokovic.  is it eating at you a little bit about you're on the outside looking in a little bit?
andy, this is about as calm after a loss you've been in quite some time, at least in my memory.  does that mean your confidence is at an all-time high?
you got sort of ambushed in here the other day.  any lingering effects of that could have affected your play?  (laughter.)
weirdest press conference ever?
i know there's been some.
exactly what did tsonga say that caught your attention?  i missed it.
respect them?
so are press conferences more fun or more of a pain in the neck for you?
it's part of the fun.
happy with the way you recovered after an a little bit much a sluggish start?
were you aware he had beaten tim in the first round of miami about four or five years ago?
does experience help when you're in that situation and somebody's playing very well against you and you're sort of a bit taken aback?
is there a sense too that not only do you know that you have a good three-set record but your opponent knows you've got a good three-set record as well.  so probably in the second they maybe just press a bit and try and do things that they wouldn't...
what were the conditions like out there?  we've seen you practicing on the main stadium courts the last few days.  what was it like out there with the wind?
you've got ivo karlovic in the next round.  what are your thoughts on him?
i know it's difficult for a 6'10" guy to sneak in anywhere, but he's kind of snuck into the top 20 without anyone taking much notice about it.  is there more to his game now than simply that huge serve?  has his all-court game not taken on a little bit of new lease for life?
do you think the future of the game is in really tall players like him, or maybe not necessarily so?
how would you describe the way that the british fans have embraced you?  do you feel any added pressure to win for them?
are you interested to kind of see this week what federer looks like?
on the court.
i mean with the illness.
sounds like you think he's kind of held to a different standard because he's been so dominant.
there's an expression in english that rumors of my demise were greatly exaggerated, or the rumors of somebody's demise were greatly exaggerated.  there have been rumors about you and shoulder and maybe things looked pretty bad.
anyway, you are obviously not about to leave the game.
what do you do to make sure the shoulder stays in as good of condition as possible?
you were hitting to his backhand quite a bit.  it's obviously his weaker wing.  he's obviously made lot of progress over the last 18 months, two years off that wing.  can you talk about the improvements he's made on that side?
how did the new coaching arrangement come about, and what are you hoping to get out of it?
will he travel full time?
when somebody like andy starts throwing racquets and talking to themself and stuff, does that kind of go into your head as, you know, you're into his head now or...
in most countries now, they're working really hard to discover juniors who are going to get to the top.  does germany have an aggressive program for young players coming up?
sounds like you kind of answered this, but obviously andy roddick is an emotional player when he gets on the court.  would you say he's a little bit easier to rattle mentally than maybe some of the top guys, like roger federer?
sounds like we shouldn't ask you if you think roger is vulnerable since he's actually lost two matches in a row?
what exactly was the surgery they had to do in november?
what did they do exactly?
did they put the tendon back together after?
you practiced with roger on wednesday.
was that any help to you when you're trying to come back and play against a guy that good?
where was the procedure done on your shoulder?
where did you have the operation?
since you've gone through this a couple of times, do you sort of think, i've done this.  i've come back from the previous two.  do you start to worry, saying, this is the third one.  what am i going to have to do here?
do you have any goals for this year?  i mean, granted, it's taken you a while to get back.
since november when you actually sort of felt that were going to be able to play at a good level again, when did it click?
how much of a problem was the wind out there today for you?
you set a really wonderful pace for two or three years and you helped bring a lot of players up, and now it looks like they're going to force you to go up another level here.  is that accurate or inaccurate?
but they owe you a lot.
they owe you a lot.
what are the most difficult weather conditions to play in?  is it wind?  is it heat?  which is the most difficult?
your thoughts about your next match?  could be feliciano or donald young.
when i came in, it was about 5-5.
first set to young and second set is 6-5 young, on serve.  so 6-5, donald young is serving for the match.
if you were to play feliciano, do you approach the day any differently?  would you still practice with him, or would you just keep away from each other until after the match?
who is the better golfer out of the two of you?
which courses do you like playing out here?
you've played all the courses out here?
how many courses have you played out here?
four?
not this year?
your greatest strength as a golfer?  playing golf, the best part of your game?
which is a tougher game: golf or tennis?
do you play right-handed?
the theory is that left-handers grow up playing right-handers and they have a mental program for right-handers.  they have their toughest time against left-handers.  that's what laver once said.  is that true for you?
you're left-handed.
and when you grow up playing tennis --
-- you play mainly against right-handers.
but now you have to change the mental approach because you're playing a left-hander, maybe.  if you're playing a left-hander, do you have to think differently?  i'm only quoting rod laver, who said for him the hardest player for him to play was left-handed.  (laughter.)
became a little difficult at the end, but otherwise it was okay for you, was it?
what's he got about his game?  he's beaten nadal this year.  what makes him dangerous?
i saw your bit on leno on thursday night.
it was good.  very entertaining, as usual.  very charismatic.  you came on and admitted being nervous, and i was wondering why, considering the big moments performed on the tennis court, you're known for being a good communicator.  what made you nervous?
how did that all happen that you got on the tonight show?
no, i was just wondering.
do you have an equivalent talk show in serbia?  anything like that on serbian television?
you talked after the match about what this tournament kind of means to you and what it meant to your career last year.  can you kind of expand upon that more, just what this place meant to you?
can you talk about that extra thing?  is it more than just confidence?  is it belief?
when did you realize you kind of got that extra, you know, thing?  when it kind of switched in your head?  was it immediately after this tournament?  did it take a few weeks?
malisse or kohlschreiber in the next round.  they're pretty explosive shot makers.  do you like playing against that kind of guy?
did you see kohlschreiber and roddick?  did you watch that at the australian open?
you mentioned kind of steps in your career.  i imagine that a next step would be a no.1 ranking.  is that something that motivates you, and is that something you think is attainable this year with a good season?
you've had tremendous success on hardcourts.  when you step on a hardcourt, do you walk in feeling like you may be the best hardcourt player in the game right now?
how would you qualify your relationship with roger federer at this point?
are you working on any other impersonations?
so nadal, you do a lot of great impersonations of nadal, andy, roger, maria.  which is your favorite one?
have you played here as a collegiate?
so what's your thoughts?
any nerves working out there for the first time in the stadium?
can you talk about the match a little bit?  seemed to get away from you for a little bit there.  might have been a little scarey.
after washington and then the us open you sort of disappeared from the tour.  i think a lot of people thought you were going to play more.  obviously that was strategy on your part.  what were you doing at the end of last year?
did you get a chance to follow the football team, georgia?
did you go to the bowl?
not much suspense in that game.
got pretty angry when they didn't get into the championship game?
maybe this year.  it's pretty loaded, right?
who do you play in the next match?
what do you know about him, and what do you think is going to be the key for him?
any concerns about the wind if it's windy like this against davydenko?  do you think that's a problem for you, or do you think it could help you?
talk about marin, what impressed you most about him tonight.
can you talk about the service game. he broke you five times.
you must have been frustrated to get back into it in the second set, get broken back.
is it tougher because the second straight year here, two straight at the same tournament?
do you think the first break in the initial set relaxed him a little bit, being his first finals?
what do you take from this week moving forward to new york?
what happened in that first set?
you've played so well going up to today. why was it different today? why was it so strange?
nine double-faults. talk about what was going on with the double-faults.
how difficult is it to serve a double on match point?
your thoughts of mardy, do you think he could be a dangerous floater in the draw at the open?
apart from today, you must be fairly pleased with the way you've been playing generally going into the us open.
is it just mardy's serve that makes him dangerous or are there other things you see that make him a dangerous player next week?
fernando described it as a very strange match. is that fair?
can you talk about the importance of that break in the third set?
knowing how well you played here last year and the conditions and so forth, did you look at the draw before this tournament and kind of picture yourself, thinking, i could go really far this week?
some players talk about how it's often quite difficult, when they've won a 6-love set, to keep the momentum going. what's difficult about it?
when you've won a 6-love set and then even if you lose a couple of games at the start, even if it's still on serve, does it start playing with your mind a bit?
is there a reason you play well here?
last year you came here, james was creating lot of buzz, nikolay was a top 10 player. you flew under the radar. is it a different feeling this year without as many names, you're the american?
the summer's kind of been up and down a little bit. you had a great semifinal run in los angeles, but then canada, cincinnati, l.a., washington first round. what's been working well here this week?
have you had a chance to watch the other two semifinalists play at all this week? i know you've never played them. do you know anything about them at all?
this result here, talk about the impact it will have after the us open of getting you into some of the bigger events?
i believe there were 19 players in this field who were in beijing last week at the olympics. quite a few, like james blake, couldn't make it here. is there a certain value to you having made it to the finals here, knowing the past accomplishments of a lot of these guys?
you've really created quite a little fan base for yourself here in new haven. do you feel that?
that being the case, how pleased are you to have won this match today and make it to another final here?
does it bother you being that third american all the time or have you gotten pretty comfortable with the fact that you're always going to be james or andy, they'll always be talking about the young, up-and-coming players?
we understand that james is too big time to come watch you tomorrow. do you think some of the j block boys will be here to root you on?
first atp final. what do you think?
talk about your emotions when you were going to the net, knowing you were going to your first final?
did you get a little bit nervous when you served for the match at the end?
are you about where you thought you would be in terms of your career, making a final at this point? are you ahead of schedule? behind schedule?
you're going to break top 25. how important is it to you?
what did you start the season ranked?
what are your thoughts playing mardy, the american with some support here?
seems to be all the 19-year-olds at the moment are doing well, you, del potro, gulbis. are you all urging each other on?
have you talked to them about it, how they're doing?
what would you describe as your favorite surface?
talk about the way mardy was serving, how much pressure he was putting on you.
you played well here. what does it do for your confidence?
what was the difference today?
you came out of nowhere.
we don't have a lot of information on you. can you tell us basically your career.
are you a little surprised?
what do you find to be the best part of your game?
the second point of the 11th game, you hit it out. it was a late call. do you know what happened there?
helps to get a little luck out there, too.
through all the trials and tribulations you've had as a tennis player, have you ever thought maybe you would do something else? what has been your motivation?
is your coach here?
what's his name?
do your parents live in boca?
what is the last time you played on stadium court?
got to be a different atmosphere.
you played nadal today. you played federer in halle. how would you assess the difference between playing the two men?
it seemed the majority of the points that you were winning were on your first serve. perhaps if you had been able to maintain a higher first serve percent that would have kept you in had the match. were you trying to keep a high percentage, or you were you just trying to hit out outright winners on your first serve?
rafa is on the verge of taking over roger for the no.1 spot. why do you think he's just so unbeatable right now?
what aspect of his game did you find most difficult to overcome?
you've played rafael three times already this season. is there anything prior to going into this match that you adjusted in your personal game, something you thought maybe, i won't do that again that you learned from your previous games, or did you have a specific game plan for this particular player?
when you play a player more than once, do you adjust your game card according to the player, or no?
some players, when they've been on the tour for a while, find it difficult to cope with all the travel and all that's necessary to play at such a high level. what is your motivation and desire to do all this? where do you get it from, and how do you keep it?
you had five double faults this game. how would you rank this game compared to your others throughout the tournament?
you've had a chance to play nadal on hard courts and clay this year. obviously clay is considered to be his best surface. talk a little bit about the difference?
sorry, yes. can you talk about the differences, and how tough is he playing right now on this surface?
the schedule this year is like never before with so many big tournaments packed close together. do you think that will provide opportunities for other players and maybe titles could be shared around?
congratulations on your effort.
one thing i wanted to find out, is int eh women's game, as you know, clijsters and henin quit in their mid-20s. is there something in the men's game? we have more athletes that are 30 and above. why is that not the case with the women's tennis?
are you ready to play simon one more time?
was three hours just too much of a match after all that you've played in the past few weeks?
have you thought about how important it is for how well you've played the past few weeks, winning all nine matches, how big that is in your career?
have you seen the cincinnati draw?
what do you think about that?
what has improved most in your game?
how frustrating was it when you were up 5-4 in the third set and you had a chance to break him and you had that overhead smash that went into the net?
you said earlier in the week that you hadn't had time to contemplate all the good things you had done. you said that you could not play for a year, to enjoy it for the next year without playing. have you thought now about how much these last two weeks have meant to you, and will you celebrate?
have you been half expecting to do something great like this, or has it come as a little bit of a surprise?
what is your predominant emotion now? is it relief or pleasure in what you've done or disappointment or a mixture, or difficult to tell?
when you consider what you've done in the past two weeks and the way some of the top seeds have fallen in this tournament, does that inspire you moving forward, that no matter who you're facing you have the confidence to prevail?
you didn't have a chance to play djokovic or federer this week, but you looked very good against gasquet and murray with two really good hard court players. talk about your comments going into tomorrow and the rest of the hard court season.
how will you compare your victory tonight with the other opponents?
yes.
you're on a 30-match winning streak over clay, grass, and now hard court. how do you feel your hard court game is compared to last year or the year before where you struggled just a little bit on hard court?
you said that you could not compare each match because every match is different. do you not feel that your standard went up much higher tonight?
i imagine it's difficult to get back into it after wimbledon. do you feel you've done that now that you're back into the swing and playing as you would like to play?
sometimes you get code violations for taking too much time, but usually you don't react. today it seemed to bother you.
how confident are you that you can win the us open this year and make it three slams in a row?
you mentioned in a tv interview after, when you were smiling, that you enjoy playing here in canada and the reaction that you get from the crowd. talk a little bit about that.
you still talk a lot about wanting to improve your game. what are some of the specific things you're still trying to get better at?
you played kiefer three times this year. talk a little bit about the type of player he is.
the crowd obviously liked the way you played, and rafa said he thought you played one of your very best matches against him tonight. were you pleased, and did you think the same?
people often criticize you, rightly or wrongly, as being defensive or even negative. most of the time tonight you were taking it to him, attacking, which shows that you can play in different ways according to the opponent?
how do you compare his level to wimbledon and other times that you've played him on hard courts?
one of the things he said that he's focusing on is playing aggressive and putting more pressure so the matches go quicker and he's not having to run as much. do you sort of agree with that?
can you tell us how upset you were with the chair official when he overruled the line judge there, the eighth game in the second set.
how is the knee?
this is a very strong tournament for you with the win over djokovic and very strong match tonight. talk about how that affects your expectations going forward.
can you talk about what it's like to play doubles with jamie, and what you're looking forward to at the olympics this year.
been pretty long since a final, and long time since a title. how are you feeling?
you feel that maybe after all eight years of not winning a title that it means even more to be able to do what you've done this week?
can you talk a little bit about how long this match was? did you get tired out there, and how do you feel right now physically?
your career can almost be divided into two halves: before the injury and the one we're in now. in this half of your career, what are the goals both short- and long-term for you?
how do you feel about nadal and murray?
you said at the beginning of the week you wouldn't really have expected to make the final. when did you get the sense that you were playing really well and that you could make a deep run here?
two questions: has your doubles partner been decided for the olympics, kohlschreiber or schuettler?
tomorrow, if you play nadal, you've just recently played him at wimbledon. the surfaces is maybe to your advantage.
think positive.
what have you learned from that match that you would do differently tomorrow if you play him?
have you seen the cincinnati draw yet? if you have, what was your reaction when you saw the first round?
is the match going to be different? i know you're not looking at that yet, but talk about that. it's a strange event. you play in the semis and then first round next week.
who's your conditioning coach, and are you paying him enough?
you've had to do a lot of running in the last two weeks.
he started out hitting some very big shots and was giving you some trouble. seemed like at a certain point you started just keeping the ball in and letting him make mistakes. was that part of what you were looking at?
is that part of what happens when you're a younger player in terms of impatience and in terms of not quite having your shots down?
i know you have you've been playing a lot of tennis over the past two weeks, but have you been able to sit and reflect about what's it's been like to be on the greatest run of your career?
james blake has just lost. you'll be playing nicolas kiefer. what do you know about him?
what does it say about the men's tour right now that in this tournament, which is a very tough field, that it's two unseeded players on one side of the semifinal?
has the wind been much of a factor in the play the last two or three days or so?
has it affected the forehand or the backhand side more or the serves?
i meant the wind.
just the same?
how tired are you right now, or how tired were you when you started the match? what kind of a night did you have last night?
when do you feel the fatigue? you seem to get on the court and you find another gear. when do you feel the fatigue: before and after or just after?
when is the last time you felt this tired, or have you ever felt this tired?
what do you do to rest? watch tv, a movie, read a book, just go straight to sleep and wake up when you have to?
what did you think of that first set? that was a very tough, long tiebreak.
what did you think of the way he played, especially the first set?
did you feel like he started to wear down as the match went on, started to get tired and slow a little bit as the match went on?
he said that he thinks you're the best player in the world without a doubt right now. you haven't said that, but do you believe that?
you're undefeated against and murray, your opponent tomorrow. is that a factor when getting prepared for a match? do you think about stuff like that?
the decision to bring toni with you as opposed to francisco roig, who usually accompanies you to the hard court tournaments after wimbledon. is that because this year you won wimbledon and you're getting closer to becoming no.1 and toni needs to examine a little bit more what it takes to becoming no.1?
being so close, now that you've defended your points from last year's tournament and with roger losing so many. after almost 160 weeks at no.2, how does it feel to be so close that many weeks at no.2 to taking over the ranking, which is now pretty much a mathematical certainty in the next month?
how rewarding is it for you to have a result like this at a masters series event after the injuries that you've had over the past few years?
after a couple of late night matches this week and a long match yesterday with davydenko, how are you feeling physically at this point?
when you were at your best you were a top 4 player in the world. how close are you to getting back to that level, do you feel?
two questions: first one, do you think that this match was quickly? do you feel that was easy match? and another one, how do you feel here in toronto?
how do you feel in toronto?
four years ago you made the semifinals here. you had just been in the finals at two tournaments, and shortly after that you hurt your wrist again. you just had more bad luck that most players on the tour have seen or deserve.
do you ever look back and kind of just lament what could have been?
no?
has there been any lingering results from the injuries? anything that you can't do that you could before, or are you as physically strong and fit as you've ever been?
really?
if you could go back 15 years and start over again, do you know if there's anything you could have done to avoid some of the injuries? anything in terms of training, stretching?
such as what?
basically what would you have done different?
you never played simon before. what do you know about him?
how do you explain that on one side of the draw four seeds made the quarters and did what they were expected to do, but on this side of the draw it seemed like a much more dangerous minefield for the seeded players?
does that put into perspective a little bit what roger and also rafa have done over the last several years where they've been so consistent at winning and getting to finals and advancing through draws that they've almost made it look easy?
what did you think when you had rafa in the first set there?
did fatigue play a role in the second set at all? were you a little tired?
what's it like trying to put him away? it took six set points in that tiebreak, which was a really a remarkable tiebreak, and he just kept coming and coming.
is there anybody else in the sport who matches his mental strength?
overall, this week gives you confidence moving forward for the rest of the hard court season. how do you feel your game is at the moment?
at 1-1 in the second set you had a couple of breakpoint chances there. how disappointing was that right there?
are you happy about your performance tonight?
the first two sets looked like federer last night a bit: easy first set and a tough second one. were you concerned in the second set about maybe dropping this game?
concerned in the second set.
uh-huh.
did you watch the federer match yesterday? and either way, what was your general impression?
since your winning match by match, don't think -- and federer has lost already -- don't you think that he's now chasing you instead of you chasing him like this was before?
don't you think that since yannick noah left and since djokovic earlier said that he finished with mimicking everyone on the court, that some entertaining is just get out of the tennis, of the game? it's just became just fine job, no more entertaining?
i know we're asking a lot about the federer match, but the result had a big impact. do you see it as significant that he lost so early, or do you think it's something that shouldn't be paid that much attention to?
that's why we're asking you, because you know how tough it is.
are you surprised that andreev played as well as he did after he turned his ankle in the first set?
could you tell that he was in pain or anything?
how is your golf game and what is your handicap right now?
what are your plans before the us open?
can you talk about your next match a little bit? gasquet won the first set.
were you pleased to close that out so efficiently?
was he the kind of opponent that could get quite difficult and dangerous?
you said that you came here much fresher than you had been at wimbledon. is it nevertheless important to conserve energy and not get into long matches?
without looking too far forward, roger going out of a tournament is fairly notable at this stage. do other players take note of that? what do you think of it?
that said though, is there a lesson for the top players that everybody is vulnerable at some point to a lesser player?
you mentioned that you already noted that roger federer lot his match. does it influence your play?
does it put more pressure on you?
coming into this tournament, we're all looking at roger and rafa because of the waves that the wimbledon match created. for the first half of the year i think you were the best player on tour. do you feel forgotten or overshadowed at all, given you're right around the level of those two guys, but right after wimbledon they're the subject of conversation and not you?
you're known a little bit for your impersonations of people's serves. have you been working on any new ones that you want to show the fans in toronto?
what's the happiest moment in your life?
does it feel any different at all coming into a tournament as champion? a little bit of a boost, or just the same?
yeah.
will it affect you when you get on the court?
you are the defending champion, but last year's tournament was at a different site in montreal. does it feel different, or do you still feel like you own the tournament coming in being that it's in a different place?
how do you think you played today?
what do you think of the toronto weather so far?
does that sort of hinder how you reset when you have the breaks and you have to go in and come back, especially when it's the first match of the week?
when you're up a break and you initiated the rain delay, weren't you afraid you may lose your momentum?
this has been a bit of an uneven year for you. you've had some really high points and then you had the shoulder. where are you at right now on how you feel physically and otherwise?
is it more frustrating because you have had some high points this year: you beat roger, you beat novak, you beat rafa, and you also gotten engaged. i mean, it was pretty good year for a while.
the first game of the second set when mahut held serve you were pretty upset about that. did that rally you at all? what did you say to the umpire?
were you happy or disappointed that it wasn't tipsarevic out there again today?
you were pretty philosophical after the loss at wimbledon.
how difficult was it to get over compared to, say, the australian open loss or other tough losses you've had?
when you're coming in off a loss like that, talk a little bit about sort of the desire to win and kind of prove yourself and get back on track versus sort of feeling extra pressure not to lose because you maybe haven't had the big wins?
seems like you're playing pretty confidently. can you assess your chances for the rest of the tournament and also throughout the hard court season?
you have been a top 5 guy, now top 6, but basically a top 5 guy for an extended period of time. you've had the bad luck to be around while roger made his run at pete sampras and now with rafa making his run at roger. if you get back to where you want to be and improve the way you want to improve, where do you think you fit in the bigger scheme?
great doubles draw at this event. does that create a little bit of extra interest, motivation, when you see all the great singles players in the doubles draw?
just to start with, i guess the positive angle, what was it like to have that kind of cheering section behind you?
you've played, especially this year, all over the place. how far was your commute from thornhill today?
how long have you known jesse, and do you keep in touch on a regular basis outside of your competitive encounters?
how much pressure do you have or how difficult was it for you to be one of the sole people carrying the canadian flag into this event?
do you think that this was a good opportunity because levine has played in qualification a great match yesterday? you were supposed to play against baghdatis who i think is 32nd. you both could face rafael nadal in the second round, so it was a great opportunity for you.
in the first set, why it was so hard to win your serve?
what happened today?
do you still feel that you're recovering from the injury that forced you to miss wimbledon this year?
what exactly is it in the leg?
strained?
if you're not feeling 100%, why do you continue to play? seems like you achieved so much already.
can we just joke around a bit?
so is nadal dead meat tomorrow?
what would be the plan in making him dead meat?
must be kind of fun in away to play against somebody that good.
what made the difference today?
wasn't too tough coming back after such a difficult match yesterday?
talk a little bit about your level of play when you were 12, 13, or whenever you left, and what the united states experience, particularly in boca raton, what that did for your game?
i gather from friends of mine in ottawa that you return regularly so you've maintained contact with your school friends?
your game plan for tomorrow against rafa?
do you retain both citizenships?
anything could happen tonight, but if djokovic wins then you'll be the only canadian-born player left in the tournament. any satisfaction about that?
have you had a match against a guy sort of this good or close to this good that you'll be able to use as a helpful point in getting ready?
is there any advantage to being a left hander playing a left hander?
were you surprised at how efficient you could get, i guess, rid of him?
is your shoulder fully 100% healthy?
which shoulder is that?
very impressive service game today. you actually only surrendered six points on serve all match. is that something that you've been working on lately?
but it's not specifically something you've worked on?
what's the recipe for keeping the shoulder as good as possible?
what happened at indian wells this year when you're playing so well and you feel something and you're forced to stop?
talk about davydenko next. you've had really close matches with him.
what makes you continue to play not only this tournament but on the tour if you're not 100%?
the crowd was really supporting you, but at such a close time when you were really close, did that ever have a negative effect and turn into pressure that you didn't want?
is there any sense of disappointment that you have that you're the only canadian in the top 100, or is it not a really big concern of yours?
because you're the only canadian ranked so high in this tournament, do you feel added pressure when you come here to toronto to play?
your doubles partner thinks that all of canada should cheer for him now because he's canadian born. what do you think about him?
who is the tougher player to play against: djokovic or nadal?
you were at the net quite a bit. do you enjoy playing at the net, or do you only approach it when obviously the ball is dropped short and you have to?
that first game you had a couple of chances to break him. if that goes different, do you think this is a different result?
when the crowd started chanting, go frank, it started to sound like a hockey game, didn't it?
some of the top players put pressure on you in different ways. how did you feel pressure from novak? what was part of his game that was toughest for you?
the crowd obviously loved you tonight and you were feeding off of it. when the wave is going on and the chants are going on, does etiquette play into your mind, or is that all positive for you?
you mentioned doubles. you move on to doubles now tomorrow. are you able to still put as much focus on doubles? do you try to set this aside now?
how far are you from the level of playing of a guy like djokovic?
seemed like the frustration became another opponent down the stretch. was that something that sort of got under your skin?
to play so well in the first set, what happened between the first and second set?
did you feel psychologically that you were down going into the second set because of what happened in the tiebreaker?
what do you do between now and beijing?
does this give you more rest time now to sort of focus?
were you surprised you didn't get a warning when the ball sort of launched out of the stadium down the stretch?
how tough is it for a canadian to play in this event?
there's a lot of pressure in montreal, isn't there?
whereas here you can get that focus?
has nikolay improved since you last played him? does he do anything differently now?
has nikolay improved since you last played him? does he do anything differently?
were you surprised at just how aggressive nikolay was today? he seemed to be standing very close to the baseline, taking a lot of balls on the rise, taking a lot of time away from you. were you surprised by his aggression today?
were you 100% fit physically? are you feeling well?
especially your forehand today?
yeah.
do you think that nikolay is sort of the guy that at least here we don't hear that much about? you know, everyone writes about you and roger and andy. do you think he's kind of the forgotten guy in the top 5? people don't give him enough credit?
what are the things that make him different, and what makes him particularly difficult to play?
i know it's very soon after the match for you, but would you be able to turn your mind to thinking about the clay court season, which is about to begin, and a few thoughts about the part of the season you like best?
you said that he didn't change his style, but is there something about his style that didn't allow you to get into your rhythm, or was it just one of those days for you?
the fact that they've switched to a two-out-of-three format, seems like it would be a particular disadvantage to a player like yourself. i wonder how you and others feel about the switch from three-out-of-five to two-out-of-three in the scoring.
with the results of tournaments at that start of this year, do you see the men's side being wide open right now as far as who's going to become the dominant player?
how nice does that feel, sitting next to that trophy?
do you believe that you're not really well-known in america, but now after winning big tournament like this in america maybe...
do people recognize you on the grounds when you walk around?
everybody knows you've been going through a difficult time. how have you been able to play your very best tennis at this extremely difficult time in your life?
was winning here the best performance of your career?
was winning the title also, this title, the best thing you won in your career?
you had said out on the court you had never played that well in miami before. what do you think what was the difference this time? what were you feeling? was it really so much the racquet?
rafa said he did not play well today. gave you credit but he said he really had a bad day. how did you see it? did you feel like you caused that bad day by rushing him a lot, by being more aggressive?
tactically you played a perfect match, as you just said, and i remember after you won your semifinal match you said that you would consult with djokovic to find out how he beat him in indian wells. did you actually make that call or was it just a joke?
in the ninth game of the first set you went up to the umpire and had a discussion. were you complaining about him playing slowly?
the situation with the investigation, you've been in limbo for so long now. is this something you think about only when we bring it up? is it on your mind every day? how would you describe it?
you're not concerned about what the outcome is going to be?
i have to ask about the racquet. will the racquet be retired now, or will you continue to play with this particular racquet?
why do you bring such a big bag on then if you only need one racquet? you could just carry the one on.
how do you see the men's side now? do you think it's wide open as far as who can be the dominant player this year? roger federer, for years, has dominated the men's. do you think it's wide open where anybody can take over?
do you think the masters series should be a best-of-five-set final?
but as a general principle?
do you feel like you outlasted, as you call him, the animal today?
so do you think that if this had been best three-of-out-of-five you think you would have beaten him anyway?
can you speak a little about the fact you played so much against nadal's forehand, normally his better shot.
we've always known you to be a very hard worker.
but you haven't always expressed passion for the game. i think people haven't seen that in you. do you think you showed more of that in this tournament, maybe, than in the past?
would you say it was a quick, the turn around was too quick or this guy just played out of his tree tonight?
did you have any hangover from last night, or was that not a factor?
transition beginning to feel more natural to you?
it's not instinctive, is it?
no, i'm asking you.
you made that great return on the dropshot. you held, and then broke him with dynamite game, and then, boom, gave it back. was that like the turning point, you feel, in that match?
a powerful player as yourself, does it ever surprise you how much power he generates out of that rather spindly body?
i don't ever remember see seeing him laugh at the net. what did you say to him?
difficult round for you going quickly over to davis cup and everything indoors?
can you just talk about those potential singles matchups, andy, with tsonga and gasquet?
the crowd there, i don't know, last year all you guys came back and said it was incredible, you wanted to go back there. how much do you think that they can help out just in being behind you guys and cheering?
you leave here with mixed emotion? at one point you knocked roger off. one thing you took care of, but didn't quite finish the job?
pretty incredible second set. you won the last 12 points and no unforced errors. were you feeling pretty on top of him?
did you feel like after you double-faulted to lose the set on the 7th set point that he kind of went away, that you defeated him mentally at that point?
how much better are you as a hard-court player now than three years ago when you were in the final here?
we had a sensational match last night here. did you watch it? federer versus roddick. if you did, what are your thoughts?
are you surprised that it's andy and not roger?
i think i read something on your blog that people shouldn't be too hard on roger. based on last night's match, don't say that something is wrong with roger, that he played well. can you talk a little bit about that?
you had a tough tournament in indian wells and took a pretty tough loss there. i was just wondering how long did it take you to overcome that emotionally or being down about that? in general, how did you deal with a loss? because you've come back and are playing really, really well.
in the first game of the match, you hit two very powerful backhands, but for the rest of the match we didn't really see that anymore. can you explain, because you can hit that shot, why you don't do it more often?
because a lot of times you played the backhand more safe, but you can hit it very powerful, and people talk about how you should play aggressive on hard courts. it's much talked about. that's why, because you can hit the shot, and we'd like to see it more often maybe.
i know you still have a match to go here, but could you look ahead to next week in the davis cup against germany and your thoughts on that?
talk about your match and andy in dubai, and what do you have to do if you play him in the finals to beat him? obviously return of serve is the key.
but against andy, is the key returning his serve? that it?
every player wants to wins tournaments, grand slams. where does achieving the no.1 ranking fit for you? how much of focus is there on that? what would it mean to you if that were to come?
a lot of the european players tell us that this part of the calendar is very hard for them. they get tired being in the united states for a month or over five weeks. you seem to play well in these tournaments. are you comfortable here in the united states for that long of time? and if so, why is that?
andy murray has just announced that had alex corretja is going to be his coach through the clay season. your thoughts on that whether you're surprised, because alex is a tv guy now, and what you think he can help andy with.
perhaps the one phase of your game that has improved the most is your serve, both first and second serve. could you assess for us how much improvement you've made over the last two years in your serving?
very fast match. can you talk about that?
assuming that roger federer wins his match tonight, after these losses that keep mounting up to roger, do you ever go home and think, i'll try something new next time? i think i have the way to play him now?
do you do something different with roger, then, next time?
in some of the matches against roger you were like the better player, and every time you got close it kind of slipped away from you. how do you look back -- do you agree with that?
you say you don't really believe that you sometimes can beat him.
sorry to insist with this subject, but now, considering that cnas beat him twice, nalbandian beat him twice, volandri beat him, fish beat him, so this doesn't create in you a difference sensation when you will go into the court to face him again?
you said, you know, roddick might win this. talk a little bit about roddick. i know you haven't beaten him either. talk about his game a little bit. what's tough?
the other thing is tipsarevic said very nice things about you today. he said that he thought you were one of the steadiest players on the tour and you've gone through a lot in the past, but you always seem to be able to concentrate on your matches. can you talk about that, how hard it's been at times, or has it been in the past? and how do you, you know, stay steady and concentrate when all sorts of things are going on around you?
what are your thoughts on the olympic games this year? both your thoughts personally about beijing and also about the status of tennis at the olympics.
your english is much better now.
if your name is ever cleared by the atp, will you sue the atp?
but if your name is cleared and the atp finally says, no, he was not involved in this. we're sorry all this happened --
-- will you sue the atp?
but ronnie says, when i talked to him, he is prepared that you should sue if that's the case. ronnie leitgeb says he thinks you should look into suing. he's your advisor, right?
regarding the olympics, we understand the situation with so much flying. but you're almost like better about it, aren't you, playing in one place one week and then another place the next? you're definitely committed to the olympics, are you, or are you thinking about...
i see you've never won a grand slam. how important to you is that as a goal?
because normally the top players, they say they really focused on the grand slams, and you're saying you're focusing on everything, not specifically the big tournaments.
how would you compare this match to the one in indian wells?
even though he hit those break points he didn't convert it. ground you down a bit. seemed like you were walking on the edge a bit.
when did it change? because after the first set, i mean, it looked like you were really in control. what happened there?
did you ever at any point consider smashing yourself three times in the head with a tennis racquet?
youzhny got over half a million hits on youtube.
we know, because you've said it to us many times, one of the things you fought against as you've gotten older is the tendency to get down and stay down. was that something where you just weren't executing on the court?
is there a physical solution to dealing with him? staying with him? staying in the match all the way through? is it the kind of thing maybe with some different training technique or whatever, you could...
correct me if i'm wrong, in both these matches your level seemed to decline, even physically your body language and stuff as you got deep into the match and toward the end. you know, that's what it looked like from the stands.
patrick mcenroe was just named today director of elite player development by the usta. you see him working with young players, practice partners on the davis cup team. what makes him good for the job, and are you concerned at all that he's getting spread too thin? he has a lot of roles.
how about andy's match tomorrow with roger? how do you see that? you've gotten to see andy here.
speaking about patrick mcenroe, how would you describe him as a man and as a captain?
seemed like there was a world of difference between the way you were hitting the ball at the beginning and the end. fair to say?
when you're up 3-love and you've won six games in a row are you kind of bumming or...
were you seeing the lightening those last few games and thinking, we better get this done?
there really was lightening.
how about playing roger next?
i think i think so. have you heard of him?
is there anything you can isolate about the matches that have been tighter matches with him that you've done better technically? i assume you've thought about that.
you're a very goal-oriented person and athlete. has it been harder for you as the record got lopsided against him not to build him into a monster of frustration in your mind?
obviously pretty good serving day, would you say?
once you pulled out the tiebreak, seemed like he just went away. does that happen often? seems like it does. do you sense that from the opponents sometimes?
out of all the sort of outdoor hard court places you play, how do the conditions here suit you? there's wind and the humidity. how does this rate as a place to play for you?
if you win this tournament, will you sort of silence those people who began to doubt you a bit after your recent setbacks and problems, or do you think you've done that already?
if there's one thing that's important playing in the wind, what is it? is it patience? what aspect is important playing in the wind?
there's going to be a three-set final this year. how do you feel about that? there are mixed reviews.
you've been in the u.s. now for three weeks. when you come here, is there anything culturally, whether it's like silly reality tv or final four, something more weighty that you get into when you come to the united states?
you don't have to, you know, pick a candidate, but from your perspective, what do you make of the political race from where you sit?
since you bring up politics...
if i may, let me ask you about the olympics and tibet. there are a handful of athletes from various places if various sports from around the world who said they will protest in various ways because of the situation in tibet.
boycotting the opening ceremonies, wearing ribbons perhaps, that kind of thing. is that something that you would think about doing, along those lines?
do you have any concerns about the air quality in beijing? american runners are saying...
you may have andy roddick again in the next round. are you ever wondering the law of averages will catch up to you with him?
when you had mono, did you ever think of mario ancic and the fact he missed like six months?
did it surprise you it was so short?
just go back to the olympics real quick. for most sports i think the olympics are probably the pinnacle of the sport. in tennis, where do you think winning a gold medal would rank? i mean, is that slam-level achievement or masters series? where do you think that ranks as far as tennis is concerned?
obviously radek is never easy, just a tough out, isn't he?
you were hitting your backhand really pure and nice today. almost better than your forehand.
do you think in florida with the wind and humidity you're better acclimated?
you don't have a great track record in this tournament, james. do you feel like things are different for you this year?
obviously the davis cup title, big thrill for you. how hungry are you to get that first masters title?
how confident are you, if it's rafa? obviously i don't know how confident you are, but talk about what you need to do to beat rafa, if it, indeed, is him?
is that one of his main attributes, he just hates to lose more than anyone you've played.
on the subject of the olympics and tibet, a handful of athletes from various places, india, norway, in various sports have talked about perhaps protesting at the games, wearing ribbons, boycotting opening ceremonies. is that something you would consider doing?
for the individual athletes who do take a position, do you feel that's their rightful place, or is that not the proper forum for that kind of thing?
were you surprised by andy's decision not to go to the olympics this year?
you had to stop a couple times because of the rain. was it difficult to keep a rhythm?
you play mathieu next?
can you speak a bit about playing him? he's made a lot of progress in the last year.
i have one historical question for you. i know carlos was your mentor, but gustavo kuerten, was he someone you admired when you were younger? and what do you think he meant to tennis, and especially clay tennis?
what is it about fabrice? he gives people fits a lot. what is it about the way he plays?
you feel relief? did you worry at any point?
is that hat a final four statement?
speaking of another sport, we understand you hit deep at marlins stadium yesterday.
how windy was it?
did you play baseball as a kid?
how much are you looking forward to the olympics?
as far as the competition, how would it compare to a grand slam, do you think?
the hard court season is so important to you usually, especially new haven and the us open. i mean, beijing could really kind of throw a wrinkle into that for you. but you're willing to make that tradeoff?
the u.s. men got shut out in athens in tennis. would it be important for you guys to change that? is there a collective motivation there?
in athens?
well, let me rephrase it. what about the team aspect of it?
what do you think about patrick announcing that he's not going to the olympics, or andy?
so baseball season's almost starting. how do you follow mets games?
first two sets were pretty tight, and then you kind of raced away in the third. what made you have a better showing in the third?
what was the trouble he was giving you in the first two sets? what do you think he did best?
how is life different for you since australia? do you notice more people are interested in you? more commitments?
can you just give us your impressions of the match.
was the wind much of a factor down on the court?
is that kind of what happened when you were serving for the match there in that second?
why do you think your serve wasn't quite what you wanted?
you still did a heck of a lot of very good things and played a pretty assertive match, didn't you, compared to some recently?
didn't see the marseille final, but did you play better tonight than that?
when you're playing a game, talking with your team, whatever, what's the philosophy on drop shots? you still feel that the percentage is high enough to keep going for it?
obviously you have a lot of points to defend here. is there any - relief is not the right word - but, you know, would it be easier now to look forward? you've got a lovely sort of clear run where the only way is up from now on.
very soon after the match, but this is the only chance we get to ask you. do you know what you're doing now?
it was pretty clear pro argentine environment. is it tough playing in that sort of environment?
what do you think went wrong today?
are the crowds different in miami? certainly you have a lot of argentines. you have a lot of nationalities represented. is it different down here?
lleyton, what is the injury?
do you know exactly what it is?
and is it a case of just having to rest it or what?
bearing that in mind, were you still a bit satisfied with the way you were actually managing to move and hit the ball today?
yeah, i was going to ask you, with those set points if you had won that second set and with the injury, any idea on how you would have stood up to that third set?
what do you think you'll do now?
in the first set you were down a couple of games during the beginning, which is, of course, that's not uncommon.  but do you ever start to panic, or does it kind of affect your game if you're down a couple of games?  how do you handle that?
you seemed to be turning that match around quite nicely.  2-love in the final set, and then there was that time violation warning.  what did you make of that instance, and how much did it affect the course of the whole match?
you could say different things.  are you able to say?
what physical condition did you come into this tournament having had such a long tournament in indian wells?
were you surprised at how well kevin anderson was able to defend from the back of the court?  because i think everybody was expected you to win, the majority of those baseline exchanges, but it didn't always work out that way.
in those circumstances when you do get a chance, you really have to take it.  i suppose you'll think just when you had the opportunities you didn't really impose yourself.
how difficult is it to win these masters series back-to-back?
in the long scheme of things, this is just a temporary setback, obviously.  now you're looking forward to the clay court season to reassert your winning ways.  what can which expect in the next few weeks and months?
can you talk about particularly in this tournament that you were talking yesterday after winning here last year, you had such good memories here, to go out so early, what your emotions are?
do you think there might be too much off-court activities in between the tournaments?
did you know anything about kevin before?
i don't know if you've ever heard of red grange, possibly the greatest football player in illinois history.  but i suppose this might earn you a picture up on the wall at the athletic department alongside red.
so i guess you made the right decision to turn pro then.
what's been the thing that you've noted the most as far as having to make the transition?  like you said, being on your own more, but beyond that.
when you got through the qualifying and you saw the draw and you see that you have novak djokovic in your initial match, how did you prepare for this?
when the umpire called that time violation on novak he won that point, but you won the next 13 in a row.  was novak's sort of ball bouncing and so forth, was that an irritant to you at all?
from the first matchpoint, was that a tight one for you?
you seemed a bit in disbelief when you won.
how many text messages and phone calls have you received already since the end of it?  and has tiley been one of those?
what were you studying, and how does a guy from south africa get to illinois?
how about the decision of going to college versus just joining the tour right away?  was that even an option?
at what age did you come to the u.s.?
did you feel, from the beginning of the match, novak was a little off?  that your game was throwing him off?  what were you sensing from him?
are you by yourself here?  or are you traveling with anybody?
where are you based here in the states?
mike said that tiley came to wimbledon this year.  was that a wimbledon junior tournament?
and what impact did that have on your decision to go to college?
did he give you any advice at that time?
do you think cliff drysdale will introduce himself to you now?
are you saying you don't think you want to travel with a coach at this point?
south africa used to be a presence in tennis, and that's fallen off.  when you were growing up, was there anyone you looked to, perhaps, ferreira, i don't know?
where was that?
where you were growing up?
is your father a tennis coach?
you're earning a nice paycheck here and vegas as well.  but i'm told i should ask you about the ferrari you received for your birthday.
are you 6'5" or 6'7"?
it's unusual to see someone that height as agile as you are, particularly your ability to hold the baseline.  your footwork seems to be surprisingly good.  where is that coming from?  were you a football player when you were younger also?
people say they learn more from the losses typically than their wins and it might be too soon afterwards.  but do you think you might look back and see that anything you learned from today's win?
you said at the beginning that you've watched him play on tv, but sometimes it's different when you play them in person.  how is it different?  what did you expect going in, and how is he different than what you see on tv when you're actually playing him?
this this is not meant in an unfriendly, but i want to ask, are you tired of tennis?
do you see a renaissance then in your game?
do you kind of understand what has gone wrong for you this year, or have you just not put your finger on it?
i was talking about technically.  presumably you're out here, you like playing, but you like to win?
you stopped two match points today.  it is the first time you were playing this man.  can you talk about your opponent a little and what he did.
does the fact that you've picked yourself up off the floor before in your career, does that help you now in terms of your outlook?
are you feeling healthy now, pretty good?
that outlook, is that indefinite?  do you think if you have a bad clay court season would you look at it again in the summer?
what do you still kind of find interesting like about the actual game or the travel or both?  what is it that really attracts you?
are you afraid you'd be bored?
no, i'm asking you if you're anxious about what the next step in your life will be?
is it a matter of confidence at all?  because you haven't been winning matches?  is that what's lacking, do you feel?
can you talk about you're sort up and down from last week to this match today.  what do you think happened there today?  you had some break chances.
obviously, most people in the world will never be able to say they beat roger federer.  but what does that feel like when you actually do it, and the next day or the night?
how much does that do for your confidence, obviously, knowing that you can do that, and you did it back-to-back-to-back there.  what does that do for you going forward?
what is the legacy of that?  do you have any physical sort of effects from that, that great run?
against federer, you attacked so relentlessly.  do you feel like you attacked enough today?
you missed a passing shot on set point; plenty of time to get that.  was that part of not concentrating?
i can't recall after cincinnati and the olympics whether you were injured or whether it is a similar situation where you just didn't bounce out of that like this?
well, the run didn't quite continue the way you wanted it to.
what's next?
do you think this is the hardest thing?  obviously you can play with any of these people, and you showed you beat them all last week and all that.  but doing it week to week and having that mental strength to be able to come down and up and do what you've got to do?
how much clay this year will you play?
andy talked about you today.  just what you guys talked about.  he said that he'd really love to see you build on these runs that you have.  do you ever talk to him about the mental part?
how many did you get?
it looked like there in the second set, i think it is the fourth game, you came back down from love-40, and you had that ball at your feet and won the point there for the game.  maybe in a might have been a turning point.  did you feel the momentum changing there?
pleased with your performance overall?
you started the match very well.  can you talk about what got turned around or how you felt?
you talk about how much of a whirlwind it's been since you won the del rey tournament?  kind of just how things have gone for you?  how much attention you've gotten from back home?
how do you feel about your prospects going forward now after this, and after kind of the contrast beating blake in the del rey final and after your match here today?  how do you feel about your prospects going forward?
can you just sort of go through the match?  you spoke yesterday, and you said you were all pumped and worked really hard, what do you think happened there?
what was it like, just the experience of being on stadium court and all that?
he said you looked a little bit tired and he took advantage.  was that the case at all?
where do you go from here?  what's up next?
can you talk about kei?  he's had a good run at del rey, and people are looking at him now.  you probably train with him?
were you there at that impromptu party when he came back from del rey that some guys had a keg for him or something?
how has the experience with miami felt so far with some friends coming down and all that?
you may have had a lot of israeli supporters.  last night we had a reception.  i know you couldn't make it.  but a lot of people wanted to watch you play, and your parents would have been a hit at the reception last night.
how is it different from playing college when you're out there on center court in a tournament like this, even a big gator match?
you had played him before you said at 14s or something.
he's changed as a player too, i'm sure.
how do you feel you held his serve?
can you talk a little bit about how great it is for serbia to have jelena finishing no.1, nenad winning today, you winning, too.
many great champions got the masters title, sampras, agassi, federer. what does this masters title mean to you?
when you were serving for the match at 5-4, did the mexican wave and all the noise from that break your concentration?
you've had a huge year, your first masters cup and your first grand slam. at the australian open you had to go through federer. here you didn't have to face him. can you compare them from that aspect. are you relieved? are you disappointed?
as we can see, there is a sharp contrast between your performance last year and that of this year. what helped you to make this big progress?
you're the representative of the new generation of tennis players who make it to the top. do you think the competition has got more close between the top players in the world this year?
there will be an event held in your country. can you talk about that. i know you do a lot of work for that.
you're going to finish this season 10 points behind federer in the rankings. what is your target for next season? do you think you can go to no.1 next year?
last night you were pretty tired after playing for three hours. you're back out here less than 20 hours later. can you talk a little bit about how you managed to recover.
here is a fun question since you're a man full of fun. three presents every night, so 10 days makes it 30 presents.
so how do you handle the presents usually? do you have enough packing space?
how do you feel being the winner, especially being the last man standing again after a long, long time?
do you have a driver's license?
what will you do with the car you win today?
it seems that the top four players are all very, very strong in defense as well, not only in offense. it's very hard to get a point against you. the players have to go five, six, even more shots. is that something that you particularly worked on or it just came? if so, when did it come?
i saw that the trainer came in after the match. did you hurt yourself a little bit while celebrating your victory?
20 minutes into the match and you were 0-5 down. is that because he played fantastic or you played poorly?
this was the very first final you ever played in any of the major tournaments. were you feeling a bit nervous, considering you played quite well yesterday?
can you talk about getting to the finals of the masters cup and not facing federer. is that a different sort of feeling for you to get to the final and not face federer?
you mentioned on many occasions that the key factors of your victory is to be positive. it seemed you were negative in the whole match today. have you ever tried to persuade yourself to be positive?
when there is federer and nadal you were no.3, and when novak djokovic make it no.3 you are no.4. now we have andy murray and you are no.5. so you're always the best player besides the big somebodies.
my question is, are you satisfied with this position, or do you make it your mind to be the big somebody yourself?
can you talk a little bit more about when you broke back in the second set for 5-5, what happened in the next game. seemed like djokovic was really getting angry and the momentum was on your side.
who do you think will be no.1 at the end of next year?
you said you wanted to change something to get better. this week you said your volleys are not very good. is maybe that something you can work on for next season?
what came to your mind first after the last point? this is your fourth time in shanghai. can you name one thing which impressed you most?
here in shanghai, masters cup.
in the city.
what came to your mind first after the last point?
in the 10th game of the second set when novak was 30-40 down, he bounced the ball 17 times before his serve and it was a fault.
then 11 more times and double-faulted. do you laugh to yourself in your heart, don't do that again?
a couple of years ago you played like 30 tournaments, many matches. this year you reduced a little bit.
how will you plan your future?
let's talk about your sponsors. we see you have two sponsors. your current sponsors are all from china.
li ning.
you did a good job in this masters cup . do you think that will help you to --
does that give you the potential to have more sponsors?
before novak called the injury time-out, did you realize he had some injury problem? how serious did you think it was?
was it difficult to prepare for this match, given that you, i guess, got back to the hotel and found out very late that you were into the semifinals?
how would you rate your performance today, especially in the first set with your play being particularly high?
you did much better than novak when he was in his first masters cup. what are your best memories here in shanghai? based on novak's performance today, do you think he has a better chance to win this masters cup?
your country always has so many talented players. before this year not so many people talked about you. now you're the french no.1.
maybe before the australian open. before this year did you think you could go this far? compared to other top french players, what is your biggest talent, do you think?
so how you're gonna celebrate this great, great tournament for you after you finish the masters cup, and how are you going to prepare for next year?
could you tell me what you think about the davis cup final next week in argentina.
it seems you were injured during the match. what happened at that time?
how did you sort of feel out there in general?
any regrets about going all out yesterday against roger?
you had seven winners and your opponent had 33. can you talk about this? maybe you played too defensively?
you made a signal to your team i think in the third game after you tried to run down a shot. was that a signal to them that you couldn't lift your game physically?
after you had seen us last night you went back to the hotel. what time did you get to sleep, stuff like that?
this is clearly your first experience at this championship. can you give us some idea of your overall impression of it and how hard it is for any player to be able to play the way they'd like to play at this end of the tennis season.
can you give us a little bit more specifics on how you were feeling on the court today. did your legs feel heavy? moving was hard?
with body language for you, do you look at your opponent's body language a lot? can you ever feed off that? if they're looking tired, do you feed off that? how would you evaluate your body language today?
maybe a little soon after this match, but if you could, take a little time and reflect on your year. you had what seems a good breakout year. talk about your reflections on that.
what is your opinion about the davis cup final, who is going to win, and why?
you mentioned beating roger federer was a huge success for you. beating roger three times in a season was impressive. you also hold the most wins against nadal and djokovic. how do you assess your 2008?
looking at roger and rafa for next year, where you do you see them? what are the strengths and weaknesses you think they bring to the table for 2009?
tomorrow's final, your prediction?
except you and other three players into this game are all their first time qualified for the semifinals. what are your comments on the young players?
talk about what you showed this week and how excited you are to be in the final.
djokovic just said he met you in the final because he will have more confidence because he has beaten you in the round robin. how do you comment on that?
andy was clearly tired after his match with federer yesterday. if you had been in his situation, 2-0 going into a match with federer, would you have considered saving some in reserve for the semifinal? would you ever have considered that?
in your only matchup with novak this year in davis cup he retired with injury. also in today's semifinal he called for a medical time-out, but still won. for tomorrow's final, are you going to take novak's possible medical time-out as part of the preparation?
can you talk about andy's body language and if seeing the way he looked on the court helped you at all mentally. also, we have two situations: no press, not so positive press. now that you have a chance, what do you want people to know about you?
do you think roger helps you in some sense in this semifinal? do you think simon will do the same thing? how do you recover in less than 22 hours for tomorrow's final?
you said earlier in the week that you didn't feel the miami tournament gave you any momentum because you weren't that happy with your year. i'm wondering if you're feeling a little better about the year. could you also assess roger and rafa in terms of expectations for next year, 2009? are they the players still to watch? what do they bring to the table, good and bad?
in general, roger and rafael, are they still the top two players, and what is there to watch about them?
are you feeling better about your year this year?
several players looked very exhausted. you are one of the players that played more matches during the year and look very fit. what's your secret? and given your recent experience in argentina, what's your opinion about what can happen at davis cup in mar del plata?
novak made us wait one hour after his match. you did your press conference 30 minutes after your victory. why are you so rushed?
how did it feel to play with your own racquet? you didn't play as good as last game.
if you could use one word to describe the week, what's that?
yes, the two games.
yes.
in roland garros this year you beat simon pretty badly. what part of his game made him difficult to play against?
what is your schedule? vacation or get ready for next year?
you will celebrate your 30th birthday at the end of this month. you're still good enough to be ranked 20 something. what is your secret? what is your target for next season?
shanghai will hold the atp 1000 event next year. will you come here again?
who will most probably win the masters cup?
not every player is happy with the hawk-eye system. what are your comments on hawk-eye?
did you play with your own racquet tonight?
did you enjoy playing in the match, and how much has it taken out of you?
out of all the points in the match, is there one that vividly sticks out in your mind now?
roger used a lot of slice shots and dropshots in the court. how did you take on his tactics today?
the crowd always seemed to be with federer; seemed unfair to you. would you make some comment on that?
did you go out there with a kind of live-for-today mentality and shut out of your head knowing which player you would face if you lost?
after eight match points, what kept you going, and what is your next goal?
talk a little bit about roger federer. there was a point like when pete sampras reached a point in his career where he wasn't considered by the other players invincible, they felt he was beatable. is roger at that stage now, that the players feel he's still great but he's much more beatable than in the past?
do you think one day you will be like an ambassador of tennis like roger federer?
how much of a distraction was it, federer clearly having a problem with his back?
roger said if he pulled out this match, the worse player would have won. would you agree you were the better player on the court?
he said if he would have won that match, he believes that it would have been the case that the worst player on the court would have won the match. so he considered you the better player on the court. do you agree with that?
what happened to your finger? does it hurt?
will it affect tomorrow's match?
did it feel like a great match to you? is it one of the better matches you played this year?
will you eat tonight, or what will you do about eating or sleeping?
i noticed you were taking some pace off the ball, especially in your first two service games of the second set. can you talk about how that fit into your strategy as a whole today.
later in the second set when you started missing the backhands into the net, first serves, was there a point when it stopped being technical and started getting in your head? how did you turn that around in the third set?
just as you promised two days ago, roger was knocked out for the first time in seven years. do you think this could be a sign for the younger generation to emerge on big stages like grand slams and masters cups? roger lost three grand slams this year. it never happened before.
it's your first time to get into the masters cup. how do you feel about your first match and your first semifinal? do you feel nervous? what do you think about your chance to win the championship?
give us some comment on the crowd. they're always with you whenever you perform.
was there any stage in the match when you considered quitting?
can you tell us how your back was.
it's a pity this is your last match of the 2008 season. could you give us some comments on the whole season of 2008.
at the end of the first set you looked in a pretty good situation. what happened at the beginning of the second? was it a mental letdown, or...
if you had gone through, how much energy would you have to play tomorrow and how much energy do you think that match has taken out of murray?
you won the us open this year, but you could not get the title masters series under this masters cup. i think it is not enough for you. do you agree with this?
can you break it down for us about your back, how much it affected you, at what point it was bothering you the most, if it affected your serves, groundstrokes, volleys, your strategy?
would you say this is the strongest top 10 we've had in many years? are you excited about next year?
it's early days, but is it possible that you and andy murray could develop into a similar sort of rivalry you've had with rafa?
how much do you think that might have taken out of murray today?
it's your first time to shanghai. what is your impression of the city? we see almost all the crowd here supported you during the match. what do you want to say to them?
you obviously probably lost the bigger one of the matches you played with novak, but you've won the last three. what is it about his game that you seem to be able to handle so well?
you finished this season with a win. looking back at the whole season, how do you take the success you made in 2008?
you were disappointed when you couldn't play the french. you had to have the knee surgery. you were on such a high. were you concerned that maybe the year wouldn't go as well as it ended up going for you once you came back? were you worried you wouldn't come back after the knee surgery as strong as you have?
according to the reports of the french newspaper, nadal predicted the top eight for next year. two of them will be you and gasquet. how do you take that?
you lost to tsonga three times. why?
any more reasons?
in the third set you lost 1-6. have you ever considered when you lose this match, you won't get the chance to win all the prize money?
despite tonight's loss, you seem much more comfortable here this year than last year when you didn't even win a set.
for about a set and a half you looked like you were playing right at the top level of your game. how would you assess the overall performance?
last year we saw more of a fun side or joking side to you. this year you seemed more subdued or more serious. is that something you were conscious about? can you explain it?
there was a pretty girl sitting in the stands beside your coach. is she your girlfriend? we don't have you ever introduce her in the public.
if murray beats federer tomorrow, it will be the first time ever we don't see roger in the semifinal in the masters cup. do you think it's going to be a new era for the younger generation to do some big breakthroughs?
it seems that roger and even rafa, who is not here, andy murray, are getting more of the attention this week than yourself. do you prefer to go under the radar, not be the focus?
you just mentioned you have no pressure, when you don't have all the attention, you will play better. today tsonga played better because he got more support from the crowd. is it because he has no pressure at all because he didn't qualify?
that was a pretty good performance. can you play much better than that?
can you tell us how you feel about reaching the semifinals, and who would you prefer to play?
you're in the semifinal, but we also see andy murray is in the semifinal in his first masters cup. djokovic also. gilles simon also has a chance. can you give us some comments on the new generation of tennis.
can you talk about the momentum or the importance of winning miami for you this year. it's like the fifth biggest tournament, or so they say. did that give you a lot of confidence? how important was that for you?
novak seems a little bit more serious this year than last year. last year he was doing all his imitations. do you notice that about him at all?
i remember the new racquet you had in miami. are you still using the same? can you talk a little bit more about it.
some guys say the season is too long and they feel tired right now. it seems you never complain and you always have good physical situation. you also have few injuries. how can you do that?
i would like to know, during the game, your racquet actually was not from your sponsors. is it something you borrowed from djokovic? also the socks you were wearing were from murray. from the very beginning, you weren't able to get ready for yourself as an alternate. what do you make of it?
did your contact lenses get lost, as well?
everything had arrived by this morning? it came through customs this morning?
who did you borrow your socks and your racquet from?
as we know, andy roddick is getting married next year. we wonder when do you plan to hold a wedding with nicole vaidisova?
roddick said about 10:00 this morning he phoned you that you better be ready. what were you thinking about when he told you about this?
you have played with roger federer four times this year alone. do you think this year's roger is more beatable than between 2004 and 2007 when you two played against each other four times and he defeats you each time?
we all know that playing with roger is difficult because he is the one who has the most fans in the stands. how do you take your time on court? did you enjoy your time in shanghai being one of the alternates playing the masters cup?
i didn't understand the story with the contact lenses. did you play without?
but they were stuck in customs, you said.
how will you go into your next match knowing you probably have no chance to qualify to the semifinal, but you still have an impact on who will qualify in that group?
have you heard about andy roddick pulling out?
what's your reaction to that? how do you think it affects your chances for qualifying?
could you give us a view into next season going into 2009? how you see it panning out for you? and, of course, given the financial crisis, whether it has any concerns.
in today's match you had the same chances to break, but you wasted too many chances. why?
since andy roddick dropped out of the tournament, you'll be playing with stepanek. do you think that will be much easier to play with him compared to andy?
can you just talk about the level of tennis that andy murray is playing at the moment. how well is he playing?
from love-4 down in the first set, did you change anything to break back? did you change anything about your game, or did you just execute it better?
this is the first time you have played in the masters cup. is the feeling different than playing in other tournaments like grand slams or other masters series?
bit of an unusual situation today. usually when your opponent pulls out last minute you have a walkover. how did that affect you? when did you find out?
last year you lost your first match and then went undefeated through the rest of the championship. are you tempted to look that far ahead and think perhaps you could do the same thing again in successive years?
andy murray said he would like to beat you and knock you out of this competition. what is your comment on that?
you said you were feeling sick yesterday. could you give us a little bit of an idea of what happened, and how did you feel out there when you were playing tonight?
you said earlier this year in dubai that you were surprised that andy murray hadn't changed his game a lot; that he was still basically a fairly defensive player. would you say with his progress this year, has he changed much as a player?
the situation on friday is slightly unusual in that andy has already qualified and you haven't. how might that change the match, do you think? you'll go in with a much stronger attitude than he might?
what do you think about the davis cup? who will be the winner now?
could you give us a sense of the speed of the court, how it's playing, and how difficult it might be even for an attacking player, how difficult it is to hit through this court.
what was the difference out there today between the two of you?
are you frustrated because it was so close? i guess your chances of making the semifinals now are pretty slim.
what do you think, the towels were given to you in a timely fashion?
after your win in paris you seemed very confident. someone picked you to be one of the guys who could make a big surprise in this tournament. with two losses, you could be the first one to be eliminated from the group. what happened with the last two games that you couldn't win both of them?
so you will be playing with novak djokovic in the next game. will that be the first win for you in the shanghai masters cup?
is it difficult to play in the masters cup, this being your first trip? a round robin tournament, is it more difficult than the regular tournaments?
in the two matches you had, when you served, you were broken in both matches. then you broke back in two games. then later on you didn't have this kind of case. i would like to know afterwards, only when you were broken could you break back.
first out last year and first in semifinals this year. do you feel happy right now with the breakthrough of this year?
what went through your mind at the start of the second set? obviously a big difference to what went on in the first set.
after the first match you said you learned so much from last year, even though you didn't win a match. could you please elaborate a bit? what did you learn from last year's experience, because we see a big difference between two years?
some comments or your next opponent, tsonga, because he's at edge of repeating what you have been through last year. i'm sorry we keep talking about that.
i'm just wondering what your thoughts are on the financial crisis and how it would pan out moving into the next season, given that your family has actually come out and rescued one of the tournaments. how do you see it pan out?
well, big news. there was a rumor reported by the english newspapers that you were almost kidnapped by some people because of the problem in kosovo. is that true, or how do you comment about this?
anything?
it was a very close match. could you have done something differently in the end?
you were saying the other day about how you're trying to stay the same for the whole match, not be nervous. how did you do with that today? looked like you had a good time with a few points, showing more positive emotion on the court. did you feel like you were having a good time today?
do you think novak's form is good enough to win the whole thing? and also, please comment on your next opponent, also.
the match against del potro will be like a quarterfinal. does it feel different from a regular quarterfinal because you have already lost a match?
the match that you played in buenos aires, is it a factor here, the davis cup match?
in the early stages of the second set, did you think novak was maybe time wasting a little bit?
you already had against tsonga a set point in the first set, with a backhand volley that was not very difficult, but you missed it. is it very frustrating with these backhand volleys?
last year when you came to shanghai you were surrounded by negative news. i remember in the round table so many journalists wanted to talk with you. this year you cleared your name. which would you more prefer?
did you decide your schedule before the australian open next year, what tournaments you're going to play, if anything?
so you're happy maintaining your world ranking between 4 and 6. what would be the major challenge to become the top three player. you haven't won a grand slam yet. when is the time for you to win a grand slam?
i'm wondering what was your reaction when you found out that you qualified for the event and then that you were playing federer in the first round? how did you prepare?
not many people are able to beat roger federer. you've beaten him both teams you played him. talk about how that feels and also what you think you have in your game to beat him, what bothers him.
i would like to ask you in the eighth game in the decider, you were leading, and you were trailing behind and then you came back. what were you thinking about? in the third set, the eighth game of the third set.
could you please compare this match with the toronto one. roger said his service is not that powerful because he was conscious with his back. do you feel so?
as the one who qualifies for the masters cup at the last second, what's your reaction and emotions to make one of the biggest upsets in the history of masters cup, to beat roger, who won here like four times?
you beat roger federer once. people might call it an accident or surprise. now it's the second time. what would you call it?
i would like to ask you, i notice that during the game a few times you were trying to smash your racquet but you controlled yourself. what were you thinking about? you thought actually you need to be more patient with roger federer, considering that he's been suffering from his back pain?
when the game was going to the third set, were you confident that you will win the game? if the match is a bit longer, is it easy for you?
how tough is it to get rhythm in a match like that? what gave you the most trouble today?
more than a year since you played murray. how different was it today than last time you played him? has his game changed much?
you served 78% first serves in and still got broken three times. how do you rate his return?
it's kind of a unique situation that you get to come back after a loss. how hard is it to put this one behind you and come back pumped up for the next match?
how do you see your upcoming match versus roger? are you surprised he's going into that match with a loss?
does it make your task easier that he maybe doesn't have the confidence he had after a win, or does it make it more difficult because he can't afford to lose another match?
roger said a little bit earlier today that gilles simon was a different player. he had something different than a lot of other players. how are you going to approach him, how you see his rise in the last couple months?
yeah. how do you approach gilles simon as a player? what will be different? roger said simon was different. he said he was tough to play.
apart from the second set, which was kind of weird, the rest of it looked pretty controlled domination.
given it's your first experience of this event, how did you actually find it? you looked a trifle weary at the end. would that be a fair summing up?
what is the surface and the conditions like out there?
is it fair to say with federer obviously losing tonight, struggling a little bit, that your group's pretty wide open?
would you expect a harder match against simon than you had in madrid? he was pretty tired after some really long matches there, wasn't he?
during the past few months there are some very good comments that you might win a grand slam in 2009 by mcenroe and bjorn borg as well. how do you take care of your own mind under those appreciations to perform on a very relaxed level on the court?
you are not concerned at all about the davis cup final, but i would like to know your opinion, who is your favorite? what could be the key factor?
how much was your back a problem today?
can you talk about, is there something he does in those two matches that you played that particularly bothers you, how it happens?
you're up a set and a break and everything seems okay. what happens at that moment? do you feel you let a little bit down, the pressure?
you were in this situation last year, weren't you, too, losing your first match. you still got plenty to play for. just your thoughts moving forward?
how do you compare today's match with the toronto one?
how is your back today? were you troubled by that at all?
you had less than 50% first serves and your overhead sometimes you had problems. was that unconsciously you were thinking a little bit, you were careful with the back?
as you pointed out, this a unique tournament because you get to come back even if you lost. and last year you were in a similar situation. how difficult is it to put aside this loss and then kind of like be up for the next match?
i'd like to hear some of your comments on the election of the new president of atp. there was rumors one of the nominees is larry scott, who is the president of the wta. he has a new plan to reunite the atp and wta to be one tour.
what takes you so long? have you celebrated in the locker room yet?
it was a very intense match. how do you judge the level of the match?
what was the key? what did you do better than him, in your opinion?
do you realize it is your first victory in the masters cup?
how do you feel about that?
you talked about experience just then. can you sort of tell us a little bit how different it feels this year as opposed to last year.
if i'm right, you are the first player ever to show the chinese learning ability in front of fans on the court.
you said thank you in chinese. how did you learn your chinese? is it a new way to sell yourself? we know there are some tensions between you and the american fans, and now you have to get along with the chinese fans, which is very important because we have the largest amount of fans in the world for tennis because we have the largest population.
could you tell something about that.
where did you learn your chinese?
could you compare your opponent with the one you played last time more than one year ago? what is the biggest difference?
yes.
you were very clear about the difference of experience between you and juan martin. i want to ask you if you think that he's in place of losing the three games as you last year?
i would like to know your opinion about the davis cup final. do you dare to give a result for the final?
which will be the key for you, in your opinion?
if someone had said to you after paris that you'd be sitting there with that trophy, what would you have said?
you looked very comfortable on grass. do you feel comfortable? moving well? hitting the ball well?
going into wimbledon, how different do you feel about the prospect of wimbledon this year as opposed to this time last year?
is your serve the biggest improvement from a year ago?
you seem by the majority of people in tennis as clay court king. now your name is on the trophy with some of the greatest grass court players of all time. what does that actually mean to you?
what do you plan to do for the next few days?
just relax?
when will you come back?
what do you think your uncle will be thinking sitting at home knowing you won a grass court tournament?
after all this tennis you've played leading to this point, are you mentally or physically tired? do you think that might come in the next couple days?
how is your hand?
djokovic is a big rival of yours at wimbledon. what was the difference today?
do you think somebody in halle might have noticed your result today?
does this confirm to you in your own mind you can win wimbledon?
did you grow up watching wimbledon and did you dream at that time you'd be a winner one day?
you had chances in both sets. what happened?
do you feel you're closing up right behind him now, certainly on grass?
the match seemed to be played at a very intense level, which is always the case when you two meet. i suppose it's possible, depending on how the draw works out, you could meet in a wimbledon semifinal or final.
will you stay in england?
were you impressed by the level of nadal?
do you need a bit of a rest as well this week, after three intense weeks?
you could do with some good weather at wimbledon.
can you tell me what difference it will make arriving at wimbledon that first day as a grand slam champion this year?
at wimbledon you can be the no.2 in the ranking. do you think it's possible?
you said you seem comfortable in london. you mentioned there are a lot of things to do. why are you comfortable here?
what have you found to do in london?
impressive?
do you feel you lost your crown today?
you've dominated queen's club for so long. do you think that's it?
do you feel you lost your crown, because you were king?
from what you've seen from him here, would you say his game on grass has improved the last 12 months?
what is the most emphatic quality that comes across the net? is it his pace across the court? is it the weight of shot?
is he hard to read down the court because of the fact he is unorthodox with his selection of shots at moments where you would expect something to come this way, he can take you out the other side?
you probably haven't had the week you would have liked with just one set against mardy and a walkover against andy. you wanted more of a physical workout.
might rafa have caught you today when you're still kind of lukewarm without being warmed up yet?
with another week to get yourself ready, with djokovic, roger, nadal, one or two others, how good a wimbledon can we anticipate with the mix this year?
do you feel, given that, you might find yourself a little bit under the radar, maybe a bit underrated going in?
if there is one thing you could take out of that match, from your point of view?
if there's one thing you can take out of that match today, what would you take out of it, from your point of view?
from any angle.
how relevant to the grass was it, what happened to you in rome? you were playing really well on clay. does it have any bearing? you were moving really well on the clay, looked good.
does that have any relevance to how your grass court season is going to go? wrecked your buildup.
what sort of hours on the practice court have you been putting in?
and here with the walkover and a one-set? no extra?
do you look to step that up through next week?
by your own high standards, that was good today, wasn't it?
do you feel tired yet?
how many days will you have at home? four days? five days?
you're looking more comfortable on the grass. is there a danger you're becoming a grass addict, not like marijuana, but?
if you were at home tomorrow in manacor, could you talk us through your day, what you would do?
if you were at home. you would get up, play golf, have lunch? talk us through it.
it looks like yourself, federer and djokovic are the three contenders for wimbledon. do you think andy murray can upset the three of you at all?
are you slightly disappointed you didn't have a chance to play him today?
had you played him today, it would have been a fun day, would it not, with the crowd on his side, big contest for you?
do you think he would have given you a tougher game?
do you ever think back to last year's wimbledon final, back in london, on the grass courts, how well you played against roger, how close you were? do you give that any thought?
can you compare your level of confidence on grass, not so much after wimbledon last year, but when you were playing here last year, to what you feel now, your level of confidence on grass?
do you feel more popular with the supporters this year?
playing karlovic yesterday, the big server, did that help today to get your timing playing against roddick?
silly question. how much part of you being very happy at this tournament is your favorite spanish restaurant you go to every night?
he was over in your box today.
what is your favorite dish?
give us one.
in one sense, are you a little bit surprised with yourself, with the way you played over here, coming straight off the clay after so many titles on the clay?
second set you only dropped four points on your serve.
when you're fishing, what do you fish for?
are you successful? are you very good?
never catch the octopus?
must be very disappointed to lose one game there, that was very sloppy.
did you feel he was struggling?
did he give you any indication afterwards that he was injured at all?
how do you feel about playing nadal?
do you expect it to be more like some of your hard court meetings than your clay court meetings?
i appreciate it's a different surface, but what happened in paris is out the window when you go on court against him in this match?
have you noticed any weak spots, anything you can exploit?
did wimbledon last year teach you anything about preparation?
yes.
after that experience last year, did you actually watch the final?
you avoided watching it purposely?
how do you feel andy is going to do this year in wimbledon?
can you detail the aspects of grass court play you're more comfortable with this year than you might have been last year?
your posture, biomechanics, everyone says it's probably the best there is in the game. movement on grass, has that been tricky for you or has that always been easy?
would you like to see more than four weeks of grass court tennis or is that enough for you?
there was a lot of back and forth during the match to see which side his serve was going to go?
your reaction afterwards showed how important it was to win. a good win for you?
in the last tiebreak, you looked very comfortable dealing with his slice. seemed to be like a coaching session for you where you were executing the forehand.
you were never troubled with the low ball?
can you describe what it is like receiving a serve from karlovic?
do you have to guess where he is going to hit it?
to be serious, you joked about friday night in mallorca. even for someone like you, who is such a competitor, how difficult is it after a long clay court campaign, you've come to have some good grass court preparation, wouldn't it be nice to have three days' rest?
so whatever happens, you are definitely going to go home for a few days?
you've got to go back?
we do have golf courses here.
did you mentally prepare before the match today it was going to go to tiebreaks, playing a big server?
does a win like that today show yourself how much you have improved as a grass court player in two, three years?
yesterday you complained a bit about your health. how do you feel physically today? how about your knees?
you weren't quite able to launch a comeback like you did yesterday. what do you put that down to today?
did you notice differences in his game on grass this time to wimbledon last year?
does a loss like that make you feel like you've still got quite a way to go for wimbledon or are you encouraged by how you've played this week?
everyone is talking about the aftermath of that final in paris last week, if the two of them meet up again in the wimbledon final. obviously novak is a contender now, isn't he?
how is the injury, the hip injury?
does the hip rule out the golf course?
normally next week...
next week will just be practice? will you play a couple of matches in the exhibition?
is there a difference at aorangi and wimbledon compared to here?
did you expect such an easy match?
much better match than your first one?
how similar or different was this match compared to when you played hewitt at wimbledon last year?
do you prepare some tactics before the matches?
alone or with your coach?
roddick was saying along with the top three and himself he thought maybe hewitt could still be a contender at wimbledon. do you feel that?
if it is david nalbandian in the semis tomorrow, how do you view that match?
everyone imagines the no.3 seed looks at the draw very carefully to see which half they're in and who they like to play during the course of a tournament. is that something you'll look at carefully next week?
disappointing to win that way?
is it disappointing also because you'd have liked a bit longer of a game, more time on court?
(question regarding pieces in the media indicating the injured shoulder, but that it was not hampering play too much.)
when it comes to having to play five sets, are you confident?
four wins, where are your priorities between winning this again and getting your shoulder moving on and ready for wimbledon?
do you consciously perhaps take anything off the serve or is it full out?
can you give us a little bit on your future possible opponents.
how have things been working out for you with your brother as your coach since the split with jimmy?
obviously you're a very experienced player now. how much do you actually pick into what your brother helps you with and how much do you draw from your own experiences?
was that part of the reason why it came to its end?
do you feel strong going forward to wimbledon now?
you were saying yesterday you hoped you'd be among the five put down as a possible wimbledon winner. apart from the three obvious ones and yourself, who would be the fourth?
the federer thing, obviously the guy won the thing five times, you said.
there were questions about his ability to win it again.
my question actually was, for somebody who wins four games in the final of a grand slam, is it likely to linger in his mind a lot?
you were quoted once after a wimbledon final saying you threw the kitchen sink at him and he chucked the bathtub at you. do you need to throw anything bigger at him these days to win?
he gave you a good match, didn't he?
how did you find the court? seemed to be slippery today.
murray was saying the same. he felt as though the conditions were a little risky, treacherous, especially the back of the court. did you think that was the case, rafa?
you skidded under the net at one point. has that ever happened to you before?
but your feet didn't go under the net.
did you recognize in his playing a little bit of yourself at 18 years old?
what are the strengths, the good things in his game?
is playing karlovic on grass something to look forward to or something to think that it's a horrible prospect, the huge serve all the time on a grass court?
not fun?
what does nishikori have to work on?
how is your body reacting going from clay to grass?
down to your knees?
kind of a dumb question. on tuesday for your doubles match, you were wearing a short-sleeved shirt and shorts. what happened?
how are the injuries? we worked out there were three.
when did you hurt the thumb?
are you going to have an x-ray?
did you inhibit your movement deliberately as a precaution after?
a lot of players are sliding. do you feel the courts are dangerous at the moment?
do you think you should have come off the first sign of rain? i think it was the fourth game in the first set. do you think you were allowed to play on and finish that game too long?
considering your problems, you must be really delighted in the fact that you won, played some good stuff?
when you sort of twisted and hit the deck, you hurt your groin and your neck, was there any sort of dj vu, 'not again,' after what happened last year? did you think about that at all?
how much of a concern is the thumb?
so how do you rate your chances of playing tomorrow?
have you made any representation or complaint to the referee about going on so quickly or the state of the courts? are you planning on doing that?
has anyone explained why the courts are so damp? shouldn't normally be like this.
did you at any point have a chance to speak to gulbis about it? do you know what he thought about the courts?
you mentioned andy's serve, the prospect of three sets of 140 mile-an-hour serves on that thumb. is that going to be a major consideration?
have you had a problem like that before?
yes.
so it's sort of difficult to assess how long it might take to get better?
did you say you thought you might come off at some point? is that what you said there?
can i just clarify when you asked to speak to the supervisor, was that in the first set or after you did the groin?
start of the third set?
how big a blow do you see this overall with wimbledon in mind?
how big a problem might it be then?
in broad terms, you're feeling good about the preparations for wimbledon?
who is your doubles partner and how did that happen?
there's almost no college graduates on the tour any more. i think john isner is the only one.
there's very few.
you've had quite a few injuries in a fairly short time. do you take it as being par for the course or do you think you're especially unlucky? looking further ahead, do you think, if i have this amount of injuries at this rate, it will hamper my progress in the long-term?
mats wilander said some nice things about you having the softest hands, softest touch of the ball since mcenroe. did you hear that? what is your reaction to hearing it? did you do anything as a youngster that sort of gave you that touch?
did you ever see the film the mighty ducks?
they used eggs to catch with hockey sticks to develop soft hands.
pleased with that?
three matches in, how do you feel you're progressing?
how big a part does confidence play in your sport? lots of other sports, they talk about when you're confident, the better they do.
obviously you had your time as world no.1. towards the end of that there must be a period where somebody chips an odd result against you here or there. that's happened to federer this year. will that make an impact on him, do you think?
i hate to throw it back when you're trying to build your confidence up at the moment. can you talk about what it feels like when that bit of invincibility you built up is suddenly being chipped away?
on the basis that nothing is forever, rafa is the next in line to make the big challenge?
roddick today said you would still be a big threat at wimbledon. do you feel that yourself?
does defeat hurt you as much now as when you were almost invincible?
when you used to go out there as world no.1, can i assume you thought you would win the match?
you still maintain that?
the andy seems to get the odd injury cropping up now and then.
with today's match, 1-4 down, what do you think actually clicked in? what turned it around?
2002, winning here, going to wimbledon and winning there, seem like yesterday or a long time ago?
when you pull up in the car at wimbledon, what do you feel when you get out? another year has gone by or it's still very special?
is the locker room attendant the same bloke from years ago?
a place you go to and think, i'm home?
you look at the next round. obviously you don't know who you have. do you look at the two players individually? you'd have another crack at djokovic on grass.
think back to the davis cup match against him?
your recent scores weren't so impressive, but here you already won some matches. the form looks like it's going up. how do you feel about yourself at this moment?
and your confidence?
and for a couple weeks from now, as well, for wimbledon?
did you learn anything at wimbledon last year that you will make you change anything this year?
i remember you saying you had to prepare well for wimbledon because of changes in the weather, different scheduling.
so you are familiar with london. do you go out here?
you were a set and a break down. how did you manage to turn things around today?
lleyton hewitt next for you. you have a history with him.
how do you feel about your prospects going into wimbledon this year? do you feel as good as you did this year or better?
do you think of the field as more open this year than the last few years?
every player has been slipping on the grass. murray said it was very slippery. nadal skidded with his feet under the net and lost a point. you seemed to have a nice line, rolling over and getting up. have you been watching boris becker, who used to be famous for that?
what do you feel you have to do to win wimbledon?
you could meet nadal here in the final or nadal in the semifinal or final of wimbledon. would you rather have the experience of playing him here first or would you rather go into wimbledon with him knowing less about how you're playing?
you mentioned when you came in about you were thinking about all the things during the first set. is that because it's so tough playing against a good friend?
how much does it bother you playing in the conditions you were playing in today: cold, late, half-full stands? does it bother you?
are you still able to enjoy a match like that?
happy with that?
what aspect of your game requires the most adjustment coming to grass? what do you work on most?
with the shoulder, is it a case of you still receiving treatment or do you just play and hope that it's fine the following day?
how do you work on the movement aspect? is it just something that comes as you play matches?
given the restricted amount of practice you're allowed, are you going to view after each match how the shoulder's reacting just to gauge yourself? you want to be in the best possible shape for wimbledon, but you don't want to not defend properly here either.
what will you do next week? are you practicing?
just talk us through the time scale between pulling up at rome, then you were saying the other day it was a compensatory injury that kept you out of the french. how long did you not touch a racquet for?
when did you start hitting again before coming over here?
that was just hitting in austin?
how would you rate your form compared to the same sort of time period going into wimbledon other years?
do you drop your tension for the grass court season?
how big a factor was playing here, the fact that you hold the title?
those days you weren't hitting, what were you doing?
are you a good scrabble player?
did you get the two-letter words?
you're slightly above average.
does being in london again, putting on this jacket, you feel comfortable in it, does that keep you...
have you tried playing there?
do you think the wimbledon draw is any more open than the last few years?
you have to see yourself up there with those two or three at the top?
yesterday sam querrey was obviously disappointed with his result. when you started on grass, you didn't like the surface. he's going through the same thing at the moment. how many years did it actually take you to feel you were comfortable and like the surface?
those shots you talked about, is that stuff that you just learned as the points go on or is it stuff you work on with coaches?
do you find this idea that because roger took such a beating on clay, somehow when he walks onto a grass court he's any less formidable?
i meant more from the mental side of it. we know he can play on grass, but...
with that sort of thing in mind, do you therefore forget all about last year's match with gasquet in the quarterfinals? is that something you don't think about at all?
how many times have you played on grass?
you played a davis cup match on grass?
this is your first tournament?
so it's going all right so far?
is it difficult to move sideways or forwards or both?
what about the speed of the ball up the court?
you played a lot of clay courts, hard courts?
what is your ranking now?
115?
do you hope to get into wimbledon?
main draw?
you should play rafael nadal next.
what do you think about that?
why do you like him as a player? what do you like about him?
what would you like to do in tennis? where would you like to go? do you have a target, win a tournament, get a big ranking?
nice to be on the grass again?
how much practice time did you have on the grass between arriving in paris and actually playing your match?
can you tell us what you did on sunday night after the french open?
champagne?
can you talk about the mental adjustment of playing on clay one day and practicing the next day on grass, how it is in the head to do that?
what is the best memory you have of playing on grass?
after the way in which you beat federer in the final at the french, bjorn borg, who's record you're threatening at roland garros, said he made you a favorite for wimbledon on the grass. how do you respond to that from a player of such class?
i don't think he made the comment lightly. i think he meant it.
having conquered the clay, how special would it be for you to add the wimbledon title? how special would it be to emulate the achievement of borg?
were you able to have any kind of quiet time on the train coming over from paris?
did you sleep?
some people are scared to go under the tunnel.
because they don't like the feeling of the water above. they're in the train. does it worry you at all?
any thoughts on your next opponent? i heard you practiced with him a couple years ago.
18.
when you beat somebody like jonas, who has a good record on grass, is that a quick confirmation that reminds you how good you can play on grass?
how do you think you shaped up today?
when you actually come here, do you feel you're at home? you won it so many times. lovely place, straight into the groove?
you adjust so quickly; you've done it for years. why is that?
what makes you a good grass court player?
have you had to change your game plan since you won wimbledon or is it a question of executing the same game plan successfully?
has grass court tennis slowed since you came on tour?
can you speculate as to why that change has happened?
in that week or two weeks that you started to hit again before the french, did you start to hit on hard or did you go to the red clay courts at homebush and start on that?
still only had a couple of matches on the grass. are you feeling with each one you're more comfortable or is it still new surface, got to settle?
playing the doubles obviously helps with that. is that something you might aim to put together that combination, you and gooch, for the olympics?
the doubles, in addition to getting more matches on, match practice, is it also a point to give fitzgerald another option for davis cup?
is that important for you, because playing for your country is so important? is it good to give something back in the sense you can help foster gooch's career a bit?
not much good to you really.
now you can go watch the [] spain game?
were you aware he was struggling before the warmup? were you aware early on?
how long will you practice this afternoon? will you use that as the sort of substitute match?
you win, but it's a letdown, isn't it, a match like that?
to finish with 136 mile-an-hour serve, isn't a bad way to do it.
must be happy with that. a decent speed to get up to in one service game.
did you watch the men's final on sunday?
what did you think of it?
considering what he did last year at wimbledon in this form, what do you think he can do this year?
do you think federer is still the favorite?
it was unlike him to lose a match in such a way. can other players take anything from that at all?
has he lost that air of invincibility that he's had?
you dispensed with the cap today. is that a new thing?
there's a lot of talk about grass court tennis slowing down. can you describe where grass court tennis now ranks in terms of speed compared to the other surfaces that you play on throughout the year?
do you take much notice of what the juniors are doing? the juniors are going down pretty fast.
the juniors, the british juniors, younger players, are getting taken out all over the place at the moment. are you watching that?
yes.
what are your expectations in this grass court season, given that you missed the corresponding period 12 months ago? have you set yourself goals as to what you want to achieve? aside from obviously wanting to win the tournament, what would you regard as progress?
do you think that's a realistic goal, like a quarterfinal, semifinal this year?
not quite the experience you were looking for. give us your impressions of the match.
were you feeling nervous out there with the size of the court, everything like that?
have you played much on grass in the last few weeks?
you were obviously well hacked off when you dropped a serve and sent the ball flying.
what took you at that point?
how big is the difference between this sort of match, you've been playing a lot of futures match, but i don't know how many challengers you've been playing, and a junior grand slam, for instance?
in the level, the opponents.
has that experience shown you how far you've got to go, the work required to get up towards the top hundred?
you mentioned qualifying rather than getting a wildcard. often british players get criticized for getting wildcards. do you think it's right you should get one and would you prefer to get one or would you prefer to earn your way into an event like this?
you feel, as you say, it has been a useful experience, that you've learned plenty from it?
what do you say to the many people from novak djokovic downwards that say that british players get given too much, or that it's too soft, the environment?
andy mentioned it in his book. i'm not saying he was referring to you. he said a lot of british juniors have the wrong attitude.
the wrong attitude, he said. the work ethic was wrong. that was murray himself.
in the last few months.
where do you go from here?
was it tough doing this kind of quallie-quallie thing?
looked really good in the first set. ahead in the tiebreak. what happened?
you have a really big serve. gonzlez was talking your serve up after the match. what do you think you have to do to play those kind of matches against guys like him more and also get the results?
excellent start. couldn't hold it together for the whole match?
can you give us an impression of what it's like to play a former grand slam champion on a center court in your home country?
have you been to his academy?
how long were you there for?
you're based here again?
where are you from in london?
a lot of us were very impressed, considering your ranking and your experience, how well you kept everything under control, how controlled your game was. did you exceed your own expectations perhaps today?
james, what needs to happen to take that next step up to where you are, taking those chances?
was the decision to go to spain a financial one?
who is your coach now?
can i ask why you weren't getting any help?
is someone like tim henman an inspiration in that when he was 21, he was ranked 250 in the world?
the lack of support, i take it you feel you're supported enough now?
why?
that's crazy, though, isn't it? we don't exactly have a proliferation of promising young players. feel like you're banging your head against a brick wall?
you may not want to say, but is there an example of something you asked for, you didn't get, and wondered why not?
is it an overwhelming feeling you took a set off marat safin or disappointment at losing the match?
there aren't many chances for young players developing to go and stand by a world no.1, a grand slam champion, at his academy, see what it takes. you obviously got an impression from him of what you need to do, the work ethic that is required to be as good as you can be.
doesn't put you off?
do you think britain has enough natural talent to challenge at the top level and it's not just channeled properly?
have you got any idea what the effect of qualifying for an atp tour tournament will do for your ranking?
would you ask for a wildcard for nottingham?
have you been given any indications as to whether you might get a wildcard?
are you going to put a phone call in?
obviously andy went to spain. you've gone to spain. do you think that's the most successful model? the lta should concentrate on financing people to go overseas and train?
do you think there's the same work ethic around the ntc that there is at an academy like the one you were at?
pretty comfortable match for you.
good to get the early break.
grass courts here are regarded by some as the best in the world. what do you think about that?
having been out for a while, i know you obviously prefer to be fully fit, but is there a bonus, do you come to this season feeling particularly fresh?
how do you feel physically at the moment?
because you said you struggled a little bit after a long match in paris, didn't you?
coming into wimbledon a bit under the radar, does that help?
the attention will be on the top three or four.
you were saying you're not a hundred percent. what percentage are you at?
looking at the top three you mentioned, how much of an effect do you think what happened in paris yesterday will have on roger at wimbledon?
you've always done pretty well here. how do you enjoy the atmosphere here compared to wimbledon?
you took on tony last year. tony said he wanted to work on your serve, add variety. with injuries this year and last year, how much quality time have you had with him?
if it wasn't wimbledon now, grass court season, would you be playing?
do you have a view on the wimbledon wildcards? wimbledon are due to announce today wildcards. the lta has said they don't want wildcards to be given to players ranked below 250 in the world. your opponent today, for example, wouldn't get one. i wonder if you have a view on that as a policy.
he made you work for it, but you got through okay. happy with that?
you've had a lot of trouble with him in the past. why?
how do you feel in terms of your form on grass compared to this time last year?
going into wimbledon, obviously we're looking a bit further ahead, that has to put you in a good mindset.
robby ginepri next up.
yes. you've played him once, but that was a few years ago.
interesting to match yourself up against him again?
lleyton has been through a lot on and off the court. when i mention lleyton, what's the first thing that comes to your mind?
you say he's a great guy off the court. earlier in his career a lot of players didn't get along with him. what makes him a great guy?
australia has a great tennis tradition. lleyton is the standard bearer for the past five, 10 years. must be a difficult thing.
do you get a sense of how his hip has been bothering him. i know during the davis cup he played with it. do you have a sense of how fit he is?
during the davis cup, did he pay for the flying transport of a cystic fibrosis sufferer?
how did you see that then, your game?
how did the back stand up?
moving on from here, you were talking about wimbledon wildcards. if you don't get one, will this give you confidence for qualifiers?
what did you think when you heard that the lta were recommending that players outside the top 250 shouldn't get wildcards?
was it only about a month, or six weeks ago, that you heard about that, the 250 rule?
as someone who has come through the system, why do you feel there is this continuing need for british players to have wildcards, second chances? do you not think we should be producing more? you look around some of the other european countries, the young players seem to be getting guys into the competition and we seem to be falling behind.
do you think we're not preparing our youngsters as well as some of the other countries?
how much of a target for you is the davis cup in september, getting into that team?
has he given you any indication he's looking at you?
good performance at wimbledon would go a long way to cement it.
how do you feel your year's going this year? are you happy?
when you look at what you achieved in 2006, particularly in qualifying for slams, have you been at all disappointed in your progress since then?
what do you put that down to?
coaching-wise, what's happening with you with that? you're at sutton?
was that a good move for you?
that was a pretty disappointing result. what are your feelings?
obviously looking at sort of the tournament last year, you had a pretty successful tournament. going out first round must be disappointing.
where are you now versus where you were a year ago? how do you feel about where you are now?
how has that switch affected your take on the game, working before with peter lundgren, his abrupt departure from the lta, now working with brad?
you mentioned you're playing nottingham. what are your expectations there?
regarding doubles, are you playing in nottingham?
fitness-wise, you feel good?
pretty tough to stop a legend while he's playing like that?
what's your overriding feeling after the match? obviously disappointment, but do you have some pride having got that far?
do you feel the deck was stacked against you? you had that match with nadal, obviously the no.1 seed sunday. now, no real rest while federer was very much rested for this match?
you were flexing the knee at certain points. was that an issue?
did losing those break points in the second set and thinking it looked clearly like you missed that shot, did that affect you later on? how did you put that behind you?
you moved to no.4 in the world, but do you feel a different player after this experience of this fortnight?
was there something in particular that he did better or differently than in any of your prior matches against him?
just on the hawk-eye system, do you think there is a case for extending its use, so it should be used all the time on every shot and every point?
as you were gaining momentum in the third set, you were getting some tremendous ovations from the crowd. what does that kind of support do for you either at that time or even as something you take with you as you leave here?
roger's on 13 slams and he's one behind sampras. do you think he can overtake him?
what can you learn from the experience of your first grand slam final, irrespective of how the actual match went, but just the circumstances?
mats wilander was telling me he felt he became a better player for even losing matches, even grand slam finals. can you see the logic in that in any way?
you said on court that you felt roger was the best of all time. if you had to boil it down just to one or two things that really allowed him to step up and be a player, what are those one or two things?
in your to-do list following these two weeks about what you want to do in your game, what would be the first couple of things at the top of that list which now need attention?
would you tell us the gist of what you said to him up at the net at the end of the match?
in the third round we asked you and you said you expected to be in the final, and that's why you weren't smiling and really jazzed about your early wins. how much did that help you today, that you expected to be here?
obviously you came here for the trophy. you're going away at 21 with a check for a million dollars. does it seem slightly unreal?
does this seem unreal to you that somebody's going to give you that amount of money at 21 years old?
your first slam. how big of an arena is arthur ashe for you to play that first slam in?
when you won in 2004 here, did you see federer play in the final?
so this very declining roger federer, three slam finals and one semifinal. how do you comment on it?
you hit the first serve of the ball game on the t . you seem to have a fondness for that spot.
was that your best serving in a long time?
when was the last time you played a set as cleanly as you played the first set today?
especially after being down 5-4 in that third set, you seemed to break more than just novak's serve, also his spirit with a lot of help from the crowd. do the ovations like that mean more to you this year given some the troubles you've had this season?
given the expectations you have of yourself and everybody has of you, now that you're in your third straight slam final, how would you describe your year?
how will you describe it if you win at the end of that?
out on court, you mentioned that it would be nice if you played rafa again. he's in big trouble now. is your thinking on that just it's a great rivalry, it's good for tennis?
can you identify, say, a key or "the" key moment in this match, the turning point, moment?
you said the other day you are becoming more emotional. you are showing more of your true face out on the court. seeing your reaction after the win today, it looks like there is pressure on you to prove to people that you are a still there. could you dispute that or confirm that?
a common observation right after the match was you looked like your old self. how do you react to that, and do you feel like your old self?
you looked very good physically. are you feeling as good or better than you ever have coming into a final here at the us open?
you weren't around when we had all the airplanes every day. was that a distraction, or did you wonder what was going on? they had the to use new patterns across here.
but you had heard about how it used to be?
is this your house?
you did a little dance out there at one time.
yes.
on the big point.
that's good.
you've fallen a little bit behind in your course to try and equal and also pass pete. do you feel like getting a victory in the final would really kind of get you on course for '09? and also, just talk about the history of potentially being not only be the person to win five straight here, but also in wimbledon, what that means to you.
i heard in the past you describe when you're playing well it feels like you're flying.
did it feel that way in the first and fourth sets today?
if you do play andy tomorrow, do you remember what it was like to contest for your first major, and can you put yourself in his shoes a little bit?
it seems ridiculous to even suggest that after all your grand slam success that there's any hint you have to prove yourself, but given this year after the things that have been said and written, do you feel any pressure to prove yourself tomorrow?
was roger just too good today, especially that first set?
is that the main issue, exhaustion physically, or were there other...
could you just elaborate a little bit on when you said that it's been an exhausting tournament mentally.
was there something specific physically today?
the crowd was certainly in roger's favor today. in retrospect, do you regret saying the things you did the other night?
they were even cheering when you had unforced errors. there were times they were cheering in the middle of your serve. did that rattle you?
was his serve particularly good today?
how much of a battle was it between your ears today? how frustrating was it knowing you didn't have probably everything you'd like to have and the whole general situation?
having played roger in three of the last five slams, how would you compare his level during those matches from last year's open through australia to here?
but do you look at him the same way today than you did a year ago when you faced him here in the final?
if you could change one thing about this year's us open, what would it be?
overall, how would you assess yourself...
about the summer as a whole with the silver medal.
how do you need to improve? what are the things you'd be working on?
you didn't do very well at all last fall. i know it's hard to think ahead right away now, but are you sort of looking forward to the fall to be able to make a good move?
as someone who made your first grand slam final here last year, what advice would you give jelena as she plays serena?
each grand slam is different and presents its own unique challenges. what would you say is the most difficult one for this tournament, having gone to the final last year and now the semifinal?
what did you learn about yourself this tournament and about new york fans?
you seemed very unafraid today out there. obviously you were serving big. what is it about roger federer now compared to previous years that perhaps you thought he could be beaten?
came in here, knocked off tommy haas and others after that match. you were talking to us and saying, you know, i've got nothing to lose. i'm just out there, i'm playing free, i'm surprised at how good i'm playing and so forth. is that really what's carried you? have you learned something about yourself and the attitude you bring to big matches in this tournament?
after the almagro match you had davydenko coming up and you said quite emphatically right where you are now, i really believe i can beat him. did you feel that way going into roger?
same way?
how much of that not having respect for him is because he's had spotty results all year? you've seen the guys he's lost to. does that give you more hope than you had two, three years ago?
did you hear him out there?
hear him? he was yelling quite a bit, which is unusual for him, you know, in frustration. you were making him do that.
was there anything he did or didn't do that surprised you?
is he playing the level that he can play at?
this run here, what do you think this will do for you going forward?
even though it may be difficult to reflect, how will you look back on this incredible run that you've had here?
no, i know it's difficult to reflect, but right now, when you look back at what you've accomplished, how do you think you're going to remember it?
is it true that you didn't have a hotel, that you had to switch hotels?
what was the story with that?
was that because you didn't expect to be here this long?
somebody offered you some giants tickets?
it's tonight?
nothing left in the tank to go?
i would think that that outing tonight might have a celebratory air to it. i mean, i know you lost tonight, but i would like to think that the people that care about you that you're going to participate in the celebration with tonight, it will be that, a celebration. i would think there's so much positive that you can ultimately derive out of this. do you see it that way, too?
you lost three tight sets, couple points here and there, each set you could have won in straight sets. is that a fair assessment?
do you see this tournament and the results of this tournament as possibly a springboard, if you will, to a second phase of your career? you're 25 years old. there is still...
a lot of the players have been talking this week about how different it is in this tournament than it has been in the past few years with roger not playing as well as he has in the past, that level, that invincibility aura sort of gone, different attitude going in playing him. would you say that you always felt that way, or do you feel it's really more about you having confidence in yourself? i mean, you faced him in 2005, so you know what it was like to face him at a high point in his career.
how does it feel to be in the semifinals?
there seemed to be a little wobble there.
did the match go as you hoped tactically?
are you pleased with your fitness?
can you recover okay, you think?
how did you regroup? what was going through your mind? it must have been a difficult mental challenge.
are you as calm inside as you've given the impression you are, both on the court and now, or are you getting a little bit excited? you don't seem tremendously excited to be in the semifinals.
do you have a preference about who you play?
can you compare the atmosphere to the gasquet atmosphere?
you always get a very good reception when you come on court. generally the crowd here are generally very supportive, even though you're not american. do you feel you have sort of a rapport with the people here?
if you were to play nadal in the semifinals, what did you learn the last two matches you played him?
can you talk about the conversation with del potro at the end of the match.
you've got good eyesight but your challenging tonight was a little -- well, you didn't win many, did you? are you surprised that sometimes what you think is a good call on your part seems so far out or so far in?
will you spend the next two days thinking about the semifinal or trying not to think about it?
how tough an opponent would mardy fish be?
do you think he's a good match-up for you tactically then, his aggressive style?
juan martin, his press conference couldn't continue, he broke down in tears and had to be led out of the room. he was very disappointed. he's 19 years old and he reached his first grand slam. can you relate to those emotions? because one would think perhaps he would be quite pleased with his performance in the tournament here.
what's your view about the semis and the final being back to back?
you've always set yourself different goals each year. improving grand slam performances was a key one this year. are you taking deep satisfaction yet that you improved your form, or are you going to wait until sunday?
a big day for your brother tomorrow. will you come in and watch him?
what was the situation with the screen?
you spent a lot of time at this us open grandstand court and armstrong court. part of what you saw on the screen, perhaps was part of that a little bit of unfamiliarity? if so, how good does it feel to be establishing yourself on center court?
obviously not the result that you would wanted to, but can you look at this tournament -- i mean, you came in, you were struggling and played very well and dispatched some very great opponents and played one today, you know, very tough match. i mean, can you feel pretty good about the tournament for you this past week?
how difficult an opponent did you find novak in terms of his shot making and so forth? describe how the match went between the two of you.
what did you find about your game? did you find something when you got here that maybe made a big difference compared to how you were playing in the tournaments leading up to the us open?
you were so upset with the linesman. why?
you sound like you don't believe djokovic's ailments . is that true?
some of the most spectacular tennis we've seen in this tournament so far. what was it like to be a part of that match?
this is in a way an improbable run. you've played some spectacular tennis, and to get this far you said the other day that you've developed an attitude that, hey, i have nothing to lose. is that what's helping you to prevail in these big matches?
you have won four of your seven matches against top-10 players now in your career. do you think maybe they take you too lightly?
we hear that you can't get through on the phone lines to luxembourg?
can't.
you've got your knee taped up, how are you feeling? how are your legs?
do you think you played tennis at the same level as when you beat andy roddick years ago, or better, maybe?
coming into the match, you came off of two long five-set matches. today was a four-setter that ran the length of a five-set match. it was a long and tough contest out there. are you feeling like you're holding up well in terms of your strength?
you said you've been playing qualifiers all year long, and we don't know what's going to happen out on the stadium right now, but there is a strong likelihood that you'll be playing roger federer in a semifinal match at the us open. is that something that if somebody had asked you that probability a week ago, you would have sort of thought they were nuts?
you're a fan of american football?
how big a deal would this be in luxembourg if you won this tournament?
yeah.
will there be a parade for you or something?
not too many, i mean, i think in the open era, probably a couple times somebody who was a qualifier has reached this level of a tournament.
i think he is. i think you're in a pretty rarified era. talk about that accomplishment.
did you think there was a chance you were going home today?
did he really surprise you tonight? and if he did, what did he surprise you with?
it seemed like a turning point in that match was that one point where he hit the dropshot. you raced in to get it, the crowd was cheering while you were running in. you lobbed him and then he missed the backhand. could you hear the crowd cheering as you were running? did you sense that was a turning point in the match?
you said on your on-court interview that you were happy with how you played tonight. and you seemed genuinely elated. i mean --
elated.
happy. a very high point in emotion, if you will.
do you really feel like, you know, this was, if you could just describe the feeling of the victory tonight? because you had some tough moments in the match.
it wasn't an easy match for you, but were you surprised at some of the choices he made, and especially from third set going forward? some of the decisions he made?
yeah.
many people are curious about your health situation. on a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you think you are over your mono that you were working on earlier?
going back to the second game of the final set, how much was the turning point emotionally for you? did you feel it was all downhill from there?
besides being really happy or elated at the end of the match, you showed a lot of raw emotion throughout the match, especially for you in the fourth round. i'm just wondering if that's sort of indicative of letting off steam from what's been a frustrating season?
i know you said playing the fifth set was fun, but you lose the fourth set, do you remember your emotions right at the start of the fifth set? and, you know, were you thinking, what do i have to do differently? what were you thinking going into that fifth set and losing that fourth?
gilles muller came into this tournament as a qualifier. he knocked off tommy haas, and then went on to beat almagro. he came into the press room and he said that he's coming in with an attitude that i have nothing to lose, i think i can beat davydenko, and he came out and beat him today in really a remarkable display of tennis. how dangerous is an opponent like that, who feels so empowered, you know, in that he doesn't have anything to lose, really?
how are you feeling?
how's your hip?
after the match, your mother sort of hit her heart and you did that, then you hit everything else.
did you feel residual results? i mean, coming off of that late-night match coming in today, did you, starting out even in the first set, did you feel like you had less in the tank than you would ordinarily like?
how's your ankle? your right ankle?
given all this, do you wonder how you won that match?
was there any moment where you thought of pulling out? you really looked spent.
which match was tougher, this year's or last year's against stepanek first round?
what did you do to your hip? what exactly happened?
whoever wins, it's going to be a tough match, tough opponent in the next go around. the fact that you're able to, you know, wake up this morning, not feel well, come to the stadium and prevail under very difficult conditions, i mean, can you draw some confidence in that, whether you face fernando or andy in the next round?
here they play the semifinals and finals back to back. if this was a semifinal, how would you feel going into the final, if this had been a semifinal today?
how do you feel about the back-to-back semifinals and finals?
well, you play on saturday semifinal here and final sunday. other grand slams you have a day between.
do you plan to watch the roddick match tonight? if roddick does win tonight, what are your thoughts on potentially facing him next round?
last year the crowds loved you. you were doing the impersonations.
i know. this year you mentioned they were in favor of robredo? does that surprise you? and why do you think that is?
was it a match of your career today?
was your girlfriend, maria kirilenko, in the stands?
did you have a chance to call her, to speak with her?
seemed like a big turning point was when he tracked down the dropshot and then lobbed you, and then you raced back to hit the lob and hit it out. the crowd was kind of cheering for him as he was running towards the ball. did you sense the crowd cheering? did you feel that was a big turning point?
could you say, how did you approach the match tactically? what was the plan for this?
was the crowd a big factor? seemed like they really got behind him especially after he lost the first set. did the crowd affect you?
looking back at some of the decisions you made during the match, do you think you could have done better? do you think looking back that...
does a match like that make you feel you've really arrived?
seemed like things when were most tense you kind of swung more freely than ever. did it feel like that? could you talk about that ability to stay relaxed and hit strong?
in that marathon game, i'm sure you would have rather have closed it out, but is there satisfaction having kept him on the ropes that long?
the other day you talked about goals almost in comical terms, in television terms, of being out on the court when networks were on. can you now change those goals?
you seemed to do so well when there's a lot of attention on you in a big moment, big stadium like this. what's it take to make that result more consistent and carry it through the rest of the year so you can get the ranking up?
anything you need to change or do just to keep it going?
were you having fun?
were you as calm as you looked?
no, no, but i mean as it...
what surprised you about him and what impressed you most?
could you talk a little bit about what you think the cause of the nerves was at the outset? was it the opponent or the setting, the whole...
the crowd really got behind you. did you become aware of that?
who were the samurai warriors in your box?
do you think they feel it was worthwhile making the trip out?
is there a feeling of being in with a monster, i mean, something you've never seen before?
how do you see mardy's chances against nadal the way he's been playing this week?
i'm curious if you have any nieces or nephews so that we know whether you're actually uncle sam?
we're kind of into this american thing.
in the second and third set there, especially before the tiebreaker, looked like you were fitter than rafa today. did you feel like you were fresher? he seemed to be dragging a bit.
if there's one particular shot you had more success against him with, what would that be, or where was his weakness?
obviously you had a great year in 2008 and a good run in this tournament, too. so many people are talking about you. i'm wondering, do you think it is because you are a rising star or simply you're coming from asia, because we don't have so many male players, good players that are asian at this time?
we don't have so many good players in asia especially male, so many people are talking about you because you had a great year. do you think it is because that you are rising star or the reason is you come from asia?
so do you consider yourself as rising star or someone who can enter into top 10 someday?
you have the confidence, right?
what do you take away from this tournament, your experience here?
you are a young star, i would say, so do you have any particular players that you are looking up to or someone that you admire?
in your mind, you're going to stay and live in florida, or it's possible one day you come back in japan?
what do you know of the history, tennis history in japan? do you have a model, a japanese player that you followed?
how would you evaluate tonight's match? you were able to get your racquet on a lot of balls that he hit. did he overwhelm you? he was so big and serving so hard. how did you feel?
by the time of next year's us open, where do you hope to be by then as far as your career, your accomplishments?
you have a lot of japanese fans, of course, but do you feel any pressure from the fans and expectation in japan and here at all?
how difficult was that match?
did he impress you?
how much did the olympics help your confidence at hard courts? this look like the most comfortable you've ever been here so far over the years.
when you come into a grand slam, do you anticipate that, yes, there will be one match maybe in the middle where you won't be playing so well and you'll have to fight a lot and be fighting against yourself?
do you feel fully recovered from the travel from beijing?
the atp is making a change with etienne having left. you are now in a position of power within the atp.
can you talk a little bit about what you would like to see this new person to do most importantly when he or she comes in?
will the schedule be one of the things, one of the problems?
how fresh do you feel going into the quarterfinals now?
can you talk about what will the keys be to playing fish? he'll be is different type of player, a lot of serve and volley and attacking the net.
how much does the excitement of new york city fire you up now? you must be enjoying the big apple?
last year when you were here, you were very concerned about the health of your knees, especially at hard courts. have you solved that problem? are your knees feeling better?
many people have said your victory over roger at wimbledon was the best match in tennis history. when you think back to the match and everything that happened, and greeting your family and the spanish royalty, what was the most special moment or memory that you have from that match, that experience?
could you see then? at that time, could you see what was going on? it was dark.
terrific win.
but do you think you're in the 1970s or something, serve and volley? are you in a time lapse?
how tough is it to keep an attacking kind of sensibility when you've got guys who play so powerful from the baseline? do you have to actually force yourself to...
what's it like to be doing well as an american in this tournament with this crowd and so much attention to the us players?
afterward you almost looked a little emotional. was it just the sun in your eyes, or what were you feeling out there?
hadn't you expected this sort of thing several years ago for yourself?
since beating james saturday night, has he said anything to you about the rest of the tournament, given you any kind of...
you looked strong there, very strong mentally in the last couple matches. is there an explanation or reason for that?
you've used the word "desperately" twice now, on court and here. it's a pretty strong word. is there a feeling that time is running out?
i guess the next big question for you is if you play your top level, your attacking style, do you have the confidence to really hurt nadal?
after playing james on this stage on saturday, do you have a more empathy for what the williams sisters go through in slams, especially here? can you even imagine what they deal with when facing each other?
you talked about mental toughness, and in any sport you need it. was it something that all of a sudden just clicked in, or was it a process that it evolved? when did you realize, now i got it.
that night match, you served for the match, and everybody said, oh, my god. you're down 4-2 in the breaker. was that a defining moment in your career to pull that out?
what will you do tomorrow, find a lefty to hit with?
you've been talking a lot about friendships in the press conferences. the other day you mentioned your friendship with andy was slightly different than with james. just talk about your friendship.
how important is it for a guy like monfils or some of the other guys that play so much from the baseline to actually have a small window of opportunity rather than be able to load up and go for winners from the baseline?
when your ranking was down around 300, did you have doubt you would get back to this level, and what was that process like for you?
you seemed very much in control out there today. are you quite pleased with the way you handled the match?
how much of any athlete's, particularly tennis players, makeup is the confidence you bring to the game? as opposed to the physical part? are you believing in yourself now?
was there any point during the olympics at all that you, for whatever reason, regretted your decision not to go and what did you watch and how much did you watch?
is this match something to lift your game at this moment, like down a break with gulbis down a break here? is that what you're talking about?
you're a baseball fan, and you hear guys say, mr. october, certain people can produce when the pressure is on.
same thing in tennis?
any sport?
what month are you?
you pick one.
that was going into the tournament. now, as you do advance into the latter stages, you know, and the pressure gets tougher and so forth, can you begin to at least draw back and say i have been able to do it before?
murray thanked his fitness coach on court last night. is having a traveling fitness coach now pretty much a requirement if you want to be in the top 10?
what is the physical report, your shoulder and your back?
fair.
fair. i'm on a crutch.
absolutely. i wouldn't want to play you today?
you're okay, though?
everything's fine?
i have a follow-up on that shoulder question. has it only been recently you've been able to play the matches without having any worry about feeling a tweak or twinge or...
is that specific to serving or...
is it tendinitis?
do you think that's something you're going to have to deal with as long as you're playing competitively?
on court you made a funny comment about all the success, all the jobs that pat mcenroe has. what qualities does he bring that has made him so successful and that you enjoy in terms of working with him?
along those lines, the atp is looking for a new leader. what would you like that person to be like, and is there one...
is there one issue, andy, that you would like that person really to tackle when he or she comes in?
you've been on both sides of fan support. i mean, j block had a warning last night in the match. do you think that someone's fans can go too far in a situation like that?
so the umpire was out of line?
did you watch the match last night, and if so, was it very difficult between close friends?
do you think the code of conduct is a bit too much, bit too strong, so if a guy cracks his racquet down the court, so what, there's no harm?
the match, here's a guy you hadn't played before. doesn't have much of a serve. blasted him in the first set. did he pick up his game a little bit or did you change yours?
nieminen or gonzlez, you've never played nieminen --
no athlete wants to think he's really got it going, but do you believe you've got it going? you obviously are pleased that now you're into the fourth round, and moving along and you sort of in your mind say, could be?
do you look at, think about federer differently at all? i mean, he still made two grand slam finals this year. he's won a couple tournaments, but he's not playing the way he has over the last few years.
you talked about how -- you say you'd love his bad year. but the way you feed off this place and your history here and the way you say you're going in the right direction, i mean, do you view this as i guess your best shot at another slam final?
obviously only two breaks of serve the whole match, four hours. when you were serving the ball, did you feel more confident with it or a lot of pressure on you because almagro was holding so well?
could you talk about the emotion you felt on that match point. it was a great sort of drop volley you hit and you really got up in the air?
why are you winning these matches?
yeah.
you reached the round of 16, if i'm not mistaken, for the first time in a grand slam event.
that's got to be, you know, quite a feeling of accomplishment.
you face davydenko in the next round. your thoughts on that?
do you feel you're a much better player now than you were the last time you faced him, the way you're playing right now in this tournament?
did you have any sense that you could play so well here? did you come in feeling things were coming together? how was your state of confidence coming in to play qualifying, and then as you rolled along, could you just describe that?
how important is the crowd when you're down two sets to love? there's a kind of fickleness that, hey, they just want the match to go on longer. but could you feel the energy from them?
where does this rank in the sports history of luxembourg, you think?
are you getting any text messages or calls or anything from home, parents, friends, guys on the tour who are on the challengers saying, hey, what's going on?
this has probably added another year financially to your game, right? that means so much to just have that pressure taken off?
technically though, what's been really working well for you here from a technical point of view?
lefty?
does this surface help you, you feel?
not to get ahead of ourselves here, because obviously it's going to be a tough match against nikolay, but it's not unreasonable to see you playing a quarterfinal match against roger federer. it's not out of the realm of reality. if somebody had told you, you know, a week ago today that you may be playing roger federer in a quarterfinal match, would you have thought them nuts?
do you think right now anything is possible?
when you beat roddick, is this really a matter of having your confidence, or have there been things in your game, but now that you have the confidence these past couple of matches, it's helping you even more?
you seemed to have very few unforced errors on your forehand side today. that's been an issue since wimbledon. is that something you've been working on?
you've come in here last several years with an aura almost of invincibility. obviously coming in this year a lot of the players are talking about, hey, james blake was saying the other day rafa has every reason to be confident. other people are saying maybe there is a chink in the armor. do you think in the course of one two-week tournament, with commanding performances like you had today, you can reestablish that aura by the latter rounds, should you get there?
do you have that in mind when you're out there playing, to send a message, essentially, you know, in these earlier round matches so should you...
to play radek, who did beat you earlier, albeit earlier on clay this year. is there a special satisfaction in going out and beating in straight sets one of the nine who did beat you earlier in the year?
now that etienne has decided to step down and you're a new board member, can you discuss the qualities that you would like his replacement to have? and is there one chief issue that you would like that person to really focus in on?
how did you feel going in today? you obviously played a great match. fewer errors and you only lost serve once. did you really feel on from the get-go?
it's been so long since you've not been in the second week of a major, in fact even in the final weekend in a major. do you remember what you did the last time you were not in the second week of a major?
kuerten at the french, third round.
yeah.
we're approaching the end stretch of the season. what would you consider a successful season for you this year?
as you said, you've had difficulties. what would you say was the low of this...
discouragement.
well, when you felt the worst about what was going on, losing and...
well, that period you went through with an awful lot of losses, and i wonder when you felt the worst.
james lost last night. do you think there's any olympic effect on players, or will be on some of them - maybe not you - but other players?
what's been the greatest comeback in your career? and the opposite, the worst-blown lead in your career?
you spoke in the press conference the other day about some of the struggles you were having late in the summer about maybe not playing well, but today you seemed to go out and have a very, very strong showing. do you feel that you're sort of back in form right now? are you happy with the way you're playing?
i know that it's hard to look ahead. generally you like to think one match at a time, but you've been able to get to semifinals here the last two years. right now, do you think you have the game and the fitness to take it to that next step and reach the final?
you have played well here in the past. is there something about this tournament that you think brings out your best tennis?
when you play somebody like dmitry who you played davis cup with before, do you have to do something different mentally knowing that this is a davis cup teammate? i don't know if you guys are friends or not, but is it a little bit different playing somebody like dmitry than somebody you don't have that relationship with?
how does it feel to get to the second week of a grand slam?
seriously, what does that mean to you? we have serena, venus, andy is through, james and mardy will be through. they're 1 and 2.
as one of the young guys coming up, there's so much pressure or expectations on who's going to be the next great american player. people have talked about you, donald young. i just wonder, has that affected you at all? you try to live up to what other people want of you?
what do you want for yourself?
so you've seen karlovic before. talk about some of the keys today. there's going to be a lot of moments when you're just to be walking sideline to sideline after the bombs came. seemed like you played the bigger points better than he has.
sweet backhand lob at a crunch time in the first set tiebreak. did you feel like fabrice santoro out there or something?
you're only 5'6". do you feel a little bit like a david going out to goliath when you're facing a 6'10" guy?
there's a chance you play nadal next round. you played in '06.
could you talk about that possibility, what you might remember from that match?
how have you gotten better since then, and even during this season?
just to follow up in terms of mentally in your approach within the match.
can you take us through your prematch routine?
was there anything you had to cut out that you were doing that you stopped doing that you learned?
do you think this is a breakout tournament for you?
you seem to be closing out your matches really effectively. like today, you know, pretty much no problem on your serves. very tough to do. what are you focusing on in those final games?
how much of the roddick match did you see last night, if any?
success of another american like andy sort of spur you on or the other american players?
how's your body feeling, because i think last time you had some cramping issues?
how encouraging was it for you to get through it today without that stuff to move forward?
you've seen nadal play. you've seen him play obviously many times. the strategy going out there, do you see something in his game you can exploit, or are you going to say, i've gotta grip and rip, and that's pretty much...
media-wise, you of course, won the tennis channel open, and you talked about getting espn time today, cbs. what's next, you thinking cnn?
it did. you got some good air time. you were on. at 11:00 when venus was not yet on, you were on.
did you get your cellphone back?
i heard john madden say on the radio when he did the same thing that's the most destructive way that cellphones are damaged, dropping them in the toilet.
what gives you more confidence: winning in vegas or a tournament where you go to the quarterfinals and beat some real heavy hitters?
on a clay court tournament, growing up in the la area, not really playing clay, that must really encourage you?
who did you grow up rooting for? is there a particular player?
why?
everybody's always talking about what's the best path through childhood for tennis. how do you assess your tennis childhood?
which club was that?
sounds normal.
how close were you to going to college? were you in between turning pro and going to, i think, sc?
what pushed over to pro instead of college?
can you give us your thoughts on this match?
is this the first time you've gone five sets?
the other time was davis cup?
how did you get through? how did you get through this fifth set? what did you keep telling yourself?
if someone told you before the tournament that you would go this far and beat the no.4 in the world, would you have believed it before the tournament?
do you know how big it is in japan? do you have any feedback?
is it huge?
you said on tv this was your biggest win ever. you won a tournament in delray beach earlier this year. do you think that helped you tonight by winning a tournament this year, your confidence?
at one point you pulled out a book with a british flag on the cover and it had some english writing inside it. what were you reading?
are those like little key words or reminders that you have to keep telling yourself during the match?
what was one of them?
when did your legs start cramping up? during the third set?
did you start feeling a little bit off your service then, with the leg cramps?
looked like about ten miles came off in the third set and another ten after in the fourth set.
do you think it's just because you're not used to the fifth set? i know you said you did one before, but you're not used to the five-set match?
the crowd, at least in the beginning of the match and until the third set, was more partisan to you. did that egg you on at least, push you along, hearing your name being chanted on louis armstrong?
also on that first match point you had, back i believe it was the fifth set, not the last game, but the first match point, some guy yelled out. did that unnerve you at all?
you threw the ball up and had to re-serve.
are you in pain now? you looked a little uncomfortable when you walked in.
have you ever been that physically spent after a match?
is it just fatigue, or do you have any serious problems that could affect your next match? do you think you will be okay?
can you talk a little bit about how you came to the united states from japan five years ago? you were so young. what were some of the big adjustments you had to make to the north american culture?
did your family come with you, or did you come alone?
i believe you have achieved something that no male player in your country has done since 1995, so almost as long as you've been alive. what does that mean to you?
you sort of made a little bit of history back home with what you've done.
what does that mean to you to sort of do that, to be a pioneer of sorts?
from where i was sitting, ai sugiyama was watching and applauding and enjoying it very much. did she reach out to you yet? did you talk to her?
you were advised by shuzo matsuoka? you have contact with them?
gives you a little bit of some help in adjusting to the tour or...
what he said? you can share?
just real quick, what's the last book you read and the kind of car you drive?
what do you know about sam querrey? you played him two years ago in cincinnati.
can you talk about the passing shot that got you to the break in the second set? do you really feel the momentum shifted at that point to your side?
the second set the passing shot.
are you more comfortable here on this court now than you have been before?
what did change with you receiving his serve? i mean, you broke him. he was serving well initially. i think you broke him six of his last eight?
switching from night matches to day matches back and forth, is that any problem? is there a change in your game or change in the background, looking at the opponent?
what are you going to do in new york on a saturday night? going to catch the blake/fish match, enjoy yourself in manhattan?
any predictions for the blake/fish match tonight?
how far are you from your best level, especially in terms of intensity?
you've had the fans really cheering you this year on your very excellent year. what's it going to be like to be playing against an underdog who's a hometown favorite? does that actually help you when they're not cheering for you, or do you even notice?
how did you get back in the match? did you think you were out of it at two sets to love down?
is it one of those things where when you've done the fitness and had the experience of coming from two sets down before you realize it's possible and that gives you more confidence?
andy ram?
did you feel good at the start or were you just surprised by the way he came at you?
can you talk about the point in the third set where you broke his serve and then you came back and served five consecutive points to win the next game. was that a turning point for you?
yeah.
no, you won.
he was.
no, no, no he had 15. that's right, but you got the game back on your serve after you broke his serve. so that made it 4-2.
have you hit bigger than 138?
were you more pleased with your serving percentage today?
at the end, flexed your muscles like popeye. is it spinach? is it more lifting or in that moment for you is it just a lot of relief?
any spinach or organic materials?
the fitness issues come into play more when you start thinking at whatever age you started thinking that you had a chance to be a grand slam player?
how do you compare that to the gasquet victory?
in three weeks you're going to see that guy again in wimbledon. can you give a little preview of that match?
he was struggling physically at the end, the last set. how were you feeling?
were you very much aware that you had the advantage then because of the fact that you felt good and you could see that he...
do you think it's a fair rule that a player can get a massage because he's tired rather than an injury and keep you waiting?
do you understand why there is no hawk-eye at the richest tournament on earth, in the third biggest court?
you're into the second week now. how do you look at your situation now and prospects?
going to the next round, when would you allow yourself to kind of smile and say, hey, i've achieved something in this tournament as opposed to now?
so how was today's match and how was nishikori?
how is your condition?
you won a terrific five-setter against nadal - i might be mistaken - last year.
but nevertheless, do you relish a night match that really is a slugfest in the end, a very difficult match both ways, that lasts a long time?
in the first two sets it looked like you were having some trouble returning his serve. was it just too hard for you? was it just hard to see?
did he surprise you in the first couple sets, like how high of a level he was playing?
he called the doctor, trainer. how did you think about it?
do you think you should have maybe called the trainer yourself?
which shot made you difficult to play from kei?
looked like you were getting a little unnerved out there and banging the racquet. did it hurt you at all when you were getting upset? do you feel like you were a little bit frustrated?
are you impressed with nishikori? he's only 18 but he plays with a lot of poise, like he's 25 or something.
in the first set tiebreaker, you saved those set points. then you have yours. after that set got away, how much of a toll did that take?
are you leaving here pleased with your second round appearance or disappointed with second round loss?
what specifically is wrong with your knee and after that, what about during, say, the first set particularly was so tight and you had set points, did you think back at all to the nadal match at wimbledon?
did you at all feel like, well, you know, maybe you haven't been in that match with nadal, that maybe this was the time, you know, for you to break through and that was a match that you learned from?
it's a bit of a rough day for some of the american men out there today.
do you pay attention to that much at all, other americans, robby because you guys are pals?
novak says he only made 13 unforced errors in three sets. that's pretty startling. are you aware of that? does that frustrate you that? does that get in your head he's not making a ton of mistakes?
how impressed are you with his game and how good a player is he and can he be?
how would you compare his speed versus nadal?
i'm wondering, roger said at the end of the match that he was surprised at how freewheeling you were. is it easier to play a guy like roger who you've got nothing to lose, you might as well just go for it?
there's no pressure when you're playing a guy like that?
you said during the off-season you missed 20 days of practice because of your illness. can you put into perspective what that 20 days means? is that something that you can make up, or does that affect your preparation for the entire year?
you missed a few volleys today, and i just wonder, are we looking at things because of your year that when you miss a volley, saying, oh, look he's doing that and he you didn't do it last year and it was not that big a deal?
i read that tennis players get a smaller percentage of overall revenue than basketball players, baseball player, et cetera, other athletes in other fields. i was curious what your thoughts are on that.
will this lead to more unionization, perhaps, a place to organize? make sure you get an equitable part of the pie?
the two matches you've had this week have been some of your more comfortable wins over the summer. winning the gold medal in beijing in the doubles, even though it's a different discipline, is that confidence you've been able to take into your singles game moving forward?
is there a good feeling about this court, sort of home sweet home where you've done so well helping your spirits?
you've been sort of on and off with different coaches. where are you now with that?
have you been following nadal's matches? like did you watch him last night on tv, or...
why don't you just zero in...
you played obviously the late match, and then you played a relatively early one. there's a lot of discussion, because this is the only tournament with night matches whether people more comfortable day or night. does it matter to you?
i don't want to ask you if you like hawk-eye or not. it's been here for a while. how do you think it affects matches the way it's sort of evolved?
is it fair that they have a system not for all courts?
since having mono, has there been a residual effect where the normal fatigue that before you would have considered just a normal part of your season you pay more attention to, or, you know, how do you differentiate between just normal fatigue and maybe fatigue that could be signaling a recurrence?
he really went for his shots. what surprised you about him?
in the last weeks, maybe since the olympic games, you have a relation with an athlete from paraguay; is that true?
what's been the greatest comeback in a match you've had in your career and worst blown lead?
of all the matches you played, what's been your greatest comeback in a match, and the opposite, your worst blown lead?
and the opposite? your worst blown lead? where you had a lead, control of the match, and you lost it?
you were moving pretty well today, but i have to ask you, how does your ankle feel? is that pretty much done with? are you okay?
just talking about the media paying attention to your life a little bit. since you kind of became one of the top three, one of the top ranked players in the world last couple of years, how much do you pay attention to the media reports?
i think this is your biggest success right now, first grand slam, third round.
how would you describe it? is it fantastic for you?
do you know why he has retired?
could you tell us a little bit yourself? you practiced at the bollettieri academy. why did you choose that academy?
but you could choose, also, another one. why did you choose bollettieri?
how old have you been when you went...
okay. and how is the contact with mr. bollettieri at the moment, for example?
contact with him. i mean, do you speak with him after such a big victory, for example?
what does he say?
did you get any sort of sense of why he retired? did he seem to have an injury, or do you know what was in his mind?
can you just talk about your match today, how you played.
how much time do you spend in japan in a year, for example? are you just staying in the states, or are you sometimes in japan?
and just for a week or...
and your parents, they still live in japan?
how hard was it for you when, 13 years, left your parents, left japan to go to the states. was it a big step for you?
other players from japan went with you to the states?
where are they now? are they still...
japan?
so you're the only one that stayed?
if there had been a challenge system on that call, could you have proven the world record?
tricky match for you?
is it hard because there are not many players who attack the net as much as he does, chips and charges on second serves so much?
did you come out of that thinking that's a job well done, or do you come out that thinking you're going t have to raise your levels?
what do you think about your next opponent, melzer? you played him once this year.
when you're playing a guy who is serving very well and you're not making much headway, how easy is it to get frustrated, and how pleased are you with the job you did kind of not losing it when you weren't getting anywhere on his serve?
he was also quite upset about the line calling, as well. would you take that any further or...
there are times when you vented your frustration verbally. in past years, could that have got further? are you better now at just dealing with it, getting rid of it, and moving on and getting the win?
did you hear the guy heckling you?
yeah.
something about you and the queen, i think.
is it a bit unfair that the grandstand, which is, you know, a major court here, doesn't have hawk-eye?
how easy is it to kind of stay in the present? i know you say you have to take it one match at a time, but is that, in practice, that easy, or do you try to avoid looking too far ahead into next week?
when i last saw you after you lost here last year, it seems like you've become a different guy. you beat federer and you played some great tennis here. in fact, you didn't go to beijing. do you see that now as this is your prime opportunity? do you see this as the year of the fish fanatics?
could you talk about playing james in the next round. he says he's in your wedding, groomsman, not best man; is that correct?
is it hard to do?
where is the wedding and are there any other tennis players or athletes as your groomsmen in your wedding party?
this is a big hurdle for you to overcome. you've had opportunities second round, especially last year and today, playing a real good player. doesn't seem like big nerves on the big points.
do you think there will be a little side bet with james, dinner or something?
can you talk about a little bit about this class, this american group you're part of with andy and james and robby, and, you know, patrick mcenroe as your davis cup coach.
how old would you have been when you went to saddlebrook?
do you like flying under the radar screen? you did beat federer at indian wells. you're playing fine tennis. is that part of the strategy?
law of averages is on your side here, then.
this is the first time in a few years that someone not named roddick or blake is not going to make it the second week. you and sam and robby and some other guys.
let 's get down to basics here. you go through life with a pretty unique name. what's the best part of having the last name you have, and what's the worst part?
can you give us a best and worst or couple of your favorites?
do you feel self-conscious when you go out and order the fish and...
mardy, how did you feel about james and the olympics with gonzlez and gonzlez not owning up to supposedly hitting that?
fernando said that after three hours in a tough match like that you don't feel your body. what are your thoughts about that?
why is tennis held to a higher standard than baseball?
different.
are you quite pleased with the way that you played today?
are you happy, content with the way you played?
can you describe how you felt out there today?
i think he's the last person that you played, is he not?
so kind of coincidental. but how do you feel health-wise after the surgery? do you feel anything from the surgery? you feel healthy? feel strong?
did you have any question in your own mind about maybe should you play here best of five, hardcourts?
you thought you were going to do well?
has this been sort of an agonizing year? tremendous australian open and then not much since.
has this been a agonizing or very difficult year for you? we watched such a marvelous australian open, and then nothing much since then.
your health is perfect?
some players experience depression when they're away from the tour, especially with injury and a few weeks goes by they're not on the tour. they're wondering what's going to happen in the future. did you have any difficult periods during your layoff?
some players experience depression when they're away from the sport, especially with an injury. seems like the world is moving and they're staying in one place. mentally, some players struggle with this. did you have any problems like that?
you said you had a little bit of fear or anxiety about your knee, but obviously now it seems like it's fine. at what point during the match did you feel like it was back or that...
no?
for those of us who weren't familiar with the accident, your knee, was it a one-moment thing or was it a slow...
ligament?
meniscus?
in casablanca your last match was a walkover with simon, i believe. was that because of your knee injury?
to look at your record, you would make an appearance here, you went down to indian wells, you went down to florida. you were trying to play, but it just got to be too much. was that it?
how was your play against monfils? have you played monfils again?
how is your ankle?
happy with the match, the way things went out there today?
you captured the hearts of so many fans out there. you were such a fan favorite, and, you know, to be back here, be back out on stadium court, has it sort of become a place that you've come to love, kind of considering last year's experiences?
how much different of a person and a player are you as you arrived here this year as opposed to how you felt about yourself and your game when you arrived here last year, having reached that final and winning a grand slam?
over this last year, you've had so many more people pay attention to what you're doing and follow you closer. even when you hurt your ankle today, there was quiet in the crowd. do you enjoy the increased attention? i mean, how do you approach that?
well, i mean, to follow up, what's the best part of it and maybe what's, you know, maybe not so good about it, from your experience?
today jelena was on the court almost an hour more than you were. were you surprised that, you know, that match went as long as it did? and how does that affect when you're just in the locker room not knowing whether you should eat something or what was that like?
back to the olympics, you showed big emotion when you lost to nadal in the semifinal, which is quite different compared to other occasions you played with him. why is that?
last year you came in after that, the great tournament in montreal, i think, made you somebody recognizable to a lot of the american tennis fans who maybe didn't know that much about you prior to that. and you came in obviously on a high because of that, and you were, you know, you showed a lot of your own personality, the impersonations and the entertainment on court and so forth. this year you come in as a grand slam winner, a finalist here last year, as well, somebody who made a great run at the olympics. how different is it? it's only one year separated, and yet it's quite a different gateway into this tournament than it was a year ago, isn't it?
what are your thoughts on many, many, many tennis people saying they'd love to see a rematch of the wimbledon final, those other two guys?
you said you don't want to be remembered as a clown. is that something in that you try and keep in check? maybe last year it was all fun, there was some fun and games and so forth. maybe this year, have you actually put some walls around yourself and said, look, this is serious business, you know, i can't be quite as...
now that you've won one major, novak, do you find yourself being impatient to win a second one, too?
how did you play? how do you feel you played today?
at the olympics, you said you were tired and you seemed to have trouble with motivation. do you still feel that way?
has the whole argello business, do you think that's behind you, or do you think that's always going to be over your head in any major tournament?
well, the whole controversy over what happened, about a year ago and the match with argello in poland. even though you're been cleared, is that a burden you're going to carry with you, rightly or wrongly?
do you think it was unfair that you got tarnished with that scandal that you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time?
what is the status of that investigation as far as you know? i mean, it's still ongoing?
and you believe it's still not finished?
do you believe it will be finished this year?
there's been a lot of conversations in the press room in the last few days with players such as andy murray and james blake, for instance, saying that there's a different feeling this year on the men's side, in that in the past few years roger seemed unbeatable. roger is the player that knocked you out in the last two years in the semis. do you now look at things a little bit differently since maybe roger isn't as dominant as he was in the past several years?
would you say it's a reasonable assessment - i think it was james said it himself - he said i believe solidly, firmly, that there are six or seven players here who have a realistic shot at winning this tournament. would you agree with that assessment, and would you put yourself in that group?
i'd like to ask you about the semifinal match against argentina, davis cup. i'd like to know your opinion.
are you afraid or worried about the crowd, the people?
do you see too much difference between the match of 2003? do you expect a much better result?
if you were to win this tournament, is it a double-edged sword? because along with the glory and the money will come more scrutiny and more pressure about what did happen in poland.
the women's golf tournament is trying to push through a rule, make a rule that says players must learn english within two years of being on tour to speak to the media, speak to the sponsors. what do you think of such a rule?
do you think tennis players get enough of the revenue, enough prize money, considering all of the revenue that the united states tennis association receives? there was an article in a sports business journal that tennis players don't get as good a share of the revenue as, say, football or basketball players get.
how did it go from your point of view?
who is your coach now?
who's here with you now?
did you learn something about the rules today that you didn't know before? because a lot of people seemed to think that you haven't foot faulted, but apparently the rules say you did.
do you think the official wanted to insert himself and impose?
have you had problems with that before?
just to clarify, i mean, you're in the middle of a grand slam here. you have better things to do than fight this battle. do you talk to people? i mean, what's the procedure when you have a situation like this?
on a happier note, were you pleased with how you came back in the fifth and put it behind?
have you received this courtesy in the past? have other officials warned you and said you, all right, thanks. i'll look out for it? is this the first time someone has called it without giving you a warning ?
but you'd like to?
do you think the call itself should be changed?
i was just going to ask you what did the chair umpire say to you for explanation?
did you actually ask the linesman? did you get a chance to ask him yourself how he saw the call, or did you just talk to the umpire?
did you ever get a chance to go up to him and talk to him, the linesman himself?
when the call was made in cincinnati, was it also by the same...
same area of the court? was it more of an area where...
you've talked in the past year about situations where you've let your temper tear your game apart and not been able to regroup. the fact that you were able to regroup, you know, you were obviously quite upset, come back in that fifth set and regroup and take it, i mean, can you take something positive out of this?
your sister was in here earlier after her win, and she talked about you actually have talked to her through the years about trying to learn from your...
can you just give us a couple minutes what you think of what she's done professionally so far this year in particular and maybe what her chances are?
as a brother, how proud of her are you?
were you surprised that the referee called security to the court?
so many matches, so many men's matches, seem to be fighting for just one serve and a break. in this match you started off with two quick breaks. did that throw you off in any way? is that a different sort of mentality starting the match?
what did you sense on the other side of the net? was there any sign of an injury or anything like that?
just played well?
can you put this win in perspective, how big it is in your own mind in terms of your own development?
are you still working with gil?
so you go to him?
as opposed to him coming to you?
is that work of benefit during the season, or do you see that mostly as an off-season deal or when you have longer breaks?
what's so special about gil reyes?
you take a pretty relaxed attitude to your career. you weren't pushing it, you weren't rushing it, setting goals or anything. what's it been like for you in the past year? are there times when you sort of look at the rankings and say, i should be doing better, or i'm doing better than i thought?
do you have a favorite story you could share with us about something special, something from the olympics? it must have been quite an experience to go there.
did anyone think you were a basketball player because of your height?
and your favorites athlete that you met there?
have you played a guy who plays somewhat similar to you? a lot of power? big serve and stuff? do you like playing a guy like that?
did somebody ask you to compare it to koubek last year?
seems like you met a guy berdych, who's improved his whole career until this year. he's sliding back. meantime, you seem to be pushing up. you're higher in the points race, ranking. you're kind of crossing paths very similar to you in a way.
seems like all this talk about american tennis there's an urgency, you know. i hear about people in the game wanting to see an american ascend to a certain level. how much is a player of your age and where you are in your career, how much do you feel that urgency?
do you feel like you've learned a lot this year so far?
did you see any of donald's match with james last night?
did you expect it to take this long for him to sort of come of age and play a match like that against a top player?
is it safe to assume you've seen your draw for the next few rounds?
that being the case, is it hard not to sort of play this what-if game and look at points and prize money and just sort of spin us out a few rounds?
is this one of the best matches you've ever played today?
what are the other two?
gasquet?
what's been the greatest moment of your career and the most painful moment so far?
i think there was a point at the beginning of the third set that there was a little dispute about, and you basically told your opponent that the ball was in and not out. could you talk about that?
can you just talk about the reason you called the trainer specifically?
how big a win was this in your mind?
you had some friends or your coach maybe at the south end, kind of the south baseline in the stands. you turned around at one point you were talking to them i think right after the second set. was that your coach or friends?
how long have you been living at bollettieri's?
almost five years?
are you liking it?
and do you miss japan at all?
can you talk about the olympic experience at all?
was that a first round match at the olympics?
how often do you go back home?
and do you communicate? are your parents here, or are they...
and how do you communicate normally? telephone or text message or computer?
have you made many friends at the academy?
who are some of your buddies there?
do you think it would be possible for you to develop your game if you weren't in that environment? do you need to be there, or is it a choice?
could you develop your game this well in japan, do think, or not?
do you know shuozo?
have you spoken with him?
does he give you advice or some words of wisdom?
do you remember him playing, seeing pictures of him playing?
how recognizable of an athlete are you in japan like when you walk down the street? are you pretty much known?
when did you start to cramp in the match?
3-2, fourth set?
and you retired at wimbledon. was that because of cramping, also?
stomach muscle?
you mentioned shuozo. were you familiar with him cramping here and how that became a very famous...
did you think about that when you started cramping today?
why the best japanese tennis player doesn't play with a yonex racquet?
yeah.
you had a great fall last year. some players, i'm wondering if you think they play better in the beginning of the year or end of the year?
just players in general. are they better at spacing out how they play over the entire year or do you think...
some players, they win more titles in the first half and some in the second half. do you think of certain players as being good starters and others as good finishers?
you didn't feel that way last fall?
i guess there was a little bit of a scare out there today in round 1. i guess all the talk about facing federer, you have to worry about the mardy fishes and the robby ginepris of the world before you worry about a championship?
do you think he played much better than his normal level today against you?
how difficult is it to make the change from beijing and going through that tournament, doing all this flying, and starting with a few days' rest? is that difficult?
do you think you're more worn out physically, emotionally, or mentally?
yes.
elena dementieva said earlier today that she was having a bit of hard time shifting focus from gold medal victory in beijing and now to come here. she said it's just been a difficult shift of focus.
are you concerned a little bit about how long it took to play this match as far as continuing on, especially because, as you say, there is a little bit of being tired involved because of the travel?
why do you think you haven't had great success here? is it the court? is it the atmosphere? why haven't you had a good...
are you feeling more comfortable on the hardcourts?
for the last three years you've been chasing no.1, and that's always been a big motivation in front of you to do well in tournaments. this is your first grand slam as the no.1. does that change the way you feel playing, the way that you're motivated towards your setting goals?
do you feel the balls are playing the same this year as they were last year? i understand they're playing a little bit heavier.
thoughts on that, andy?
did you step up, or did he just kind of go off the ball a little bit?
did you enjoy the last point?
is there a mindset when you play in the first round. i'm just watching the match with nadal and he had a little scare. is there kind of a pressure on the prohibitive favorite against the underdog? nobody wants to be embarrassed in round one. i'm curious what goes through your mind when you step out on court?
did it hurt when the ball hit you?
you didn't take it personally?
it's important, andy, just to sort of get back to winning ways and somewhat back to the way you -- i know it wasn't as challenging as cincinnati, but just to kind get back on the winning road?
you're one of several who have taken a victory over roger this year. in the past several years there's been a feeling he's almost unbeatable, and that's come out in many, many, many press conferences. the last few days we had a chance to talk to james blake and andy himself, and many others, and they described maybe a little bit of a different atmosphere this year, maybe a sense that, you know, that any number of players could take this championship. do you feel a little different this year in that respect?
james said he felt roger really hadn't lost anything. he just feels that tennis has just progressed and players have progressed and gotten better. would you agree with that assessment?
would it be correct to sort of view you this year or in your own mindset as previously you believed you could win a slam like this. now you know you're equipped to win a slam like this?
can you talk about your olympic experience. not so much on the court but the atmosphere and what it was like to compete in the games.
i know you are a fight fan, did you get to see any of the boxing competition?
there's a contrast between no cars and no planes and new york, what is it about playing here that you really enjoy and what is it you feed off?
i don't know if it's gabashvili or llodra at this point, but could you just talk about both of those players and have you had much experience with gabashvili?
anne won today. very rare to have two brits in a slam.
will you be taking some pictures at the end? can you tell us what that was about?
tim henman used to say he felt the weight of the whole nation on his shoulders. do you feel that way or is it andy murray playing for andy murray?
was there a moment where you became aware of this, you were now at "no excuses, no worries" period? what have you done? when did you first feel like that?
how important is winning this tournament? is it going to be the kind of case where you worry about being the carlos moya of this century: a good player but doesn't win the championship? is that a concern?
last year you had great success here obviously. can you draw upon that success to, you know, help you gain confidence, you know, this year?
the four grand slam events are all very, very distinctive, different, different challenges, different atmospheres.
i know you've had some difficulty on the hardcourts this summer. is this something you're working on right now? if you could just describe sort of how you're playing and your sense of confidence coming in.
you're really one of the great returners in the game today. what's the secret to being a great returner?
could you start out by describing what this means to you to win a masters title?
after the second set tiebreak, the 4-4 point that went on forever, you both looked exhausted. how exhausting was it out there?
when you had the four match points and they get away from you, what's going through your mind at that point?
did you feel like this was your week with how you played from the beginning of the tournament, that things were really coming together?
you won four consecutive sets off the no.3 player in the world, including three tiebreaks. what do you think the key to that success has been?
what happened with against him last week, did you take any that was from toronto to here?
you said yesterday that you're happier and calmer on court now.
do you know why you're feeling that way?
the first major tournament and i guess you're going to be no.6 tomorrow. going into the olympics and the us open, do you feel like this your time to kind of break out and break into the top 5 and really compete for slams?
do you think the return was the biggest difference between you two today? you seemed to read his serve really well today.
obviously there was a lot of the buzz this week about the changing of the no.1. do you feel like you kind of broke out a little bit with this win?
do you think you'll have fond memories of this tournament and cincinnati just because it's where you won your first big event?
you seemed to have the knack of getting his serve back better than most people.
is it harder to receive that serve in these quick conditions?
does the height that it comes from have any impact in the whole thing? does it feel different because of that?
you're bound to go up to your highest ranking of 6.
do you take pleasure in that, or is it a little too far ahead of the us open to do so?
to reach your first masters series final, what does that mean to you?
how is your energy level playing a lot matches last week and this week as well?
you appeared to move pretty well on the court today. did you feel a little more energy than yesterday?
how is your knee feeling?
very good performances. in three of the four matches though you've gone behind at the start. is it something that's worth analysis or just something that happens?
were you surprised that the lob was so successful?
did you watch him play federer? and if so, did you develop a view of federer and what his state is?
back to the return for a second. i notice that you start pretty far back and come forward before you split. is there thinking behind that, or is it just natural?
did you figure out the prize you're going to give roger if he ask you for advise how to beat ivo on this cort in cincinnati if you play next year?
you turned it around pretty dramatically in the third game of the second set. talk through what changed for you.
what thoughts were going through your mind at 2-0?
how is the heat for you today? was it worse today, or did to get better when the clouds came?
did you think it had almost gone?
you played fantastically well, but were you okay physically in that first phase of the match?
at one point you grabbed your knee after the point. was it bothering you any more today than it has been?
there is a lot of buzz about the no.1 position changing hands. it's really exciting for fans. is it exciting for you guys as players?
seeing someone else finally achieve it, does it give you more ambition -- i assume you have ambition to be no.1 -- does that do anything for your own ambition?
do you feel maybe a little bit more poised for a masters breakthrough this particular week?
for you, how much would it mean to get to the final?
few years ago i watched you win a challenger at seascape, and everybody noted your confidence. it seems like that's increased, particularly maybe in the last year. can you talk just a little bit about where that comes from?
yeah.
has miles gone home?
is there any special reason for that?
is that a pity in a way? i mean, it's a quite an important match tomorrow.
regarding your confidence, what do you think now that making consecutive semifinals in masters series will do for your expectations?
what pleased you most about what you did when you were making that comeback?
you been doing very well in tiebreakers. does that give you confidence when you get into these situations?
how important it was to follow up from yesterday's win today after beating roger?
you had a great year last year. i think this is going to be your first masters series semifinal.
so you're excited about that as well, i guess.
how big of an opportunity is this for you? do you feel like you can win this tournament?
after wimbledon or at wimbledon, you lost there then lost two other first rounders. what's the turnaround?
how about andy tomorrow? you've played twice before, two very close matches.
when you get into tiebreakers now, how much confidence do you have?
i'm from television switzerland and i didn't have a chance to talk to you yesterday. i would like to ask a question about the match yesterday. what was different or how roger played you differently than the last six matches you played against him?
did you approach the match differently since you know that he was struggling lately?
if you were to go on to win this tournament, how much would that mean to you?
what was the story of the match?
i was there.
i was curious what you thought the story was.
if you play nadal tomorrow, does it make a difference if you face him on a hard court or a clay court or a grass court?
what do you think is the biggest difference surface to surface against him?
is it surprising, because he's never really done well here, he wins toronto...
but is it surprising that he's done so well on hard courts?
does it matter to you who is no.1? the whole story has captivated the fan's attention.
do you kind of feel like maybe you're the forgotten man? so much focus on no.1 and 2, but you're still no.3.
is it true that you and gulbis played in the juniors a lot against each other?
you never played him in the juniors?
you went to the same academy in germany?
i think people are curious to get to know him a little bit better. do you have any stories or can you share anything from your days at the academy?
was there anything about your performance tonight that made you unhappy?
looked like your breakpoint conversion went down a little bit. was that something of a concern, or not?
roger lost today, which opens the way for you to finally move ahead of him in the rankings. will that be in the back of your mind the rest of the week?
so what's that like for you to finally be there?
how does your uncle toni influence you both on and off the court?
is the running forehand a shot that you've been working on? you've had a great forehand, but, i mean, the running aspect of it, is that a new shot that you kind of added to your game?
what part of your game is better now than it was a year ago?
what do you think of the crowds here in cincinnati and the fans?
can you talk about the difficulty in winning two hard court masters series compared to winning the us open? you know, if you win here it's ten matches in two weeks versus seven at the us open in the same amount of time.
than a grand slam.
and no days off between your matches.
pretty straightforward match?
how would you compare the heatness (sic) to, say, australia or somewhere?
you've beaten carlos in your only match. it was hard court not so long ago. pretty confident?
sorry.
how are you feeling? because hard courts are really tough on the body? how is your knee doing?
do you know exactly what it is?
is that both knees or just one?
which one?
not the one you use on with your serve.
how tough is it to have a nine-month season on the hard court, supposedly the toughest for the body?
so the 24 hours between the two matches at the end of the tournament are really very important for recuperation.
i didn't hear what you had to say at the beginning, but was heat an issue in this match, or might it have become one?
did you get plenty of sort of signs and body language that he was starting to get discouraged?
are you please with the way your serve is coming on?
you had some smartly-played dropshots in your match. can you discuss your strategy using that stroke and what you thought about that?
it's a bit risky, but you made it work.
do you have a trick to stay cool during the match?
how do you compare this victory to, let's say 2003 when you knocked out hewitt in the first round, defending champion there?
in the last six matches that you've played against him, you won exactly two sets. they were all close. what did you do differently today that you didn't do in the past that may have helped you pull through?
did you believe in yourself more because of federer's recent performance? did you think you had a better chance because of the way he's playing?
why? how come? why this time you felt like you believed in yourself more?
was it different playing him today because he's been struggling lately? is it is different federer out there from your perspective on the other side of the net?
so he's still the no.1 guy in the world as far as you could tell the way he played and kind of was out there?
why did you challenge the last point, i think it was the last point, or close to the last. at the end of the last tiebreak you had a first serve that was close and you had four challenges at that point.
you felt sure it was out?
you challenged it, so i don't know. i didn't see it on tv.
what do you do next round to avoid a letdown coming off a win against roger in your match against kohlschreiber?
you had 21 aces today versus 6 for federer. did you see any weakness in his return game that you focused perhaps more on your serve than you did in previous matches?
you played nine previous tiebreakers with roger. he won eight of them. what was the difference today? just a lot law of averages catching up, or something different?
does beating him at the french give you more confidence coming into today?
if djokovic advances, having played him tough at the french, do you feel good about your chances against him?
you mentioned that you lost your concentration in the second set. how much does that happen for you?
do you think that's just because you're a young player and eventually it'll go away?
where would you rank this win among your career wins?
did you think you would be in a masters series quarterfinal this soon in your career?
many people say that you will be in top 10. how much longer do you think you'll be in there, and is top 10 enough for you?
is there any pressure on you to get there as faster as some players got, like nadal and djokovic?
in the match against clement your backhand didn't work good and there were many unforced errors from that side. today was completely different story. did you practice this shot before the match?
given your history with novak, does that make it easy or harder to play him?
you talked a little bit about latvia earlier this week. how popular do you think your success is making tennis in latvia?
i wondered if it means a lot to you that a player like yourself beat the last american in this tournament. the united states has always invested a lot in tennis, and as you said, latvia hasn't invested much.
will you call or text many people to tell them what you did today?
your mom will be happy, huh?
what was the injury before toronto?
what does your coach think about you playing football?
do you play a lot of other sports, basketball hockey, anything like that?
basketball is big in latvia?
did you play basketball growing up?
you weren't broken in this match. how...
what do you think the difference was in the match? seemed to be determined on a couple of points.
did you find anything in these last two matches that gives you a positive feeling going ahead?
how discouraging is it for you that another masters series event goes by without you winning it?
have you already thought about how you're going regroup?
will you follow the rest of the tournament and see how rafa does?
in the tiebreak sets were you attacking his backhand a little bit more? it looked like in the tiebreak he maybe changed his tactics a little bit as opposed to the regular sets.
he.
to what extent would you hope that nadal doesn't win this tournament?
how tough is that serve compared to the other big servers? do you think the height is a factor?
were you happy your preparation coming into this week?
were you happy with it?
at what point do you start losing confidence in yourself and your game? and will that ever happen?
last match you mentioned that the courts here are quicker that toronto. was that a factor at all? does it take you that long to adjust from maybe a slower to a faster court?
what do you think was the difference in the match today? you blew him away in the second set, and the third set your first serve percentage went down a little bit. just curious what you think was the big difference.
for the first time in the long history of this tournament there are no americans in the quarters. do you look at this as just a coincidence, or is there something more to it?
how would you assess the gap between you and andy and mardy, sam, robby?
what do you think about a guy like gulbis? he's bee top 50, top 60 the last year or so, he did well at the french, and he's young. what do you think about his chances of maybe breaking into the top 30, top 40?
from what side he is more dangerous? in the match against clement he make many unforced errors on the backhand side. today he is become very good.
yeah. what side he is more dangerous on?
did you have a difficulty to reading his serve today?
i know you're disappointed now, but what positive do you take out of the match?
how hard is it to play a guy like that that drifts out of the match mentally and throws in the dropshots, changes...
does it hurt a little bit more after what happened in paris? were you looking for revenge?
how is the fitness report. maybe the knee, start with the knee.
you out-aced querrey, 11 to 7 or something. you must be fairly pleased with the win today.
did you also start to move well, or better, as the match went on?
where do you draw the line, this week especially, between doing well here and polishing up for the olympics but not going too far. i mean, if it comes down to something, playing maybe too much, too hard, risking injury, that kind of thing.
you got your tactics exactly right, too, didn't you, again?
were you pleased the way you got really completely on top after the tiebreak?
can you talk about your game, your place in the game right now specifically as it relates to nadal. you're 21, in the top 10, beaten roger a few times, but now nadal is there. i think he beaten you on all three surfaces this year. is it intimidating? what does he do so well?
tursunov has a very good record against gasquet. would you mind just giving sentence or two on each depending on you who you play.
will you force the wimbledon match out of your head if you have to play him again?
you went back out on the court to hit. the match was shorter than you anticipated. even after that three-setter you felt like you needed more work today to get ready for possibly nadal?
last time you played nadal was two years ago here, i think. have you been surprised at how much, how fast he's been improving since then?
you haven't played him in a couple years, but have you seen, watched, heard, how has he improved that much? what is he doing that much better than everyone else the last couple years?
on a day like today after a win like that, would you almost have rather have played the match? do you feel better getting the day of rest, or would you feel better having completed the match?
you going to watch any of that match tonight?
there's lots of talk about the no.1 position between federer and nadal. after the beginning of the year we thought you would be mixing up. where is your position right now?
yes, but are you looking...
and we are now back on hard courts. that's where you won, on the same surface you won the australian. is it that you're at the beginning of your favorite surface?
do you think you can use the talk with roger and raf this week and the no.1 ranking to your advantage in some way, kind of fly under the radar and take some pressure off?
given nadal's success, do you view them as almost co-no.1s right now? nadal could pass him soon. are they almost equal at that point?
what's your assessment of how you played today?
you talked about the serve in toronto. i think you saved 12 break points and you still managed to win the match, but how worried are you about the serve?
something technical, or what do you think?
you said in wimbledon after the loss to marat that mentally you felt a bit jaded. how do you feel now?
we heard roger talk about how important the olympics are to him. how would you rate the olympics in comparison to, say, a grand slam event?
quick work of the guy. anything in particular out there that you noticed?
how do you feel about where your hard court game is right now?
there's a lot of focus this week on the rankings at the top. what about yourself, how important is it for you to maintain that top 10 ranking at this point with all the points you have to defend here?
when did you get to town, and what have you been doing with your time, other than taking batting practice?
who is that?
how did you get to know david?
today the turning point came in the first set. he had a chance to take a double break lead but your fought it off.
i want to ask you about nadal. hard court is the one surface he hasn't won a major on. you played him at the us open in '05. what do you remember about that, and what have you seen improvement-wise in his game the last couple years?
you went through kind of a losing streak during the middle of the summer. how important is it to string together a win or two?
what are your expectations for regaining that crispness?
are you close at all with robby ginepri?
he was in the 170s i think in january and now he's kind of climbed his way back. seems like he's playing pretty well. you see anything behind that?
was that motivation lacking before? because he was top 20 and kind of fell off.
that was really close. what were your feelings as you were serving for the match?
do you feel it was a good performance?
almost a repeat of three years ago?
third set just kind of got away from you?
what specifically was wrong?
were you thinking that if you could just hold onto to the second set that the pain wouldn't be a problem? did you know it was going to be a problem if it went to three sets?
were you feeling the physical effects? i was just looking at your first serve percentage. you started 67, really good, and then the second set and the third kind of dropped down to like 48. was that because you were feeling anxiety or was that the physical thing?
did you detect any difference in roger's game? seems like people are getting a lot closer in terms of being able to beat hi, aside from nadal. you guys have played four previous times and you've been close each time. any difference you can point to?
does he seem more beatable than even three months ago?
obviously a tough loss. right now it will be tough for to you take positives out of it. but tomorrow, looking back on this you, you can take a little more positive than negative seeing as how you were serving for the match?
you talked about this a little bit yesterday how you're having more fun on the court even during practice. was it not fun? was it you were just pushing yourself to just get out there and practice, forcing yourself to do it?
was that not what happened last year, just not enough time on court?
did you know before you went on that he had a problem?
when could you tell?
his singles is improving, isn't it?
are you hitting the ball well on hard courts, do you think?
last year you had to retire because of a blister. how are the conditions then and now, and do they affect you?
you and guillaume have been working together for a bit now. how is the relationship going?
you made a lot of friends at wimbledon for the way in which you handled that very difficult defeat. we live in an era of gracious tennis players with roger federer and rafael nadal. can you talk a little about how you feel about sportsmanship in tennis? there have been some players who have been popular for being unsporting or behaving aggressively.
do you try to copy that sportsmanship, or do you have your own values?
if you win once more you may play andy murray again. but tursunov is a difficult opponent.
do you think to play him in is different way, or do know how you will play against him?
do you try to get in first in the rally?
the opening matches in tournaments can sometimes be the hardest, but if you survive then things change. do you think both of those things showed in this match?
did it make you feel about what happened three years ago when you played him?
talk about the conditions out there today. seemed like your unforced errors were a little bit higher than normal. was that true?
he said yesterday that he thought this time period right now would be the best time to play you. he was hoping to pull off an upset based on you coming here losing two straight matches. how much would you agree with that?
robby said that yesterday.
i guess he thought you would be pressing to hold onto the top ranking.
with so much of that talk lately with the ranking possibly switching, what is your take on being no.1? seems you're so nonchalant about some things in your game. is that one of the things that it's not all that important to you at this point?
your goal wasn't necessarily to stay at no.1, it's to...
how do you feel right now? are you happy and relieved a little bit that you finally have that win?
what was the key of the match today? first two sets were so closely contested. did you do anything different in the third set?
6-5 when he was serving for it, i noticed that you might have change the game plan a little bit. seemed as though you went a little bit more defensive. i don't know if consciously did that, but everything we saw other than breakpoint were slice backhands and you just allowed him to miss. did you think he was going to get tight in that situation, and did you consciously tell yourself that?
he broke and then you broke back, in the first set actually reversed there, but how do you stay cool? how do you not just lose it when you know you have an opportunity?
are you enjoying at all this challenge of trying to hold onto the top ranking when it's getting so close?
do you get the sense that the guys are playing you any differently now than they were maybe two, three years ago?
facing roger next. tell us about the match a little bit.
you must be hardened by the results. the last three times you've had really tight matches.
is there a good time to be playing him?
with jose kind of in the mix, is that going to add another dynamic to the match?
is he going to be watching?
how well do you feel about the way things have gone for you this season?
the stuff you mentioned, is there anything beyond that that you think has helped you not have the ups and downs?
people here still obviously remember you from the match when you beat nadal after he won canada. i was wondering what this place means to you? do you have any fond memories of cincinnati?
it's funny, because when you beat him that year i remember in your post-match press conference it didn't seem that big of a deal to you that you had beaten him.
how do you feel your summer so far?
the olympics are coming up. the buzz, are players feeling it?
the last olympic games, of course the match with roger. out of the olympics, do you take more out of the experience of four years ago, or is it beating roger that really stands out?
everybody now in the tennis world is talking about the fight for no.1. rafa could do it this week. is there a buzz in the locker room about that, or is it, for most of the players, just another week like you said?
how did lucie like your blog last week?
two match points missed. was it becoming a nightmare? were you really worried about it? did you think you could still fight till the end?
we all know what your emotions were when you lost last year. what are your emotions now on having won this championship?
losing the fourth set tiebreak the way you did, with two match points, could have been very depressing for other players. how did you emotionally deal with that fourth set so you could come out in the fifth and play your best tennis?
are you tired just a little bit?
was that the greatest match you ever played in?
is this a bigger achievement than winning the french open, as you said, due to the history of players from spain not doing so well here?
many spanish in the past said that grass is for cows. you have never said that.
what did you say to each other at the end? could you share with us?
in the fifth set, how close did you feel to actually losing it?
how did you handle the rain delays? roger is more experienced than you.
what did you do in the longer rain delay?
how concerned or worried were you that you weren't going to be allowed to finish because it was so dark?
yes.
you're the first person to climb into the royal box. how well do you know the prince?
what did he say to you?
you've beaten roger now on clay, on his grass. that only leaves hard court, doesn't it?
this year.
can you just try and express your feelings as the match went on and on and became tighter and more dramatic, what were some of the things that were going through your head?
did you say any thanks to the rains, the first delay? i think the rain helped you.
to find your game.
it's awfully soon afterwards, but how much can you appreciate what a fantastic match you were a part of?
was it too dark to play?
should it have had a better finish than that in near darkness?
of all the shots that you've hit in your career, where would you rate the backhand that kept you in the match down match point?
how would you describe what nadal did today?
what was your thinking on the very last shot when it was getting so dark? did you just think, i'll try to get it over and let him deal with trying to see it, try to get it back?
did you make any question about the light to anybody or you just kept playing?
do you think the last chance you had to win this match was when you had a breakpoint to go 5-3 in the fifth or later on?
you lost 11 breakpoints out of the first 12. for what reason was that? you were nervous. some returns were not at your usual standard, in my opinion. what do you think about it?
we know how much you respect him. especially after that tiebreaker, were there any points in there where you're thinking, this kid has to fold up now? he has to be a little bit mentally crazy? a couple times you were down, served your way out of some real holes. did you think at any point that he's got to crack at some stage?
you have such a deep love of the game and respect for it. the match today had so many elements, such a high level. leading commentators are already talking about it being the best match in the history of this game. could you reflect on that. can you sense people would put it in that strong context already?
was this the toughest match of your career?
how are you feeling after another long day on court?
were you worried after 6-1 in the first set it was going to be all over in an hour?
a five-hour match the day before isn't exactly the ideal preparation for a match against rafael nadal. how do you think the match yesterday influenced today's match?
what do you put your success down to in this tournament?
how do you see the final going on sunday?
you say you've been practicing with roger this week. are you going to be hitting with him for the preparation on sunday?
what, if anything, would you have done differently?
after your last match you said it would be very difficult, probably too difficult, to beat roger federer. how difficult is that right now with how well is he playing?
what are your thoughts if he is facing rafael nadal in the final about that matchup?
who do you think will win?
a lot of guys go out there against federer and get overwhelmed. looked like you were holding your own with him for long periods. is that encouraging for you for the future?
your two breakpoints you could have done a little bit better.
you said in answer to the first question that you know the game plan, you know what you have to do to beat him. can you describe that a little bit?
does this wimbledon give you confidence you can get back to the top?
you said earlier something like you have the money to do whatever you want, and right now what you want to do is play tennis. talk a little bit about your passion for the game. when did you felt you lost that passion?
do you have any idea what you'll do after your career?
you said, we love to suffer. what do you mean by that? overcoming challenges?
what do you think of the nadal/federer rivalry compared to sampras and agassi? do you find it interesting? or not so good that they're two good friends?
why?
how will history remember federer and nadal, do you think?
how will history remember safin?
you seemed to be very relaxed and confident. at 2-all in the third set you hit one shot under the leg, another one behind the back. is that what you really felt at that moment?
was it easy today?
were you relieved it was straight sets, given that rafa might have a quick one?
what were you reading from marat safin's attitude on the other side of the net? were you expecting something else, other kind of attitude?
now that you're here in the final, how would you describe your whole route to get to this point?
assuming it is rafael nadal in the final, what do you think the match could turn out to be after that incredible last year?
it's been a while since you've been in a wimbledon final not as the sort of racing certainty favorite. will that make life a bit easier for you in that you're not such a heavy favorite this time?
would you say you're playing better than ever this year, right now?
knowing you are a tennis expert, you like to do trivia tennis questions to your colleagues sometime, do you know anything about william renshaw, the fact he won six times here in a row?
have you studied this?
does your tough loss in paris, presuming rafa gets into the final, put a little different complexion on the next match?
is it sort of a pain in the neck for you or something that keeps things interesting that you have a guy so close nipping at your heels, challenging you all the time?
the women's finalists are obviously playing doubles together. have you had any interaction with rafa these last two weeks, or do you stay out of each other's way?
ancic.
when you come to wimbledon, do you keep the same routine in terms of where you stay, your restaurants, the time you eat? how superstitious are you?
have you ever thought to play doubles one day with rafael nadal just for fun?
a lot of people had given you up for dead not long ago. here you are in the semis. tell us a little bit about how you turned it around.
it's ironic it would happen in wimbledon, isn't it?
the match today, he played short to the backhand. how tough was it to play that?
you win a grand slam; you get injured; you play not so great; win a grand slam; injured; play not so great. does the career of marat safin sometimes surprise you?
is it more interesting to have a career like this?
do you think the rain break helped you? you seemed a lot calmer when you came out after the break.
looked almost old school at times, serving and volleying a lot. people are saying the courts are so slow. what gives with that?
how much of your happiness overall has to do with winning?
but for a guy who's won grand slams then, the bigger happiness has to come from the major titles, beating the best players.
does this tournament prove to you once again exactly how good you can be and can still be? roger said your ranking is ridiculous.
how close are you to your best level?
how do you see your semifinal with federer shaping up? do you believe you can beat him at this tournament?
what part of your game were you particularly happy with today?
if that's the case, where did this win rate among your other great wins at wimbledon? was it your best performance here?
why is that?
how important was it to be aggressive from the very start today? although you say you were nervous, it was important to impose your game on him.
was it difficult for you that everybody supported murray?
at 5-4 in the third set, the crowd were hoping for the same thing that murray did to gasquet. were you conscious of that?
do you think you've served better on grass than you did today?
if rafa nadal of this year played rafa nadal of last year in a match, what would the score be?
what's the score?
the one thing in your game that's better this year?
you talked about your tactics and your plans when you went into the game, how you would play andy murray. who exactly makes the plans? is it you or your coach?
how do you feel about the inevitable prospect of playing roger federer in the final compared with this stage last year?
one set all.
do you think you have a better chance of winning the tournament than 12 months ago?
have you watched last year's final again?
will you watch it before sunday if you get there?
this point you didn't make in last year's final, this break opportunity, chance to pass him, is it still here?
if you made the final, is your family ready to come to england to watch you?
based on today, what do you think andy murray has to do to make the next step up in his game?
spain have gone to no.1 in the world football rankings. do you think we could have a no.1 in the world for tennis and football?
i mean you.
you looked amazing. what do you think you must improve in your game?
you are a real madrid supporter. what do you think of cristiano ronaldo going to real madrid?
will it be good?
few complaints over that result?
how frustrating is it when you're against someone who is playing like that? what's going through your mind?
has he moved on as a player from when you played him in australia?
was tiredness a factor from gasquet the other night?
with rafa being just 22 and getting better and better on grass, he looks like he's going to be a huge obstacle for so many years now in your dream of winning wimbledon. that's the worry, isn't it?
what do you take out of this year's wimbledon overall?
you said before the match that you thought the way you wanted to play was to play aggressively against nadal. did you feel you just didn't get the chance to do that because of the way he was playing?
when you see how well he played today, how much of a chance does he have to beat federer this year, do you think?
what do you feel you need to improve especially in your game?
a great deal of interest in you and your background and family at this tournament. how do you think that's impacted on you? a lot more intense this year.
do you think your best chance of winning a grand slam is outside of wimbledon, with all the local pressure here?
is rafa's ball the heaviest in tennis, do you think?
is his serve underrated? you didn't get a breakpoint on it today.
what are the strengths of his serve? it's not a big, booming, acing serve, is it?
after winning queen's, nadal said he really worked on his slice backhand. how much do you think that was a factor today?
how has kim supported you this week?
what do you expect to do the next few days and weeks?
there was a lot of talk it would be a 50/50 split with you and rafa, with the crowd. didn't feel like that. felt like they were right behind you tonight.
how would you describe the state of your game at this point in the tournament compared to previous wimbledons?
and your level of confidence at this moment compared to when you've been in similar situations during your run of five straight titles, how would you describe it?
were you more pleased with the way you served or the way you returned today?
the last match you played with him, does that seem like ancient when you see that?
could you talk about your recollections about your match with pete? is it clear almost in a game-to-game...
at this stage in your career, when you go out to practice your serve, is your serve at a level where you're practicing just to sort of keep it sharp, or are you still trying to perfect and develop new places in the court to hit? i mean, are you still working on developing it or is it maintaining it?
you've been involved in a lot of streaks. where does 17 semis rank or mean to you?
how dangerous is safin now? obviously he's not the same player as 2005, but he's got the two grand slam titles and he's obviously motivated again. do you see him at the same danger level you might have a few years ago?
what stands out most in your semifinal in australia three years ago against him?
that first set was pretty exceptional. is there one match in your head that you have as sort of the ideal, where that's been as well as you've played? is there one match that ranks above the others in terms of quality?
do you have a sense to how close you are to that level?
unless i missed something, you seem to have gone through virtually the entire tournament without being under real intense pressure, in a comfort zone. what does that say that you've been able to get all the way to the semis that way?
yes.
when you play as well as you did today, is there any reason why you shouldn't think in terms of not just a sixth title here but perhaps even a seventh?
how the quality of your game is connected with other parts of your life, social, personal? is it all together, or the quality of your game is separate?
they showed how earlier in your career you used to smash racquets when you were a teenager. where did all that anger go? does that ever still seep into your mind now? you've learned to be more calm on the court?
what was the difference of this match and the other time?
at fifteen minutes, can you describe a little bit that game? that game was actually almost the length of the first set.
can you speak a bit about what makes his serve so difficult? because he's not so tall and the serve is not the fastest, but why is it so difficult for the returner?
when you come into today's match, i realize you played him very recently on clay in paris. but coming into this match here, do you have in your mind memories, thoughts at all about your victory over him here?
you've been through a tough time physically. i think i heard you said, my dream was to play again on centre court a federer match. was it as good as you had in mind?
is this 2008 wimbledon like a landmark now again, your comeback?
having just played federer, for the next match, federer versus safin, who would you put your money on?
can you compare the federer of today to the federer you played here and beat in 2002?
do you think you did not have the level of fitness, having played such an extended match two days ago?
just an explanation why you are back. you are now in quarterfinals of wimbledon.
i remember when you reached the finals of the australian open, you explained you were working many hours a day. perhaps this was one of the reasons of the injuries afterwards, that you did too much?
how important is today's victory for you?
how is your knee?
have you had it checked out?
you weren't too concerned then, even when you had to have the restrapping? you weren't too bothered? you felt okay, felt fine?
was there ever a moment you thought you would have to pull out?
how much have you had to battle through pain in your career, and how important is that quality in you?
can we say that today the match was easier than expected for you?
have you ever had the problem with your knee before? have you had the same trouble with your knee before?
it was below the knee?
have you had that before?
could you talk us through the challenges you would face with your next opponent, gasquet or murray.
do you think today was your most complete performance so far at wimbledon?
if it is andy murray in the next game, do you think the wimbledon crowd will be a difficult thing to overcome?
before the tournament started you said your idea of a dream would be for spain to win the football and for you to win wimbledon. how do you feel halfway now?
did you celebrate last night?
you won 21 points at the net out of 24. what does it mean for you?
how did you celebrate the football result?
champagne or jumping did you say?
where did you watch it and who was with you?
have you sent any messages of congratulations to any of the players?
did you find it quite draining, watching the game last night? was it hard emotionally? did it take a lot of energy out of you?
if andy murray doesn't win wimbledon, do you think the crowd here would like you to win it more than anybody else now?
federer said before that he had a quiet week. can we say the same for you, you had a quiet week?
do you think your knee will require any more treatment?
was that the most bizarre match you've ever played in?
the finish of the match.
that moment at the end of the tiebreak, that incredible running backhand into the crowd almost on set point.
were you confident you would finish the match tonight? there was no question in your mind they might hold it over?
when you flexed your biceps at the end, what sort of message were you trying to send out?
no warning to rafa nadal that you're coming to get him then?
how important was the crowd? do you think it's a match you would have won at any other arena?
you faced quite an onslaught. you said you were outplayed in the early stages. was there ever a moment you thought you might be going home, that was it?
how would you have felt if he had served it out?
in your sort of back catalog of matches so far, that's got to rate up there, given the stage, the tournament you're at, as your finest performance?
the circumstances of tonight's match, they give you an extra bit of momentum going into the match against nadal?
aside from eating and sleeping, what else do you plan to do tomorrow?
when you hit that incredible winner from way off the court by the photo pit, you let out this incredible howl that went on and on. seemed like you were king of the world. what were you feeling at that particular moment?
was it more about heart and mind at the end rather than ability?
how much did you learn when you played nadal in australia in that five-setter, and how will it help you when you face him again over best-of-five?
after tonight, do you feel you can go on to win the whole thing?
what are you eating just now?
when you thought about wimbledon, about putting yourself in a position like this, had you ever tried to imagine what 15,000 people standing on your feet chanting your name at the end of a fantastic five-setter would be like? and what was the actuality like in the moment?
do you feel like they'll be that bit louder than they might otherwise have been when you take on nadal because of the emotion and the drama that you brought tonight?
on that note, do you prefer playing late in the day, given how late tonight went?
what do you think of jamie's new hairdo?
it's getting darker and darker on the court. the crowd is howling for murray. what were your feelings?
what were you doing out there so late? were you asking yourself, why are we out here? it's so dark.
do you think they should have called off the match, suspended play earlier because of the light?
have you ever played in a situation like that before, where you know if you could win one more game, probably it will be suspended at 5-5? was that a pressure?
you played big davis cup matches before. what was the effect of the centre court crowd so intensely for andy?
did you feel very alone out there on centre court?
how far do you think he can go in the tournament?
in the fourth set, on set point, i think it was a backhand volley. it went far to the outer court. what were you thinking before andy retrieved it and made that incredible shot? did you think you had the point?
yes.
do you think lleyton hewitt has the ability to get back up into the top three or four players? people talk about his speed and strength, but perhaps he doesn't have the shot-making ability. is that the difference that makes it harder for him against you and rafael nadal and the others?
could you reflect on playing mario again. when he beat you here, did you think that this was a guy you were going to have a rivalry with for years and years?
have you learnt from that? did you learn for your future matches?
at the press conference you held before the tournament started, you spoke a little bit about people who have written that you might be vulnerable, you might be in decline, and all of that. how have you maybe answered all of that with how you've played this fortnight?
there's been a bit of an issue raised today. maybe it was a little disrespectful to put venus williams, a four-time champion, out on court 2. would you, if they scheduled you there, have felt it would have been disrespectful, being the defending champion, not to be? she didn't raise the point. she took the high road.
how have the courts changed here from when you won first in 2003 until today?
what do you see as the biggest similarities and the biggest differences between you and rafael nadal?
can you elaborate a little bit on the differences?
how does that affect your matchup, do you think, the appeal of your matchup?
hawk-eye do anything to get back a little bit in your good graces, that call in the breaker?
the overrule on the lob.
you still don't think that beats the alternative, which would have been two wrong calls basically?
you look at your stats after this match. reconfirming the way you would have wanted to play, adjusting for your next match, how much of what you'll do next match will depend on what you read there?
he's a former no.1. he's won some slams. now he's struggling, he's had injuries that were pretty clear today. when you're on the court, do you have capacity for empathy? do you look across the net and see a former playing struggling, gritting it out, or does that not come into your thinking out there?
the extra day. a good weekend?
watched the soccer?
you couldn't have expected this at the beginning of the tournament.
is this almost as good as reaching the final in australia 2001 or do you have to go further to emulate that?
there's also a chance of a maybe a semifinal place, rainer schuettler, rather than another seeded player.
how much did last year's doubles success help you playing on grass?
unusual for a frenchman to be happy to play on grass.
looking at the statistic sheets for the match today.
the line that says, "61% effectiveness at the net," is that going to be enough to beat roger federer?
so let's talk about the match you just played. could you talk about this match.
was the leg bothering you?
could you give us an impression of what wimbledon does for you. it has an effect on certain players. clearly i think it has an effect on you and your game. an impression of what it means to come here and play well?
at some point you're going to have to turn your attention to the quarterfinals. judging yourself by the way you served and volleyed today, are you satisfied with that? is that going to be good enough?
it's so unusual for a tennis player to go to law school. could you tell us a little bit about that. certainly in all the hours of studying law there must have been one thing that has helped you with your play on the tennis court.
and your favorite part of the law?
when you beat roger here six years ago, where did you think your game would be six years from then and where did you think roger's would be six years from then? where did you think you would be today with your games?
we all know the story of the illness, what have you. when you were suffering, maybe at your lowest moments, do you imagine something in tennis that will inspire you to come back? i'm hoping you're going to say centre court. is there something you really focus on to help your recovery?
roger has said before and reconfirmed to us today that he underestimated you back in 2002 and it was his own fault. does the fact that you beat him six years ago on grass, and you're one of the few guys that knows what it feels like to beat him on grass, is that going to help you not to overestimate him, not to give him too much respect?
13-11 in the fifth. where do you stand on whether it should be a tiebreak to end it in the fifth or whether we should continue playing out like this?
first of two wins for spain against germany this weekend, you hope.
you've said on the television you have the other spanish players coming to your house tomorrow.
when you play a singles match, what do you enjoy most about having just one other person out there on the field of play with you? what do you like most about this aspect of the competition?
how much do you enjoy the mental side of going against just one other person and you're the only two people out there?
were you struggling to see the ball near the end? how were you finding it?
was it hard to see?
your thoughts on the match tomorrow? are you confident?
the football tomorrow, are you confident?
you could have helped them with your win tonight.
what do you think about andy murray's progress so far? is he looking fitter and stronger to you?
no different to previous years?
looks he can go the distance now.
possibly.
if you met him in the quarterfinal, would you be prepared to be the villain of centre court?
your routine before each point where you take a long time bouncing the ball, how important is that to you to take so much time and to set yourself?
when you think back to your matches over the years with roger federer, you think about your differences in styles, how different is it, and what is so different between the two of you? you and roger federer, what are the biggest differences between the two of you?
and what's similar, the same, or close to the same?
could you give an assessment of how well you thought you played this afternoon.
the key to lapses of concentration is what happens next. i guess you regrouped pretty quickly. you must have been encouraged by that.
that third game in the third set lasted 10 minutes. there was the decisive line call on the backhand down the line. did you actually see it as good, or were you hoping you would be vindicated with the call?
how do you see the match with gasquet?
before the match, michael stich claimed that your second serve probably wasn't good enough. did that fire you up at all? your first serve was very good. in the interview afterwards, your opponent said you were serving well, you deserved to win. but then he said he didn't think your second serve was good enough, although he admits he couldn't get hold of it properly. does that concern you at all, or are you happy with it?
can you describe for us what it's like to have the centre court crowd at your back, behind you, supporting you, when you're in that tight set-all situation, what that is actually worth in terms of motivation to give that you that extra edge?
it's becoming a factor that you're making work for you. you are remaining very calm out there. at the same time you're getting a sense that this country is really wanting you to succeed here.
can you talk about your physical condition, how important that will be going into the second week.
obviously you had that very close match against him in bercy. what do you think you need to do better? it didn't seem there was that much in it between you.
you have just the one day off tomorrow before your next match on monday. can you outline how you'll spend sunday preparing for monday?
what will you do differently?
with your new team, you have a canadian, louis cayer, working with you. can you tell me where he fits into your whole operation?
you seemed really pumped up today. i noticed you turning towards the player's box where your mom was and also your girlfriend. your mom leapt off her seat when you hit a passing shot. is it comforting to you knowing they are sitting by the courtside? does it help they're there? they're not always at tournaments you play at around the world.
can you tell us in your own words how much it would mean to you to get that first grand slam quarterfinal? was that something you set out as a target for this year?
you talked with us beforehand about conserving your energy, keeping yourself calm on the court. has it been difficult to keep your calm? how much benefit are you feeling from having adopted this approach?
did you feel after the second set maybe andy was struggling? his serve seemed to go.
how do you rate his chances in the rest of the competition?
what was it like playing out there?
do you feel his game has developed, is still developing?
were you surprised or impressed by his temperament? he kept calm when it got tough.
were you pleased with that victory in the end?
you must be pleased with the fact that you could fight. earlier in the year you said you felt a bit burned out. do you feel your energy is returning?
what has brought that feeling back?
there's no remnant of the knee injury? that's okay now?
how much is last year's experience going to help you continue, do you think, or hope?
we don't know the result yet, but do you have any preference between andy murray and tommy haas?
you have beaten andy murray twice. that must give you enormous confidence, even though the crowd will be with andy.
how well are you playing right now?
were you happy with your shot selection at times this afternoon?
is serve and volley something you want to do a little more of?
if you play andy murray in the next round and beat him, you will be the villain of wimbledon. will you enjoy that title?
you seemed to mix topspin and flatter driving quite a lot of the time. was this a particular tactic against gil?
can you tell us a bit about how hard you have worked in the last few weeks to get back your fitness. everything i read about you it talks about your natural talent, but there must be a lot of hard work as well.
and obviously in this last month you have worked especially hard to get your fitness back?
how long did the knee affect you, and how long now have you been fully fit?
and how long have you been 100%? how long has the fitness been right?
it's now better?
how long has it been since it's been better?
how many times have you played the hometown favorite maybe in australia and new york? knowing if you do have to face andy, the whole of the stadium will be for him. how will you psych yourself up to face that?
is it intimidating having to play roger federer, or do you treat him differently to any other player?
do you go to bed thinking, i've got to play my best tennis? is that what you have to aim for?
what will you need to do well to beat him?
coming into this tournament there's a lot of talk about roger going more susceptible or vulnerable. do you buy into that at all?
you've played through injuries here, of course. did you see what tiger woods did recently at the u.s. open, and what are your thoughts on what he did? any parallels?
through the years, how has your approach to injuries changed in regards to letting on to opponents, not letting on, complaining about them or not complaining about them?
how come?
does the extra day help?
how would you compare your feeling about divulging information about injuries and the way you handle it with other people you've observed on the tour?
tactic-wise, how much of a difference can it make to have roger's former coach on your side now?
concerning today's match, what do you think about bolelli? did you see any difference from last year?
both you and roger are so experienced on grass. how do you think that's going to influence your match?
in terms of a mindset against him, do you go into the match thinking that this is the type of challenge you play for, or do you try and treat it like you would any other match mentally?
do you think that helps you to find something more to bring to the match?
specifically, other than roger just improving immensely since when you were getting over on him consistently, what parts of his game do you think really, really improved?
do you feel like you have to play a little bit outside of yourself in the match, or is that sort of a risk, because you don't want to get out of your own comfort zone, too?
he remembers your first match at 15-year-olds. do you?
do you remember who won?
you've played him since tony roche has been your coach?
of all the streaks that you're aware of in sport, and tennis specifically, how do you rate 62 straight wins on grass, five straight wimbledon crowns?
when you watch federer and nadal, what strikes you the most in the way of differences and similarities?
a while back you had some really nice wins over roger. at that time, if someone said that this guy was going to step it up and take it to you 11 straight times, what would you have said to them?
in terms of greatest player of all time, how would you compare him and pete?
you've been one of the best return of servers of your era. facing roger, he's not serving bombs like sampras, but holds easily. what makes his serve so tough?
marat safin, after his win a couple days ago, thanked the club for slowing down the courts. how have you seen the courts change here over the years, and how does the change affect your chances?
you must be very satisfied with your first week's work.
do you think you have a psychological advantage on lleyton hewitt?
you've beaten a lot of players, but you seem to have beaten him resoundingly. do you think you have any sort of advantage over him?
the fact that he's the only other person here who's won, does that make any difference?
what do you like most about being on the court of play with just one other person, that one-to-one aspect of your competition?
you come here, you stay in a house and not a hotel, you're not in a big city, and you now presumably have three days off. how big a deal are these different rhythms, just different vibes that this place has as opposed to the other three slams?
is there any sense that you accelerated in the third set because of the risk of rain, or was that just how it happened spontaneously?
there is a feeling watching that maybe you did accelerate.
it's just the way it happened?
you mentioned there are more baseline players now. do you find that's wearing the grass away on the baseline and causing strange bounces?
there were a couple of big surprises yesterday: roddick and blake going out. did you see the games? what did you think?
how do you assess the state of the draw three rounds in?
obviously in the tournament here at wimbledon there's been a lot of upsets of the top seeds. yet slam after slam you're getting deep in the semis and finals. aside from the obvious sheer talent, what is the key, the important part of being able to get into the semis and finals?
do you feel at this tournament more than others that you have something to prove?
what do you make of the notion that squash shots are occasionally being played or shots that come out of the squash game are being played today?
last year when you talked to us here in this room after your last match you were pretty distraught. what is your feeling right now?
did you feel you had clean shots at those three set points in the fourth?
what were you trying to do with the flat-footed shot you tapped back into the net?
the kind of surplus of emotion you talking about something you learned how to handle in davis cup. is this the one spot where it's still hard for you to overcome?
do you feel like you played like crap the whole match or just like crap on the big points?
after the match, was it more right away anger at yourself, disappointment, shock?
how do you correct the tightness?
what within the match did you try to do to correct it?
outside of the breakpoints, you get into the breaker there, it's a whole different match. take us through the tiebreak there.
yes.
on the third set point, did he surprise you with the serve and volley? did that have any affect on the return?
you said before about just wanting this so much. can you try to explain to us how much you want this? when you come into this tournament, what are you feeling?
given that you have set up your whole summer to give yourself the best chance at the us open, that's putting a lot of eggs in the basket. will it be hard to not put too much pressure on yourself?
so you think that is a fair question we should be asking you? win another slam or what? or that is your feeling inside?
you've been on top before, so right.
taking the rolling stones analogy a step further, is it sometimes better to get that seat in the front row when you're a little bit older than getting it when you're younger?
have you seen the stones?
what row were you in?
if you do get to the front row, how do you think that will change things?
as far as wanting to win another grand slam, how do you think that would feel?
it was kind of a bizarre day. davenport pulls out, blake loses, maria gets upset, you. do you ever get a sense of that, or are you within your own world, all these other things are happening around me?
you've given up the olympics to get ready for the us open and hard court season. is it going to be easy to stay loose playing the open with that kind of a decision behind you, to go in there and feel like you can play?
the way the match started, was there perhaps a fear in your mind you may have missed kickoff?
with losing the first set, there was a fear that the match might drag on.
in the first set you got to a dropshot on time, but the umpire incorrectly ruled it. looked like you flew into a rage. what was the conversation you had with him about that?
the challenge for you in this match was to find a way to stop all of his power, his great serving. did you change tactics here and there to find a way to win this match?
how dangerous do you think gulbis will be when he has more experience?
i know the spanish players are proud of how well they're doing on grass right now. do you feel like you led that progress? were you the leader for the spanish players on grass?
are you happy with today's performance?
he hit a great number of dropshots today. for the most part you did not do well with them.
have you ever had a day where you had a worse day dealing with someone else's dropshots?
what can you do about it?
you are very young, but he obviously is still a teenager. does it make you feel old to play a player that young?
you are aware that manolo santana won this tournament in 1967.
so when they ask you if you're the leader of spaniards on grass, he would be the leader, right?
are you friends with any of the spain footballers on duty at the moment? has there been any contact between you in the past few days? have you been in touch with them, encouraging each other?
do you think the good weather is helping your game this year?
when playing gulbis, which shot did you find the most challenging with him being so young?
is it a special challenge? do you enjoy playing younger guys because you have to be a little more careful because you don't know them so much?
what are your expectations for the game tonight that spain will be in?
any other details that you'll be looking for?
xavier came in saying how impressed he was with your serve. do you feel it's really evolving as a real weapon on grass?
16 aces, 136 miles an hour. looks like andy roddick, never mind andy murray.
what different threat does tommy haas present?
what do you remember when he beat you in indian wells this year?
how much confidence can you take from beating sort of a decent player quite so comprehensively in the second round of a slam?
have you ever played football after a match point?
what is your keepy-uppy record, andy?
after two games, is your game where you want it to be? it looks very positive. is there anything that you're a little bit concerned about? was everything pretty much what you'd expect at that stage?
you look incredibly relaxed. haven't seemed stressed at any stage, unless i'm misreading it.
when you've been leaving wimbledon in the evenings, are you finding it easy to switch off?
what was the reason for that? obviously you lost your keys, but why?
how long did you get stuck out there for?
you were wearing the cap. i have to ask. is the cap still around?
the scottish cap.
white stripe on it.
i've lost track myself. is the hat in a bag somewhere? is it a lucky thing?
would you say it's been a perfect start to wimbledon for you?
you said you take your dog out for a walk. what is the dog's name?
how old is she?
is that just something to relax, take your mind off tennis?
what breed is it?
four or five years ago when nobody knew who you were you would have followed this tournament, seen tim the center of all the attention. does it seem funny now for you to be in that role?
so you're managing the high expectations better than in previous visits here?
the crowds have been quite calm until that moment as you started to serve for the final game. really a moving applause for you. how did that feel?
if you can get back into your apartment tonight, will you watch the spain-russia game?
have you been following the tournament?
are you shouting for anybody in particular?
is a player allowed to back himself in tennis? can a player have a bet on himself?
seems silly. you're not going to throw a game if you back yourself.
so the answer is no?
any particular reason for the name maggie, and does she watch your matches?
how tough was it for you today?
you've been to the semis. has he got what it takes to get that far?
it seems like the serve is the thing that impressed you most. that has come on a lot, hasn't it?
there's also a bit of variety to his game that perhaps you don't get with some of the other top players.
what happened at the end?
you didn't think of changing your mind and saying you weren't ready?
tommy had a good win today. you know what he can do. do you think he's equipped at this stage of his career to hurt andy?
can you give us your impressions? do you feel like you're on a roll at the moment?
physically how are you?
is it a situation where you erase the thoughts that something might crop up because you've had such a run of bad luck or take whatever comes, it's a bonus?
xavier said he has seen you putting the hard work in. he says you have a great chance against andy. how do you rate it?
you served and volleyed a lot in your match today. is that something you're trying to do more now that you're on the grass?
do you think you're still owed some years on the circuit because of the injuries that have taken so much away from you? do you think you're owed something?
at the start of the year, what were your expectations for this season?
being your own best critic, knowing you've been a former world no.2, how would you assess the actual level of what you're producing now and what you're still capable of producing?
do you ever get fed up of rehab?
the rehab, when there's a chance now, a possible centre court with andy murray at wimbledon, this is why you play?
you turned the big 30 this year. you talked in the past about andre agassi doing so well into his 30s. do you think you can be successful well into your 30s?
what are you going to do tonight? celebrate?
quite an achievement to get as far as you did, though.
do you think you did yourself justice in that game?
how did you feel about the support on court 1?
did you see some of the t-shirts people were wearing?
which one was that?
did you notice that some of the support seemed more female-dominated than male?
a bit of a consolation, quite a good paycheck to take home with you tonight.
how did you feel when you stepped out onto court 1 with everyone cheering for you?
it looked like you were deep in thought in some of the breaks. what was going through your mind at that time?
how important is it for you to come back and build on this? every year there's normally one brit who does well for a while and then disappears. we never hear of him again. it's obviously important for you to come back and show you're not a one-year wonder sort of thing.
how will your success here affect your schedule? are you going to try to get into some different tournaments you haven't maybe considered?
are you going to take any kind of break between now and your next games?
you seemed to follow your serve in a bit less than your first-round game. was that right?
does getting experience playing at the highest level increase your appetite to succeed?
how would you sum up your two matches at wimbledon, your wimbledon experience this year?
have you spoken to tim or greg or andy?
do you have a message for the fans who cheered you on today or tuesday? what would that message be?
did you hear any particular calls that slightly distracted you?
has this given you a taste for wimbledon? will you be back next year?
what about a new car? have you had a chance to think about a new set of wheels?
get the wing mirror fixed maybe?
did you start to become a grass court player suddenly?
an important match.
how did you play?
so you're not surprised by yourself?
how would you rate your game today on a scale of 1 to 10?
is it a 5 or 8?
when was the last time you played that well?
novak said it was a case of him playing badly rather than you playing well. would you agree with that?
when you walked off, the bbc man asked you about your next opponent. you implied you didn't expect to get past djokovic, and you didn't know who you were going to play next. is that right?
what do you remember of the things you've said about wimbledon last year and in the recent past, and how do you feel about wimbledon now?
what do you like the most about wimbledon, and what do you dislike the most about wimbledon?
novak said when you played in australia 2005...
yes. he said he had great respect for you because he practiced with you as a junior. he said today it might have been a factor in this match that he had too much respect for you.
do you think?
you looked very fit today. do you think was this the key to play at this level?
you expected to be back in russia tonight?
have you booked another flight, or not till a week on monday?
you had a ticket for this flight?
we see russia is doing well in the football at the moment at the european championships. what does it say for russia?
how have you managed to keep faith in yourself? you're working hard, going out, playing matches, wins aren't coming, month after month. you get on court today against arguably has been the best player of the year and showed some pretty good stuff.
i was expecting you to be at roland garros for your sister's final.
is this the kind of result that would keep you on the tour? is this the sort of victory you need?
if you play on the centre court like today, it's like the place you feel you belong to?
against seppi, next match, you have to play on a small court. what do you think about your opponent?
given how tough it was the other day, how much of a bonus was it for you today to get through so quickly?
how is the hip feeling?
did it pull up all right from your first match? you said it all depended on how it pulled up.
would you be surprised if bolelli gets through here?
after the first set, what was the switch? you won nine games in a row from there.
if it came down to it, do you think your body would have seven matches in it over these two weeks?
what do you do to block it out of your mind? obviously it's always there. you've got to do something to get through it. what do you do?
just to try to get an understanding of what you are feeling, can you rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10?
you're a guy who had a lot of success when you were young, like novak. when you start to go consistently deep at majors and then have a setback, what do you do to regroup?
you and marat are sort of the same generation. older guys still making a little bit of noise here.
one of your old coaches, stolz, has had a bit to say about tennis australia, what is and isn't being done at the moment. do you have any thoughts on the current state of development in australia, and is there something that's not being done that you'd like to see done or vice versa?
if we could go back to your hip. you're obviously sore now having come off the court. how do you feel compared to where you thought you'd be or were hoping to be at this stage of the tournament?
good to get that third set out of the way?
he's a big server. do you like it when the serve comes at you faster than normal? 140 miles an hour at one point.
did you see anything of marat's win over novak?
what did you make of it?
not a bad day for you all in all with novak out of your half of the draw, a good workout today against soderling.
was there anything in robin's play that annoyed you during the match?
what do you make of the condition of the grass this year?
when is the last time you actually looked at the rankings to see who's coming up behind you?
you hadn't dropped a service game since the french open. obviously you don't like to lose streaks like that. was it better to sort of get it out of the way in the third-set situation today than in a tighter situation?
do you remember nishikori, the japanese tennis player? he had a grand slam debut this wimbledon. could you tell us your impression of his performance this year.
do you usually change racquets a game or two before the ball change? you seemed to do that today. was that the conditions, or do you usually do that here?
novak said after the first round that you sort of spoke a little bit between your match and his. you sort of talked about the grass, what condition it was like, all that sort of thing. did you sort of meet him today after his match or between matches today at all?
did you talk at all between the matches?
was a bad day at the office for you or a very good day for safin, a bit of both? what surprised you most?
you finally did find your serve a little bit midway through the second set and got into the tiebreak. you lost it again. after the frustration of finding your serve and losing the tiebreak, did you just not feel like you could give everything you had in the third set?
you talked about the double-faults and the unforced errors. john mcenroe said after the match he thought you looked tired and that maybe you had played too many matches. what do you think?
have you seen him play that well in recent years?
you said you were mentally tired. is it the traveling, so much matches, dealing with the press every day, day after day?
there was a sort of warm embrace between the two of you at the end. do you know each other particularly well, or do you just get on well?
considering instability, can we say you were waiting for him to make his usual mistakes, but they were just not coming today?
which of these two matches against marat hurts the most: getting completely crushed at the australian open or here where you're the no.3 seed and have established yourself as a top player, losing to a no.65?
just an observation, but you didn't appear to be wearing your normal brand of shoe today. do you have an issue with the grass?
because you had the problem last year that forced you to withdraw?
must be a little bit of a strange feeling. it's been a while since you lost this early in a grand slam.
what are you going to do to regroup from here? any lessons you've taken away from it at this point?
how will you regroup? what will you do?
safin has been no.1 in the world. he played very well everywhere, but not that well normally on grass. he lost many matches in his life on grass. do you think today he was playing extremely well or it was just you?
how big of a chance do you give safin at this wimbledon? how big a chance do you give to the russians at the euro cup, if you're watching?
given the fact that you reached the semifinals here last year and your excellent results since, can you just sort for us how disappointing it is to be going out this early?
you played a pretty scrappy match. got to be fairly pleased. good rallies, did some things you wanted to do.
the guy on the bbc as you walked off the court asked you about cardigans, all that stuff. everybody has been talking about fashion, both men and women. do you think that's sort of like, who cares? do you enjoy the whole atmosphere here with that?
cardigans?
how are you feeling, your shoulder and all that?
is it because you're afraid to really to go into it, or you can actually feel it a little bit sometimes when you're serving?
do you feel as a two-time finalist you're kind of, maybe not forgotton, but not the one that everyone is talking about? is that good for you?
do you approach first-round matches at slams any differently than you did, say, four years ago, five years ago?
you're going to have a second match with tipsarevic. he's a real pesky player. what makes him so difficult to play?
he was a little bit of a problem in that match for a while, wasn't he?
he was a bit of a problem in that match two years ago.
how do you come to terms with how you exited last year? was that just one of those crazy matches where you're totally in control and somehow it unravels?
do you learn from that at all? next time you're a little more leery or tighter in your game when you get in a situation like that?
is it hard for you not to point ahead towards that match?
towards a rematch with gasquet.
semis.
did you speak to mardy at all after his match?
are you surprised he hasn't done better here over the years?
what would you think are some of the keys for you to have a great tournament?
within your game, what really has to be working?
if you the board and council elections this past weekend...
board of directors of the atp. where do you think the atp is headed?
are you a better player now than when you made the finals in '04 and '05?
are you feeling this is the right coaching situation for you, you're more comfortable in this, being with family?
do you know jesse levine pretty well? he won today. what would you say about his game?
mardy was saying a little while ago that you were skipping the olympics, carrying the load at the u.s. tournaments.
the events this summer in the u.s. the us open series, that you guys are going to be carrying the load there.
it's a long ways off, but some of the spaniards were upset at the davis cup tie being put in madrid.
i would imagine.
your thoughts? do you think that is an issue at all? do you think that will help us in any way in the altitude?
does patrick play a big role in that? is he the fighter in the boardrooms?
have you found a difference in how the ball travels in madrid?
but you felt it scoot a little bit more?
have you heard or read the term "the big three" as it refers to federer, nadal and djokovic?
as it's referred to now, in tennis. do you react saying, no, it's not really like that; tennis is much deeper? do you think the guys deserve it?
did you enjoy that?
was there a temptation to play it just for fun as opposed to concentrating on getting ahead and winning as straightforwardly as possible?
how did you feel beforehand? did you feel any nerves going out there?
it's obviously very entertaining to watch slices, lobs and dropshots. do you think it's possible to do that against some of the players you might face later? is that just a one-off today?
having waited so long to play this match, is there some sort of relief to get it out of the way now?
was the atmosphere on centre court how you remembered it two years ago, how the crowd got behind you? did you feel any difference at all this year to two years ago?
how different is the surface on centre court compared with the practice courts here or queen's?
as a player who can sort of drive people mad with frustrating them, is it a good workout mentally for you just to keep your focus against somebody like fabrice?
135 serves. that's become a key weapon on grass. getting over 130 as you're doing now, what has brought that about? is it just hard work?
can we expect you to get as muscular as rafael nadal then?
was it a conscious decision to do that, though? because you obviously decided to muscle up a bit to get more power.
you really notice a difference in a physical way since the last time you were here two years ago?
has your weight gone up?
sheer muscle, effectively?
how many of these chin-ups can you do before you collapse?
can you talk a bit more about malisse. he obviously has had some great performances. he's still dangerous, isn't he? he can produce some very good tennis.
you called for the towel after each and every point. is that a mental or psychological thing? is it superstition?
what did you say to santoro at the end?
andy murray is currently on court. there's a chance you may have to face him. can we have your thoughts on a possible showdown with him.
what is your record like against him?
what do you think the pressure is like for a guy like andy murray in these two weeks?
you must be very confident now.
this november, nick bollettieri is going to have a 30th anniversary of the facility. i'm sure you're probably going to be there.
what do you know about the whole 30-year history of this academy?
when you arrived there for the first time, was there any way to feel what it was like when agassi and jim courier were there?
if you had to remember one memorable story or anecdote about nick, what would it be?
are you relieved to have gotten past a potentially dangerous first-round opponent?
and was it easier than you expected?
with tsonga and monfils injured, do you feel you're carrying french hopes on your back here in wimbledon?
could you say that was one of the best matches you played since the quarterfinals here last year?
nice to be back on court 1?
do you feel refreshed, having taken the break over the french open? you withdrew quite late on. do you think it was a good thing you did?
you looked in very good form at queen's.
do you feel grass is your best surface?
do you have any idea why it's good for your game?
based on today's performance, do you think you can repeat your good result here last year?
sbastien grosjean next. you must know each other quite well.
how does that feel?
how does it compare to uzbekistan?
obviously you were playing well. how much were you lifted by the support?
six games to play to get here? you played prequalifying.
did you honestly think you had a chance of winning today?
could you talk us through your day. you went on quite late. were the nerves kicking in early morning?
talk us through your day.
did the match go in a blur or can you remember most of it?
a point when he got slightly angry about the call. how did you feel when that was going on?
what were you doing during last year's wimbledon?
lying on your back when you were injured?
can you tell us about your normal life. you've been to some pretty far-flung places, not picked up a lot of money. must be quite a hard grind for you.
what was the atmosphere like in uzbekistan?
what's the place like?
they didn't know you out there?
was this game a bit easier in that the crowd were there, the surroundings, lifts you, rather than going to place like that?
is it right that you might have restrung your own racquet this morning?
do you always do it yourself?
how many racquets did you take out there today?
will you restring them again for the next round?
was that the real you today or you lifted by the crowd? looked like you meant business. is that you or you rising to the occasion?
did you have a chance to see your mum and dad yet?
i know you're not in it for the prize money. how much have you earned in your career? how does 27,000 compare to what you've earned so far?
what car do you drive?
what are your own expectations now and how much are you inspired by the rise of andy murray?
does he talk to you about your game or anything?
has he given you any kind of advice?
you don't hit with him at all?
there's a davis cup tie here in september on the grass. anyone that can serve aces like that one would assume comes into contention. what are your thoughts on the whole situation?
can you tell us about yourself, when you started playing? you still live with your parents?
if you had a choice, would you go back onto court 3 or no.2 court or would you like to try one of the show courts?
what other sports were in the equation when you were a kid?
to what sort of level?
what are you going to do now to make sure this one victory at wimbledon isn't the last we hear of you and it's not a flash-in-the-pan sort of victory for you? what's your plans?
could you give us your initial thoughts about your second-round match? your opponent is quite a hothead, mr. tursunov.
what do you feel went wrong today?
do you feel it was more of a case of you playing badly than benjamin playing well?
would it have helped to have prepared more on grass rather than going to warsaw?
so no injury or physically not well?
it's almost a year since your match in poland that is still under investigation. what are your thoughts on how long it's taken, and why do you think it's taking so long?
has the atp received all that it's asked you for, except the records you can't get?
and what is it exactly that you haven't been able to turn over to the atp?
what has the atp asked for that you have not given?
regarding any match where there's the possibility of tampering or a fix, and it's proven, what do you think the penalty should be?
what are your thoughts on what the penalty should be if anyone gets caught being involved in match fixing?
what do you think about the length of time that it has taken to resolve this issue? because it's your reputation that's been in question for the last year. must be very upsetting for you.
your match aside, the one in poland, do you believe match fixing goes on in tennis?
so all that activity, all that betting on your match in poland, was that an accident? how do you explain that incredible level of betting?
has this been a bad dream for you?
are you confident about what the findings of the atp will be when it announces the results of its investigation? if so, what do you think will be announced?
if you were a betting man, who will you say will win the men's tournament here at wimbledon?
yes.
in your great career, what was the sweetest moment?
and what was it like for the swedes to bring down a team that was led by connors and mcenroe?
yourself excluded, who do you think the best doubles player in history of the game has been?
if you could change one thing in the game of tennis, aside from scheduling, what would you choose?
how would you compare today's player in 2008 with the best players when you came on tour? how has the game changed?
when did you actually make your mind up? is it something you thought about a long time ago and you just wanted to save the announcement for wimbledon, or just the last couple days or weeks?
in reading your statement, there don't seem to be any hard and fast plans. what sort of ideas do you have?
yes.
are you still doing the magazine?
the toughest single stroke? what is the toughest shot you've faced?
was he the best from the baseline?
people talk about the change of the grass. you played all the way through whatever change there might have been. do you prefer it now or did you prefer it then?
greatest player of all time?
convincingly over pete?
what are you going to play between now and the olympics?
how are your imitations going?
is mcenroe your best one?
a long time for a win like this. going back to bangkok last year a little bit.
how do you explain today?
was he playing bad or you were playing extraordinarily well?
it's been a long time since the agassi match. was that match any kind of burden for you emotionally?
is it any kind of a burden in terms of how people perceived you, what they expected of you?
how much time are you spending in south florida now?
girlfriend still there?
delray beach?
how have you enjoyed it down there?
you mentioned you grew up idolizing boris. was that an extra motivation to do well at wimbledon, obviously with the name?
did boris give you any tips?
before playing at wimbledon previously?
you must be very disappointed. can you explain the problems that you were experiencing with your abdomen and why you chose to retire when you did.
obviously, you're the youngest here. how disappointing was it for you having to pull out of this big moment for you in your career?
is it a long-term problem? when do you expect to be back?
yes.
what were your expectations coming into the tournament?
what did you expect? how did you expect to play coming into the tournament?
your thoughts on that one?
any idea why you didn't play well?
because you're known for your ability to come back in matches, to stick in there and come back. it just didn't happen tonight.
it's been sort of a frustrating couple of weeks for you. you did quite well at queen's until you played novak. now today. you can play on grass, can't you? you reached the final here. frustrating?
what were your expectations coming in?
physically you're fine? there was no problem with that? did you feel your preparation was good?
in what way?
what's the injury?
why?
just interested. no.
do you prefer not to talk about your injuries? are you worried that it will sound like you're making excuses, or...
did the injury hamper you on court?
you seemed quite flat emotionally. did you feel like that, or was it a physical thing?
were you flat mentally because of the physical problem?
you're known for going deep into grand slams. you haven't gone deep into a grand slam for quite a while now.
so what will you do next?
do you expect to be fit again relatively quickly?
no olympic games?
how would you actually summarize this disappointment? how disappointed are you today?
in the sense of overall.
obviously a very tough match. good to get through.
does it get harder to come through five-set matches like that as you get older, do you think?
do you think it was your experience that counted against his maybe?
these are pretty crucial times for the atp. are you satisfied with the board election that took place this weekend? do you favor retaining etienne de villiers as the chairman or would you like to see a change at the top?
does it worry you that it was that hard a game on day one? does it affect your confidence at all about how far you can go this time?
do your expectations lower as you get further away from 2002?
when you say "chalk and cheese," what do you remember of montanes from the last time you played him two years ago?
how, specifically, does the hip affect you when you're playing? is it about speed? is it about direction?
could you estimate what percentage fitness you are at at the moment?
what do you do treatment-wise between now and then?
how many foot faults were you called for? how distracting is that to you?
was he right to call your conduct unsportsmanlike?
whatever the guy in the chair called you unsportsmanlike for.
was it a fair call by him, or not?
when you come back each year, do you have any sense of how many more wimbledons you have left in you?
i think i'm right that you were hitting with andy murray over the weekend here.
can you give us an indication, did his game seem pretty sharp to you?
do you have any advice for gooch, whose grand slam record is a bit underwhelming at this point, and he had another disappointing loss today. do you speak to him at all about how he can turn things around? he is obviously the successor to you clearly when you do go.
what do you think of your draw with federer in the fourth round?
doesn't wake you up in the middle of the night?
do you spend much time with the sort of up-and-coming kids in australia like bernard tomic?
did it startle you a little bit when dominik suddenly sat next to you?
what did you say to him?
must be the first time you've walked out on centre court with people in certain quarters expressing some doubts about your game. did that have any effect on your psyche, or did it make you more determined going into this first-round match?
hrbaty has been a bit of a tricky customer in the past. were you expecting more of a testing match today?
anything different about the new grass this year?
what is your ideal first week? do you want three or four games as smooth for you as that, or would you rather have a match that's a lot tougher?
your junior years here, sleeping in the dorm, eating the english food, what do you remember coming as a junior player coming in here?
how relieved are you when you get a start like this?
are the first few rounds extra nerve-wracking?
your next opponent, soderling, you played him six times. some people say he should be a top 10 player, but he's missing the mental approach. is there something about his game?
when you're so far superior to an opponent, as you were today, particularly when it's a good friend, are there any feelings of awkwardness or discomfort in winning so efficiently and sort of ruthlessly?
where did the idea for the sweater come from? how much say did you have in the design?
pleased with that?
he rolled off five games at the end of the second set. was that a case of perhaps you had lost concentration?
it's probably the most famous tennis court in the world. is it a special place for you?
can you remember your first matches, who they involved, when you used to watch from home?
after such a great year that you've had, are having, have you noticed any more pressure on you now? when you're going around wimbledon, are you being stopped and recognized more than perhaps previously?
you said some people might not like you.
but you're a popular player, aren't you?
when you come to a tournament like wimbledon, how many people do you travel with?
how do you think about getting to the final four, the semis? do you think you have a good chance to get there? you've beaten lleyton hewitt here before. do you think he's still got the ability to think that he can get to the final four, perhaps the final?
not as good as he used to be?
we saw niki pilic around today. can you talk about your relationship with him?
was it good sort of preparation for later in the tournament today, have a big left-handed player smashing a few balls back at you?
what about more particularly the ball coming from the left side?
did you learn anything about yourself today, the adversity in the second set?
do you think the prospect of facing rafa on clay or roger on grass, which is the harder or the biggest challenge for you?
you talked about adapting to the conditions on centre court. how different does the grass play here compared to queen's?
there have been quite a few fashion statements today. roger federer's cardigan, serena williams' raincoat. have you thought of something, or is it an adidas policy to keep it a low profile?
about the fashion statements.
obviously disappointed, although i guess it's been a good week for you.
were you surprised you got to deuce the crowd really got up behind you? traditionally they get behind the home players. they seemed to like you a bit more today.
have you had that anywhere else, any other country where fans are behind you?
andy's won here today. he's no.3 in the world. he's a contender for wimbledon. how close is he to actually getting close to rafa and roger you think in the slam?
apart from the way he played the big points, was there anything that particularly struck you about the way he plays? you've obviously seen a lot of him, but you haven't actually played him in three years.
what can you take from your grass court play?
what's your schedule for next week? what are you planning to do training for wimbledon?
if we put you on the spot and said who is going to win wimbledon, what would you say?
you talked about avoiding andy in your half of the wimbledon draw. are you a player who actually looks at the draw and analyzes what you have to do to get through to the second week?
how is it? can you tell us what you've done and what the situation is?
kind of a freak accident, isn't it?
you weren't even running?
is it too early to say about wimbledon, or must you let it settle down for 24 hours to have a look at it again?
is it swollen up at all?
you've always worn the ankle straps, haven't you?
i guess it makes you think what it might have been if you hadn't had those on?
leaving aside wimbledon and your prospects there, how much of a blow is this? because you've been looking in such good form this week, hitting the ball great. your serve has been great.
you say you were laughing at james. because you had hit the ball through your legs...
you have such a great association with this tournament. does that add to the frustration of what happened today?
what's your take on james' chances in the final?
how surprised were you with the ease of that?
can we just establish how you end up looking like you've gone five rounds with a heavyweight fighter with blood all the way down your shorts and hands?
where is the cut actually?
knuckle?
you must be exceedingly pleased with the way that you're serving, you're returning, and your game has just flowed over to the grass very, very quickly. you're giving a lot of people reason to believe.
believe that you can do it, go into the wimbledon championships after a good finals tomorrow?
but a professional satisfaction you are in your first grass court championship here tomorrow, final?
can you analyze the matchup against both the guys in the other semi, please?
if it's andy, i mean, a lot has been said that andy got himself much fitter, like you did, got a bit of weight off and a new coach. have you noticed anything different about his game in the last six months than what it was before?
with roger and rafa not playing in a grass tournament, you know, leading up to this year's wimbledon, people will think you've had an advantage. i'm just wondering if you feel the same way.
what you said about the english country expecting huge things, what you've achieved here this week and should you win tomorrow, the expectation will be even higher. do you think there's too much expectation, too much pressure on you going into wimbledon?
a lot has been said and written about your use of the dropshot. i mean, it worked particularly well today, especially tempting him in and then hitting a lob over the top of him. is that a real tactic now on grass? it was always thought to be more sort of a clay court tactic. is it a real grass court tactic?
are you playing as well as you have ever been coming through this week and heading towards a major championship on the grass?
i'm talking about the way that you got onto the grass. you're playing well all aspects of your game. you must be again very confident in the way that you are approaching the championships.
it seemed quite low-key today. did you feel the crowd were on your side today or was it a very neutral crowd?
in light of that, last year there was a bit of an issue about your grass court shoes. you switched and you went i think from adidas to nike and now you're playing nike. your footing seems very, very good this year. you're obviously very happy with what you got on the soles of your feet.
still no deal then or anything?
just on the way you've been playing, how many more levels do you think you can go up to be playing your absolute best on grass?
you're playing a guy tomorrow now that hasn't played a full match today that -- i don't think andy was, his movement wasn't good after getting here, from what we saw when we came up here. could that be a plus or a minus for you?
we're viewing it as a three-quarter british final.
never the way you want to win a match, though, is it?
what did he say to you?
have you seen much of murray through this week? and what do you think of the way that he is dealing with the expectation which you saw another man go through?
do you notice any change in him at all in the locker room here compared to other tournaments?
you haven't played andy for a while, but you've obviously seen what he's been doing the last six, nine months. what do you think of it all?
how do you beat someone like that tomorrow?
you told me last year every time you come to england you do a little bit of, sort of a family outing. what's the plan this year?
what did you do last year?
you went to banbury-cross the year before.
you didn't go to oxfordshire or anything?
are there any family left in this part of the world?
getting a ticket for tomorrow?
pretty much what you expected, then?
did that sort of match tell you anything about your game?
pat cash said this week that european players have a big advantage when it comes to footwork because they grow up playing soccer. what do you think about that theory, and would you consider it as a training technique?
will we see you out playing soccer sometime?
you any good?
you must have been pretty pleased with the lob?
can you remember the last time where you won four tiebreaks in a row?
frightening you can remember that.
no.
can you talk about the mentality of the tiebreak? do you actually enjoy them?
you served very well today. is that the result of perhaps all the hard work in the winter you put in and you got stronger, tougher?
if you play like that tomorrow, presumably you'll be quite confident?
you have, i think, three matches in three-and-a-quarter hours. is that the kind of message you want to send out at this stage to other players?
back on your serve, what differences are there in the way you serve here compared to on clay, if any?
are you going for another practice?
do you sometimes think it's a little bit quiet out there?
at big stages of the match, do you expect the crowd to get a little bit more into it?
is there any part of your game that's not pleasing you particularly?
is this the best you've felt going into wimbledon? last year, there was a lot of doubt and you had to prove your fitness. this year you're having a great run on grass. is this the strongest you've felt?
are you able to enjoy matches like that where it's more somebody is coming forward at you, gives you a target?
what kind of an affinity do you feel with this place? in days gone by when the national training centre was in the corner over here, guys like tim and greg used to think it was almost like playing a home base. as a kid you came here a bit, didn't you? but do you still feel that feeling?
obviously pleased with that?
you couldn't have wished for the tournament to start so well for you, did you?
is there anything you weren't happy with? it looked like you were serving well, returning well on both sides?
what about mardy fish? you know him pretty well, don't you?
do you think the draw is opening up with safin and monfils pulling out?
how would you rate your game now? 75%, 80% where you want it to be?
it's quite unusual for you to go straight onto the practice court. is that a reflection that you don't feel you've had enough tennis this afternoon?
did you get a chance to see any of the doubles last night, fleming and skupsky?
you got that hibs missed out on ronaldo. (laughter.)
you did get john hughes, though.
the next match got a bit delayed by a bit of a bomb scare. were you aware of what was going on at the time?
bit of a late start. what were you told?
have any bearing at all on either of you?
pretty tough to lose a match without even facing a break point.
yesterday you were talking about it being a good test for you. what do you take away from the match?
is he a real contender now for the big one? i mean, people tend to not look beyond the big two these days. is that wrong? is andy still right in it?
you obviously know what it takes to win wimbledon. what's your kind of assessment of the kind of batting order in terms of favorites for this? would you say roger is well out in front?
what are your plans between now and wimbledon?
do you hope to be back here next year for a chance at a fifth title?
back on roger, how much of an effect do you think becoming a father might have on him in the future? and also, the fact that he's now equaled sampras' record, if he were to go on and beat it and being a father, do you think that would lessen his drive at all, his ambition?
did it change your focus at all when you became a father?
has he asked you for any advice? have you offered any advice?
having seen andy murray's development over the last few months and a couple of pretty comfortable wins here, do you fancy his chances as a real contender at wimbledon?
after your team's excellent performance in the twenty 20, any thoughts about the ashes?
do you think it improves murray's chances at wimbledon, nadal and federer aren't playing at the moment?
that was pretty impressive stuff. were you in a hurry to get back and see the football?
9 out of 10 performance?
how did you arrive here? i know you're not traveling on the tube.
the events of the french open, how much of a bearing, if anything, do you think that seems to have with a shape-up for wimbledon?
you'd expect rafa to play?
have you ever felt better coming onto the grass?
rafa and roger obviously are going into wimbledon without any competitive grass court play. i mean, how would you feel going to wimbledon without playing any grass court competition?
any chance of you going to eastbourne?
you already feeling excitement of wimbledon looming, or can you put that out of your head until you're finished with this tournament?
what do you know about garcia-lopez?
you must be pretty pleased with that after the tough time you've been having?
can you talk about what you mentioned on the tv interview about the racquet?
all your racquets?
just one?
how are you feeling on grass this year? you've had a good record here before, and you've got the game to go far.
do you think grass is best suited to your game?
and you obviously beat nadal in 2007 here. that must prove to you that you can beat the best players.
do you think you can be a threat at wimbledon?
did he just sort of take you unawares at the beginning?
next up is andy roddick. how do you see your chances?
when you say it's a good test, what are you actually meaning?
couldn't have made a better start, could you?
bit of patience in the second set before you got a break?
i saw in your twitter site that you were talking about federer's win and his place in history. can you tell me a little bit about how the players have reacted to that, that victory? is there much talk about it?
federer's victory.
i just want to know when you guys talk about it, do you talk about it in terms of -- do you have the same discussions we have in the pub about, you know, greatest-of-all-time debate?
is there a feeling amongst the players that perhaps now he's equaled pete's record and the history has been lifted off his shoulder in that sense he could take his foot off the pedal, or are people thinking now he'll be even more dangerous?
and do you think he can possibly be more dangerous now?
now he's got no real sort of pressure on his shoulders.
how about yourself? how is the grass feeling out there at the moment?
rafa has said today he's going to try and play at wimbledon. he's got tendinitis in his knees. i wondered if you ever had a similar problem and how long it might have taken you to recover.
you had a shoulder problem coming in to wimbledon a couple years ago.
what's it like when you're not sure whether you're going to be able to play or not?
do you think sometimes people perhaps who aren't involved with tennis underestimate the strain on the body playing just with the sheer regularity you guys do?
does the grass act as more of an equalizer? are you less likely to hurt yourself on a grass court than you are, say, on the hardcourts which we know now are 75, 80% of tennis these days?
do you think federer's victory in paris and nadal's condition makes him a clear or clearer favorite for wimbledon than, say, he would have looked a few weeks ago?
yeah.
you would like to see yourself master three or four, wouldn't you?
your shoulder is 100% now?
you could face lleyton hewitt in the round of 16 here. what are your thoughts about that? obviously you have quite a few queen's titles between you.
when you're playing against players like rafa and roger, slams who you have inferior records against, do you start working on specific technical elements of your game, or does it become more a psychological thing?
with roger.
do you start working on technical elements of your game to sort of improve against him, or is it sort of more psychological after a while?
was it just tough to get into that match?
is there a question of being intimidated, playing a former world no.8?
what positives are there to take from your performance today?
are you confident of getting a wildcard in wimbledon?
you talked about taking this match and learning from it. what are things you are hoping to learn from it?
is one of the hardest parts of your job these moments here, picking yourself up, not getting too down with things?
couldn't be a better way to start, could it?
you've got a great record at queen's. what's so special about playing here?
in terms of the courts, do you prefer playing here to wimbledon?
does it ever take you a few days to adjust to grass, or do you get straight back into it?
six months into the year since you came back from surgery. how would you assess yourself?
how soon did you leave paris? and when you got to london, did you get on the grass that day or the next day? and when you do get on the grass, do you go full bore straightaway or gradually work in?
what do you think of roger's achievement in paris, what he's done?
did you ever think that sampras' 14 would be matched?
as a fellow player, how do you think roger will react to this? obviously he had history on his shoulders and now that's been lifted. some may say he might sort of take his foot off the gas or he could be relaxed and really go for it and, you know, dispense of all before him. how do you see him reacting to this?
in terms of grand slams and records, do you see him getting stronger?
what did the locker room feel when people were saying his career is on a slide? surely you...
but you knew the quality despite what...
who do you think is favored for wimbledon now after the french?
do you feel you can win it again?
you've been practicing with andy murray and playing doubles. how did that come about? do you think the british public have to be patient with their expectations with him for queen's and wimbledon?
london has their masters cup this year for the first time. you played, i think i'm right, houston, shanghai, sydney, lisbon?
what do you think of coming to london? and can you sort of remember a few of your highlights from those places, obviously houston being the big one?
sydney and shanghai.
another question on roger and rafa. as someone that played rafa in paris and you've played roger throughout your career, how do they differ from an opponent's point of view?
do you find one more difficult than the other to play?
why do you choose to play here instead of halle?
question of missed chances and opportunities?
any reason for that?
you must be pretty pleased you can take the world 95 to a tiebreaker.
is that a missed opportunity for you?
is it especially disappointing coming off performing so well in nottingham?
what's it going to take, do you think, for you to get to that level where you do start taking these chances?
is it a question just trying a bit too hard?
i know you're going to improve all around, but is there still one thing you think lets you down against other players?
did you have three or four set points in that tiebreaker?
what's your immediate schedule now?
(indiscernible.)
are they announcing them today?
will you be disappointed not to get one?
you're afraid you've done enough?
is grass still your favorite surface?
he served a lot of first serves as well as aces that made it difficult for you to get into the rallies?
who is your coach?
how did you feel out there today? you seemed to move pretty well.
how big is the adjustment coming from clay to grass?
what did you make of your opponent? do you think he's got the potential to be better, move up in the world?
needed more passion, maybe?
this is a very big opportunity for the british players to get wildcards. are you surprised he didn't show more of an effort to take that opportunity?
you can feel vibes, can't you, as a player? you can feel if your opponent is not really up for it? you get the vibes from...
you get the feeling when your opponent isn't up for it, isn't so passionate maybe?
you're a wildcard yourself and you seem very focused.
getting the job done?
was it a bit of a late scheduling for your schedule?
you didn't apply for your wildcard. he approached you rather than you approached him?
you applied and he replied?
just before...
you must have been thrilled, delighted?
it's been a few years since you arrived here without many expectations. maybe it might allow you to relax and enjoy yourself and maybe go a bit further than expected?
can you explain a bit of the sort of injury you had with your back, and...
what sort of treatment did you have?
it's always big for you coming over to london, isn't it, with your following, your support?
it's okay.
what do you make of what's going on at the top end of the game at the moment with yesterday's events in paris? what did you make of federer's achievements?
do you think now that the pressure is maybe off his shoulders of -- well, he still would like to beat sampras' record, but...
well, he leveled with sampras.
so with the pressure off his shoulders, do you think he's a more dangerous opponent now?
do you see him regaining the no.1 ranking?
number six grand slam. how special is that one for you?
how much trouble were you in in the third set when you had the treatment? how did you feel then?
did it go away completely?
is there an explanation for the second serve where you seemed to have a little trouble?
it's softer maybe than usual.
some double-faults.
four.
how does this compare to the first roland garros and wimbledon?
everybody is talking about the record of pete sampras, roger coming near to it. you have now won grand slams on all kinds of surfaces and you're 22 years old. how far can you go, compared to these guys and records?
what do you think made the difference at the end of the match? was it more a physical battle or a mental battle?
you saved 13 breakpoints. i mentioned it to federer. he said, i wish i was a lefty. do you think it's an advantage to be a lefty? also, have you ever wished to be right-handed in some situations?
the first part?
after the victory of wimbledon last year and after the victory of the hard court now, i guess you proved yourself as a true king from this moment. how do you think about that?
you proved yourself as a true king.
what did rod laver say to you out on the court?
have you ever spoken to him before?
were you worried the toll of the game on friday would have on you today, or did you believe you were fit?
you played roger so many times. what did he do well against you today and what did he do not as well?
did you worry at all about the new clothes? did you worry about being able to win with the new clothes?
do you plan to offer him a revenge at the playstation?
do you think you'll be able to find sleep tonight?
can you imagine you only served four double-faults in the whole match, and sadly, in the last game, you served two?
what would you consider more surprising, the fact that you made 95 winners against the no.1 in the world, or the fact that you are 25 years old? normally players become very strong when they're 20, 21, 22, but not 25.
what do you consider more surprising of these two facts?
when you hit a great shot, and you open your palm, what do you mean by this?
what were you thinking at love-30 deep into the fifth set? did you think that was your moment, that was your chance?
about nadal having one day less to rest, don't you think that players should do something to avoid these problems all the time? at the us open they play saturday the semifinal before the final. here they play one day, then the next. don't you think you, as players, should start to do something?
only wimbledon has the perfect schedule. the others do what they want.
you had 95 winners. you played extremely offensively, but rafa still gets so many balls back. what is the most impressive thing about his defensive skills?
in the fourth set there were a couple of points early where you looked tired.
early in the fourth set you looked very tired after some points. within minutes you seemed to snap out of it and you were playing out of your skin. was there a time when you thought mentally to yourself, i just have to do anything i can to stay in the point or...
you've been involved now in two of the best matches most of us have ever seen: the wimbledon final and now this one. what was the emotion at the end of this one?
you said the other day that you never played with the best of verdasco when you beat him six times. did you expect he could play so well like he did tonight or were you a little bit surprised?
tonight he played even better, no?
how would this compare in drama and emotion to the final at wimbledon against federer, then maybe the rome match against federer a couple years ago?
what did you say to each other at the end of the match?
you're not only the no.1 in the world, but you are one of the top players in the politics of the atp. is there nothing you can do to avoid this problem of scheduling, that you have one day of rest and roger has two? apart from wimbledon, every tournament is screwed up. the us open, they do what they want. roland garros, they do what they want. here the same. don't you think the players should do something?
they play sometimes one day before the other.
how hard is it to keep up that level of intensity for over five hours?
what will you do tomorrow? what can you do to help yourself recover?
quarter to 3:00.
how exciting is it for you to finally play federer in a grand slam on hard court?
do you plan to play closer to the baseline against federer? tonight you had to run really a lot.
i saw he was able to stay farther in front.
what did you think of your game today? what went wrong in your mind?
you had a lot of breakpoint chances you didn't get today.
what is your take on the match today?
you played it.
is that a matter of experience, that he plays best on the big points?
you thought you got the maximum out of it, the maximum you could achieve?
you're happy with what you've achieved this tournament?
how do you assess rafael's chances of going on and winning the tournament?
what is better about his serve?
do you think that's the big difference from the match in madrid?
what is his biggest strength?
you're through to the semifinals without dropping a set again, like last year. can you compare your level here this year versus last year?
sounds like you're playing better. what is the difference? is it your serving? what's improved this year?
will it be very emotional to play a compatriot, fernando verdasco, in the semifinal?
will that be a good feeling for you, playing against another spanish player, someone you know well, compared to against someone you don't know very well?
you're from a hot country. how important is it going to be for players to stay out of the heat as they're going further into the tournament?
how do you think people from places that are cooler than where you come from are going to be handling the situation?
does having the roof closed or opened, the way it changes the way the court plays, is that good for your game or bad for your game?
not a satisfactory condition out there, but were you better prepared for the conditions, do you think?
what worked well for you today?
do you feel as though you're getting into position for shots, that little step quicker at the moment, and therefore able to do what you want to do rather than responding to what other players are doing?
could we expect to see an andy roddick diet book coming out soon?
what about the larry stefanki effect. obviously you've had a big difference.
you'll work through this year with him, 2009?
when did you notice that novak was starting to struggle?
you seemed to be getting up from the changeover before the umpire called time. are you trying to put a little bit of mental pressure on him?
what do you think of the rule that allows the opponent, any player, to have a massage when they feel a little bit off and delay match?
do you feel like there is a question mark of his physical durability?
in the game after you came off the break you made three double faults. was it just a rhythm thing?
how much of what you've achieved here so far is to do with the self-control that you seem to be showing out there? good or bad, it doesn't seem to matter to you. your reaction is very level and noncombustible.
how much of how you're playing and when you're playing better is four to five years of work trying to improve certain things, and how much of it is the last two months?
you already looked very confident in doha. and now, of course, again, and even more. did you go to doha knowing that because you had done all this work it was going to be a good year, or did it come with the first few matches?
how did you feel about his decision to walk off?
you've been really consistent on the tour for a number of years. been a long time since you've won a grand slam tournament. has that kept you going, improving, really wanting to win another one?
talk about your next match. set that up.
you've had the experience of the monstrous early morning finishes here. how difficult is to finish a match at 2:00 or 3:00 and then have to come back and play less than 36 hours later?
do you feel something should be done about that?
i think 2003, '05, '07, and '09 you are in the semifinal here.
what do you think about it?
you've talked about facing federer, and now it will be 18th time without playing matches on your own terms. talk about playing matches on your terms and not on his terms. talk about what exactly that would mean.
there is any phrase that larry stefanki keeps telling you that you never heard from jimmy connors?
something that surprised you?
talk about roger in the last year or so.
if it turns out being him, is this a better chance for you than it has been in the past few years?
when somebody walks off like that, does it in any way kind of deprive you of your moment?
did it make any difference for you that in the beginning of the tournament you were sort of under the radar, that everybody was talking about lots of other players. for you, inside, when you approach a tournament, any difference at all?
seemed like even when you were way off the court he was pushing you off and coming in and you were hitting the ball harder. was that deliberate, or is it just on the day that you're a little bit in the zone and you feel like you can hit whatever you want to hit?
tell us what novak said to you at the very end when he shook your hand.
were you consulted about whether it was an afternoon or night match?
you said a couple of days ago that you've never felt better coming into a january. you must feel an awful lot better now.
what about the match today tactically? did you have a particular plan in mind against him?
was the difference between the two of you just a physical one, that you were fitter?
you said in brisbane the davis cup changed you and made you believe more in yourself and your ability to win those long games. do you think that helped today?
have you ever served better? he said you served unbelievable.
looking at the statistics, there is a big difference in the average of the second serve. you hit all the time around 155, while he's 125. that can be a huge difference in the end?
did you speak with rafa about tactics?
when you played in paris in november, you got quite frustrated on court. today you didn't get frustrated at all. you kept a very even temper throughout the match. do you think that was important?
can you explain why you are playing so well and why ana ivanovic seems to have so many problems?
when you lost the first set, with your record against him, did you think, here we go?
what now? this tournament has always been dark horses going to the final. everything is open for you now?
it's going to be hot the next few days. does that worry you?
you worked with gil reyes during the off-season. can you tell us more about that?
do you hope maybe in the papers tomorrow the verdasco headlines might be slightly bigger than the nadal headlines? would that be nice?
a lot of people made andy murray before the tournament the favorite. do you think he deserved to be the favorite?
how would you rate your performance tonight?
how do you feel to be back in the quarterfinals of the australian open?
better than last year?
what is on your knee?
is there anything wrong with it?
did the fireworks affect you in any way in the third set?
how do you assess the match with fernando?
were you surprised he beat murray?
are you happy about that or would you have preferred to have played murray?
do you think this tournament favors people who aren't so experienced? you made it to the finals. verdasco is through to the quarters.
what are your emotions right now? you're in the quarterfinals, but a tough way to go through.
did you speak to him after the match?
even before he got injured, the first set was a bit of a strange match. not a lot of power; a lot of slicing, moving around. is that because you know each other's game so well?
do you worry about how that sends you into the next game? having played a match like that, will that affect your game and timing?
you must be proud to be in the quarterfinals of a grand slam, though.
will you match any of nadal/gonzlez?
do you have some specific tactics in your mind if it's nadal?
how different will you feel facing nadal again perhaps in this tournament compared to last year when you faced him here? you've changed a lot as a player. how different is your approach now mentally maybe?
you're yet to lose a set. after today's match, how far from your top are you?
was today's performance your best one of the tournament so far?
have you ever played this well in australia before? do you think this is the best you've played in australia?
how difficult is the shadow that comes across the court?
i know it's early in the year, but as the defending champion in hamburg, are you going back in july?
was it difficult playing early?
clearly you're not a hundred percent. exactly how do you feel and how did it affect you during the match?
the fact that he played well, does that take the edge off?
under the circumstances, what could you have done better maybe?
he had a lot of breakpoints, broke you a few times. how do you feel your serve went today?
he improved a lot since you played him last.
were you surprised how physically strong he was in the closing stages?
you've clearly improved your fitness a lot over the last year. do you feel you were happy with the level of fitness that you had in the fifth set?
how did you find the experience of going in with so much favoritism?
is that something you feel you have to get used to?
you talked about having concentration issues in a couple of earlier matches. was that a factor in the slow starts in a couple of the sets?
were you surprised by his consistency in the fifth set, especially on serve? when you had a chance of breaking him at 2-all, he managed to keep it going. were you surprised by that?
you said you've been sick the last couple of days. are you saying that had no impact whatsoever on today's performance?
how important was the sixth game when you had several breakpoints in the fifth set? many thought you played a bit too defensively.
you're just coming off court at the moment, but is there still anything you might learn from this?
was it a bit weird having your former coach right in your eyeline on the baseline? were you aware of brad sitting courtside?
how would you rate his forehand compared to rafael nadal's forehand?
what is your injury? what happened?
could it be related to the new racquets?
was that the first time it actually hurt?
yes.
do you know how it happened?
in the first set you were playing pretty cagey, not big shots. was that not because of your wrist but a tactical decision?
why did you switch racquets? did you have any problems adjusting to prince?
were you able to make the change quickly with no problems?
you think it gives you more power or what exactly?
this is the first time you played gilles. you're obviously close friends. did you say much to each other as you were walking out?
you were 10 meters in front of him. was it normal to have that big gap and gilles to catch up?
the top seeds struggled today except you. how did you see your match?
he's only won one set in ten meetings against you. what do you put your amazing dominance down to?
does his style of play suit your game, do you think?
overall how did you assess your tournament to this point?
you changed coaches and trimmed down and did a number of things in the season. does your tournament start now? is this where the changes sort of measure?
and marcos or novak in the next round. will you be studying that match?
can you break down the matchups?
either one of those.
for you is this a conversation match? getting back into the conversation match?
you talked about not being in the conversation. is this match --
how is the early relationship going with larry? feeling like you're gelling?
have you been on center court this tournament yet?
you think you'll get that on tuesday?
did you get the message if they do?
i was just kidding.
did you get a chance to see a bit of the end of the match?
comments on the first set?
you guys all know that berdych, if he has one of those days, he's pretty tricky, isn't he?
how about the pace of the courts here? do you think they suit or don't suit you?
there's a suggestion they're slower than they were.
you were on serena's website as one of her best all-time wins. can you clarify that for us?
so a charity rematch might be in the cards?
she thinks now she's beaten everyone you've beaten.
was it 6-4 or 6-1?
explain your relationship with legardre. are you going to be training there?
it's a commercial relationship at this point?
is there any advantage of spending just over a week on the outside courts?
or disadvantage?
do you have any history with venus?
where was that?
the national tennis center?
with rick?
clay court, bad weather, bad wind? the day you played serena.
how do you think serena will feel when you say she was lifting dump trucks?
have you ever considered switching a racquet like novak?
what are the rewards of that kind of a change?
how tough was that today?
at the end the second set, did you sit at your chair and think, surely he can't keep playing as well as he's playing? his standard was so good.
did the seventh game of the third set turn it around?
he had five game points and three shots i could have made, but not at that situation.
did you feel flat at all in the beginning or did he just make you look like that?
since the olympics, is there always a bit of a feeling that this guys goes crazy and it's going to be very, very tough?
berdych goes crazy and has a fantastic match it's going to be very tough for you or anybody.
did you see a scouting report, because he seemed to be more in control when he played stan the other night than he used to be in the past?
you were extremely satisfied to come back from two sets to love down.
what is your sense of anticipation for the second week here? i think from the neutral looking at it, it's got the makings of probably one of the most exciting second weeks of a grand slam for a long time, with the matchups and players and what have you and the levels they're reaching. do you sense that as well?
what do you think about hawk-eye?
why?
what do you think about the last six months of del potro?
you said that after three and a half hours you were still fresh and fit. there's a lot made of murray and nadal's fitness. do you feel you're as fit as these guys?
today when you were two sets down, is there a little bit of panic that comes, or do you start to ever to say to yourself, i'm in trouble?
it's always difficult to play those late night matches. how much of a relief was it to get through and win that one?
that was the toughest match so far. do you feel you're improving with each match?
these late nights are becoming something of a tradition at the australian open. what's your experience this year?
did you and marcos see and talk about how late the women's match was going when you were waiting?
what about in the quarterfinals? andy hasn't had quite the time on the court that you have. will that suit you?
when do you play, tuesday or wednesday?
i thought you know that's why i ask.
were you having problems your knee or some part of your leg?
you've been so close to beat roger federer. did you think the turning point was 3-3 in the third set and then you hit the ball into the net?
you pushed him into a very hard limit in the fourth set. did you not have enough fuel in the tank and you wanted to finish it in the fourth set?
can you talk about the hawk-eye situation in the fourth set?
you beat roger at the olympics and also won a great game in doubles in the world group. did you play roger then?
does it make you have a bit more confidence in your game, or not?
last year you came very close to win the second set, and maybe you made not such a good choice with a drop shot. this year you seemed more disciplined, just playing maybe more smart. do you have a different way of looking at the game than you had last year?
do you have any different goals this year, or things you would like to do in terms of ranking or winning a big tournament than in the past?
you called two medical timeouts there. was your physical condition a problem to the end?
did you feel sometimes that he was afraid of you? you made some nervous shots sometimes. did you feel you were getting to him?
that looked very easy. was it as easy as it looked?
do you feel that you are gathering momentum, that you're getting better with every match?
you might have andy murray in the next round. is that a match you look forward to? he's been in good form, as well.
what makes andy murray so difficult to play against?
what do you think of what roger federer and novak djokovic have said? they say they are surprised that people think andy murray is the favorite to win here. do you think he deserves to be the favorite?
you're the hottest guy in the place. you've lost no sets and only 12 games in three matches. do you suppose this momentum you've built up will serve you against andy murray?
can you remember when you ever had a streak like the one you're on at the moment? can you ever remember playing as well as you are at the moment?
are you playing anywhere near your form of last year?
what did you like about your game today?
and your back is okay?
the french men are doing very well in this tournament so far. why do you think that is?
have you been practicing together?
is there a rivalry between the four of you or do you all hope each other does well?
like to be the no.1 french player?
there has been a lot of talk at this tournament about who the favorite is. why do you feel you are in the category?
how do you feel about someone like novak, who is the defending champion, being told he's no.4, not the favorite? do you understand why he feels extra pressure?
how did you find the conditions today? was it hard down there to serve with the wind?
did you find one end was better to serve from than the other?
in the third set you managed to get a double break. his body language, throwing racquets, towels, when he got to his chair, did that give you an advantage thinking that you had him?
your next round is against gal monfils. how do you feel about coming up against him?
have you got any little subtle tricks that you might pull out to try and unsettle him?
as friends, have you practiced a lot with gal? did you play against each other in juniors?
can you remember the match when you were 12, where it was and who won?
how important is it for you to have made this stage of a grand slam just for your profile, that you can perform at the highest level?
it's been a good day for french men today. do you think one of the french men will win the australian open?
how can you explain there are four players in the same generation in france so strong - so different, but so strong? why all now?
are you surprised that tsonga was the first one to go to the final of a grand slam? did you maybe believe that gasquet had more talent and could be first or not?
in rome the surface was different, but you were a completely different player. what happened from there to now?
you know which match. i'm italian.
what do you think the difference was out there? he was too powerful? your serve let you down?
looking back at your 10 days in melbourne, what sort of lessons are you taking away?
on the television coverage, it appeared at a change of ends you were in your bag on a phone or something.
did they speak to you about that?
who was it?
who was on the phone?
from the prime minister?
was that the biggest moment of your career, when you got to the world group, beating fernando?
will you have any advice for gasquet to play gonzlez tonight? in order to win against gonzlez, what do you have to do?
with tsonga, where do you see him in the tournament?
ahead of djokovic?
why?
a slow start, but then you got into almost overdrive. how would you sum up the game?
that point, once you held serve early in the second, it seemed like you got really aggressive very quickly. was that a deliberate thing or was that just the way the match happened to turn?
at the end, was that him hitting out or were there a few nerves?
would you say, andy, the way you won today, compared with the match at the us open, would you see that as a measure of how much you've improved since then or did you feel he didn't play as well as he did then?
can you compare the start you've had here with the us open, how it feels to you?
you've had a good run against verdasco in the past. what have you made of him so far?
lively atmosphere in there tonight, lots of scots.
you said you had very good preparation for this. now you seem to be coming into form. do you think you're gaining momentum as the tournament goes on?
do you think you've been tested enough up to this point for the second week?
did you like the davis cup atmosphere or did you think the fans were a bit over the edge?
how are you feeling at the moment? take us through your emotions.
how does it rate with some of the five-set matches you've played?
do you see any similarity with the game you had at wimbledon with andy murray?
there's a lot of strong french male players this year. do you think one of your teammates has a chance to win?
which one do you think is strongest?
were you hampered by your foot during the match?
when you were leading two sets to love, were you confident you could finish it off then?
do you think you've hit many better shots than that passing shot to save a set point?
are you playing well enough to equal or better your quarterfinal appear's from last year?
how do you assess your game so far?
talk about your next match. you played him in paris in november. he got the best of you. different surface.
you recently switched your sponsor from nike to fila. can you talk about fila a little bit?
you're a designing man like venus and serena are designing women?
you want to try out some of those ideas on us?
do you feel like yourself involved in fashion when you retire?
when you play someone like tsonga, who likes the big matches and stages, do you have to match his energy level?
you've had a lot of success against andreev. how does this particular match compare to the other ones you played against him?
is this the best you played against him?
you're getting up there, you're a veteran. when you look back, you still seem pretty eager, fired up. the break in 2004 wasn't one that you consciously took. do you think that's a factor? do you think more players will be more conscious of taking larger chunks of time off on the tour?
you spoke about playing andreev on clay. you've had some success against nadal on other surfaces. how do you beat nadal on clay?
what are the two best matches you ever played drama-wise? agassi and what else?
federer?
davis cup?
when you finished your match, what were your emotions or feelings?
what memories will you take away from the australian open?
you can hear the emotion in your voice. is it hard when you realize this is coming to a completion?
i think we'll miss you here, but how much will you miss...
have you drunk the champagne yet?
you got a gift from tennis australia to go anywhere for dinner as well.
apparently it's a gift to go anywhere in melbourne for dinner for you and your people.
any ideas where?
i'm from sydney. do you want a good french restaurant?
what happened with the foot faults in the tiebreak?
it's happened to you before?
how much of an affect do you think that had on you? you won the next four points after that. did you think it ended up costing you?
do we have a chance to see you back here next year?
how does it make you feel to be saying good-bye to grand slam events?
what memories will you take away from this tournament?
that semifinal you played against federer in 2005, people still talk about that as one of the great matches. how does that stick in your mind in terms of your career?
you seem to keep your emotions in check a little bit tonight. was that a conscious effort to hold yourself back a bit?
you embraced roger at the end. was that partly because of what's happened at the tournament, or because you knew you were saying good-bye as well?
you also say he's the best you ever faced?
fabrice?
i know it's hard for you, but who is your tip to go on and win the tournament?
what about nadal?
do you feel like federer's playing the same as before or a bit different?
did you guys say anything to each other over the net?
did he say anything to you?
what would it take to change your mind about walking away from tennis?
do you know what that something else is?
rather sentimental end to a four-set victory with fabrice not coming back to australia?
what did you think of your game today?
is it a pleasure to play with an artist like fabrice santoro?
the draw has been pretty favorable for you in terms of matchups, and that's going to continue in the next round. it is important at this stage to keep up your intensity and not take anything for granted?
today marat and fabrice played probably the last matches here. can you assess who they are in the tennis, what they represent?
yeah.
when the time comes for you to make a similar decision, do you think you'll announce it at the start of the year? or do you think when you've played your last match you'll just say, that was that?
to beat him in straight sets you must feel pretty good.
how much better are you feeling this year than last year at this tournament?
could you put a percentage on how much better you're feeling?
you make it look so easy sometimes on the court. winning in three sets, do you think it acts as a bit of a warning to the rest of the field left at the australian open?
did you think your opponent feels the fact that you're confident with a straight-sets win?
did it make a difference playing in the evening session and saving your energy instead of playing out in the hot sun?
speaking to your new role as players' leader, player council, what are your thoughts on the fact that, again, there were horrible crowd scenes outside today?
is that the sort of third round match that you needed?
we just spoke to delic about the trouble outside. what are your thoughts on what happened?
when it becomes violent to the point it did, what would you say to the fans that were involved?
delic said he asked his supporters to keep it quiet and nice on his website. would you look at doing something like that as well?
the atmosphere on court seemed to be much better towards each other. the fans were enthusiastic, but not out of control. i assume you had to walk a fine line between wanting people to cheer for and you feed you a little bit of their energy.
there was allegations of a chair being thrown, and there was a scuffle outside. about twenty serbs and croats. does that disappoint that you, fans of yours are involved in that?
would you ask them to tone it down?
what do you think was the difference out there today?
he had a lot of chances on your serve. i think he only took one of them. was that more your good play?
did you learn anything at the us open last year before the roddick match with all the nonsense and after the roddick match? do you do anything in terms of trying to stay calm?
is adapting to this racquet any different from adapting to any racquet in the past?
the ball was out by so little. what did you see? you didn't see it out, in, you just took a chance?
you feel your game is where you want it to be, or do you still need to improve a lot of things at this time?
a lot of players like to play when they feel like it's them against the world. you seem to be a player who plays best when you feel like you have a lot of positive support behind you. do you feel like you're lacking a bit of that at the moment?
seemed like there was a really great spirit out there on court. are you disappointed that there was a bit od a skirmish between fans out there?
you had said on your website, hey, guys, let's calm down. will you be following that up now?
what was your message to them?
had you spoken to novak about it prior?
the atmosphere in the stadium seemed pretty good today.
quite an experience for you here. what are you going to be able to take away from this? i hope that doesn't leave a sour taste in your mouth?
does it give you a lot confidence to know that you can play a lot higher than what your ranking suggests?
did you surprise yourself how well you played?
what you described as a skirmish, do you know how many people were involved?
when you decided to play college tennis in the united states, i don't know which college you attended.
did you have offers to attend other colleges?
how do you think novak is playing and andy's chances to beat him?
you feel your week here has been touched by a bit of magic. you came through qualifying and you walked out of here with more than $50,000.
what do you feel was the difference in the match today? was it djokovic's experience, just a little luck?
the procedure for the wildcards, i know you and dancevic got in.
do you draw from the four?
the highest ranking guy?
so you knew you had a 50/50 chance?
your thoughts on today's match?
are you playing as well as you did last year when you made the fourth round?
what about the heat today?
a very different atmosphere from the second round.
what about the next round against del potro?
did you play with him in juniors?
did you beat him?
a lot of people pick him and you as two of the players who they think are going to jump up in the next year or two. is he someone that you judge your progress against?
david said after the match that he could see you being top 10, even a top-5 player, sooner rather than later. is that something you feel you have in you, or do you need to make your game a lot better before you can do that?
do you see del potro as a long-term rival, maybe a decade-long rivalry between you and him?
do you get a bit more of an edge because you're playing someone your own age, compared to ferrer today?
just in the lead-up playing another young man, 20 years of age.
can you tell us a little bit about what was hampering you on court with your injury tonight.
did you consider calling the trainer at all?
will that hamper you at all going further into the tournament?
were you at all worried when it kept going and going and going, tiebreaks, then the final set? were you worried about whether you would win or lose?
can you please tell us something about your friendship with some french guys like gal monfils, gilles simon, gasquet.
just tell us something about your friendship.
do you think your game's as good as it was last year, your form?
you must be pleased with the result that you had today and looking ahead towards the tournament, some big matches coming up, as well? the match was tight. you managed to take the match away from him. how did you manage to do that?
guccione in australia is known as a serve-and-volleyer. did you do any research beforehand on chris, how to break down his game?
did you try to do anything to combat the conditions on the court?
you've only dropped 11 games in two matches. how do you assess your form to this stage? you must be happy.
when did you feel the momentum shifting in that match?
you were able to push the no.6 seed to four sets, take one off him.
did the conditions have any affect on your serve?
what do you take out of this result?
you came in on second serves a lot. is there no other way to go? because you don't compete with a guy like that at the back court. is that how you see it?
where does this leave you in terms of your career? are you confident to move forward and beat one of these top 10 players in the next month or year or so?
is consistency the key of staying in the top 100, maybe the top 50?
is someone like simon potentially a bit of a role model or inspiration in the sense that he's 24, made this jump? you're 23.
looking at the top 100, does it change your program in the next few months in terms of your schedule of tournaments?
yes.
what is the situation with your coach?
where? here in melbourne? traveling with you?
obviously you still have your doubles coming up. what else have you been doing with your time off the court?
your girlfriend said she wants you to take her to phillip island. will you do that?
getting back to peter mcnamara, how did that come about?
is the arrangement for a few months?
is he based in europe?
are you staying in melbourne?
first time in seven years no aussie male has made it to the third round. there's talk about the young blokes doing well. how would you see this australian open? do you think it's been a disappointment that nobody has been able to crack through the next level?
does it give you hope and confidence for the davis cup coming up?
any player that shows promise gets a lot of pressure. how do you view the tomic situation? nation seems to be expecting him to win on center court at 16. how do you view that?
in your opinion, with guys like we just said, guys who show a lot of promise that have a lot of pressure on them, is there too much pressure on young australian tennis players?
what did you think of your performance tonight?
how did you find the general experience? there was a debate beforehand about whether you should be playing on rod laver?
your opponent came here and said he felt you actually settled down. did you feel pretty comfortable out there early on?
people often comment on your composure. have you always been like that?
could you sense the crowd out there?
what's next for you?
what do you take out of the experience of the two matches that you can build on and learn from?
any goals for the rest of the year?
did your dad have much to say after the match?
who do you think will win the tournament?
how badly were you hurting at the end? you looked as though you were happy that the match finished.
what was the factor, i mean, why did you win? describe how you won.
do you have in your mind the memories from three years ago when you just had your first quarterfinal in the singles?
what were your impressions of your opponent?
he said you have no chance in the next round. he would have easily won if you had played best-of-three sets. what are your comments?
were you happy with that match?
what do you feel is the difference between your play in the first set compared the second and third when you won more easily?
you're likely to have a match against roger federer if results go as expected. fond memories of playing him obviously here.
you feel at the top of your game?
2005, the semifinal when you beat roger, can you talk us through that a little bit. was that one of the best wins of your career?
you pulled out of kooyong. what was the injury? what is the state of it now?
did the doctor advise you not to play?
you and your sister both had matches. will you attend her match if you have spare time?
talking about you and federer, do you think a lot of things have changed compared to your last encounter in the australian open?
at that time you were one of the favorites here. now it's much more lower key. what are some of the big differences?
for you personally, just the experience of being here as a big name versus maybe not one of the favorites.
in every which way tonight that was a thoroughly good performance. would you agree with that?
do you worry at all that a guy who comes on like that isn't going to punch himself out or keep doing this all night?
he's now ranked 200, something like that. where do you think a guy like him belongs actually?
you gave him a pat on the back. what did you say to him?
andy, you have a lot of respect for lots of athletes. are you interested in the sport that's very popular in america, like motocross?
you have santoro next. will you expect an easier ride given that he's the oldest guy in the draw?
is there something about a new you this year? you know, you got a new coach. you look slimmer and trimmer.
thank you. and i'm neither, unfortunately.
do you feel a lot different about yourself coming into this year?
what have you gotten from larry so far, and how is working with him different from other coaches?
did you feel if he could handle marcelo rios he can handle you?
when you're playing a match against somebody that comes out really hard and fast and you might not be familiar with their game, is there ever a sense you might sacrifice a set to feel them out a bit to try and find their weaknesses?
you've learned a lot from a lot of different coaches. larry comes in. is it you who are asking questions or him saying this is what i think you needed to?
isn't there a trust level that needs to be built up, too?
you could have played kohlschreiber. now you've got fabrice who you beat pretty badly a couple months ago. does it affect you in any way?
get your thoughts on the match and how you played tonight.
did bernard surprise you a little bit early on?
so you found it difficult with the big crowd supporting tomic?
and how do you feel now about your chances now that you're through on the third round?
what's the experience been like?
what have you taken out of this? to look to the future, what do you think have to do?
what does to take for your motivation to continue in your career? i guess having won the first round match and having the crowd support today and everything.
what extent did inexperience play a part today in that match?
do you come away encouraged thinking you can be that sort of player in a few years yourself?
does what happened here this week altered your schedule?
have you got any goals, i guess for the year ahead?
if you were telling somebody how it went today, somebody that didn't watch the match, you were there. you said the unforced errors, what causes those unforced errors?
another good win today. you must be feeling good with yourself.
nice to see the chipping and charging.
is playing marat still a very exciting prospect?
do you have a preference whether it's a day or night match?
still seems a bit strange when you said "former champion like me."
former no.1. does that seem a little bit strange?
i misspoke.
does that still seem a little bit strange, to use the word "former"?
did you catch any of his match last night?
do you have any thought about the changes the atp made this year about the schedule and points system?
what do you think of ivan's sudden departure from the atp board?
what about his suggestion that you would be an ideal replacement?
have you talked here with etienne's replacement? and if so, any first impressions?
were you concerned that he wasn't european?
does he need a second in command that knows more about the professional game of tennis?
your opponent today, he kind of goes for every shot. so does that remind you of yourself maybe five years ago?
last year you said you created a monster. do you feel like that monster is still there?
how would you assess your form. you've had two straight-set wins. are you right on track?
especially your serving and returning.
just one double fault and 71%. is that the sort of level you're going to have to maintain?
are you playing as well as you did this time last year?
with roger healthy and andy playing well. coming in does did feel harder to win this year?
last year there was a lot of attention on you're imitations of other players on the court. now since you've won here last year a lot more attention seems to be focused on your game. does that make it easier or harder for you to concentrate on?
in your mind does it satisfy you that you're one of the top leading contenders for the titles that people aren't looking that sort of stuff anymore?
do you watch the other guys? will you go out and watch roger's match now?
last year everyone was talking about you as sort of the third man after rafa and roger. now it's andy as the third man. do you get that sense?
because he's the one being talked about as the third challenger.
i'm not going on the ranking system.
there's going to be a great game in spain in march, serbia versus spain. how much important is it that you have janko tipsarevic and nenad zimonjic? you think you're going to be able to upset title-holder, spain?
delic just won. is he an easier opponent for you?
in the third set were you trying to save a bit of energy toward the end or was he really putting in the effort?
looked like your back wasn't giving you any troubles today.
you're fully recovered? you feel fine?
when you come back here playing this match, do you get the same feelings you got last year?
do you feel like your run to the final last year was sort of like a breakthrough for french tennis - it made all the players think if he can do it, i can do it?
how did you play today?
must be happy with your start to the second and third sets?
what gave you the most pleasure out of that win today? what pleased you the most?
you handled the hot conditions very well.
after having such a good season last year, what did you do during the off-season to try to build on that?
seems like you're playing now the way you did the second half of last year. were you surprised at your sudden jump in results?
so many french guys are doing well at the moment. who are the players you get along with and are close with?
can you talk a little bit about their different personalities, what makes them unique?
what about you?
did you feel like you were under a lot of pressure to win that game today? did the pressure affect you?
what happened after the 5-3 lead?
then the match quickly got away from you after the first set?
was the heat a factor?
maybe because you lost the first set you went mentally down because you thought you had to play three more sets in that heat to win the match?
do you take any positives out of this match?
your nickname at the academy is project 45. do you feel there's a lot of expectation on you or that you put on yourself?
like the other guys joking around with you about it?
the nickname, is it one you take seriously or is it a bit of a joke?
what about all this media attention from your home country, does that give you extra pressure?
you enjoy it?
could you have asked for a better start? you seemed to hit your form very quickly today.
is it good to have a match that's over so quickly in the first round?
would you say the more improvement you have made is on your serve?
it was so easy. did you not feel sorry for him?
is that dangerous if you lose concentration if it's that easy?
i think he will look for another job.
he told us just now.
i notice you didn't have a sleeveless shirt on today. are you sort of getting a bit older?
i wouldn't go sleeveless myself. what do you think?
anything cause the change? was there any reason to change it up?
with roger and novak winning well, was it important for you also to send a message to them?
those straps are protection only in the knees?
it's protection?
are you a bit underwhelmed not to get a full hit out or were you quite happy to get out of the heat?
how is the court underfoot? is it really steaming?
have you been out for a hit yourself afterwards, try to do something to get more time on court, as well?
does that leave you a bit frustrated then, having an opportunity to have had a center court match?
when did you realize that he was struggling?
is it easier to play here for you as the big british hope, or is it easier to play wimbledon?
you have beaten djokovic, rafael nadal twice, roger federer three times in a row. do these matches put you in a situation where you have a lot of pressure because you came here maybe the favorite player to win the slam?
where do you think you've improved since we saw you here last 12 months ago?
following the us open final, coming so hot into this one, do you notice there's a different attitude to you from other players in the locker room? are they looking at you differently? do you get any vibes like that?
ever finish anyone's career for them before?
does the role of tennis' grim reaper sit easily with you then?
he was playing his 39th grand slam. do you feel any compassion for someone who finishes after a long career like that?
what will you do the next couple of days? how do you prepare for the next one?
are you a good sleeper?
do you enjoy the fact you're actually in the center of the tour right now? you're most talked about, maybe even more than federer, nadal, and djokovic.
do you feel you're equipped to cope with it over a two-week period?
on the heat, you've always done pretty well when it's hot. do you actually like it when it gets hot because you feel you can handle it better than others?
in days gone by you used to wear a cap indoors, outdoors, day, night, whatever. on a scalding day like today, you didn't have one on. what was your thinking?
some people are saying you could be no.1 during this year. are you thinking of that? is there any extra pressure?
midway through the fifth set, a switch in momentum. what do you attribute that to in fernando lifting his game a bit, yours going off a bit?
is this the toughest loss in your career?
was your recent lack of match play a factor?
did fernando's injury break throw you at all?
you pushed him pretty close. he's a very good player. is this discouraging for you with your comeback or encouraging? does it give you hope you can get back to where you were?
where do you go now?
no matter what happens from here, do you feel you've written yourself into the history of this tournament by having so many great matches?
any sense that it's your last australian open?
where do you feel you are at the moment as far as getting back into the top 10?
how did your body hold up? your first five-set match in months.
you said during the week that it would be nice to have someone else take a bit of the burden of expectation off you that you've had for a long time. bernard tomic in the last 24 hours is all over the front pages. do you think that might help you as you come back, not having as much pressure on you?
do you see similarities in the expectations that are on him now and were on you at a similar age?
(question regarding the surgery and thoughts of retirement.)
did you have any input as to whether this was a day or night match?
will you take bernard under your wing if he approaches you to hit with him on tour?
how would you rate fernando's chance in the tournament?
(question about his left leg.)
how tough are the next few months going to be now? your ranking is going to drop a bit. you won't have the protection of the seeding any more.
will we see you in the doubles here?
this is a close match. you've had a lot of dramatic matches here. what are some of the most memorable ones for you looking back?
must be a good feeling to be back on the winning streak after five years.
have you been able to put your finger on why you found it difficult to win here in the past?
did you get a sense early you were coping better with the conditions better than he was?
you're confident you can go on with it now?
past 12 months he's made some giant leaps as well.
do you have to change your service action at all on a windy day like today?
a crucial point in the second game of the second set. did it bounce twice there or was he just saying things?
you're the type of player that would concede the point or leave it to the umpire?
you worked really hard here over summer in practice. you've always had the big serve. did you work on anything else in particular?
your movement looked really good. i was wondering whether you'd worked on that at all.
you're certain you're getting better? do you feel you're getting better?
a lot of the australians tend to play on margaret court and have been successful there. wayne arthurs used to like playing there. something particular about that court that suits the local players?
it's open to the elements, obviously. days like today make it a bit more difficult.
how do you approach simon? do you think you'll have an underdog factor. is the pressure on him?
you mentioned a good start being vital to your game.
is that a satisfying opening round for you today?
was there any point where you thought it might go another couple of sets?
there's some tough competitors coming up if you continue to go this way. what do you think of your chances throughout the rest of the open?
anything you feel you need to improve on for the next round?
coming up in just a few hours, barack obama's inauguration, does that have any significance to you, being african american?
will you be watching at 4 a.m.?
you said you helped with the campaign. what did you do?
what does it mean to you to be the youngest winner here in a match?
you were quite emotional at the end tonight.
how were the nerves today?
the crowd was so loud. did you feel any pressure at any stage from them?
you seemed mentally strong. where has that come in the last year?
how important was the hit up with rafa nadal for you?
talk about your next match. muller was out there for five and a half hours. is that encouraging for you?
what don't you like about it?
how are you feeling? spent a long time out there for yourself.
i think you said about a month ago you were struggling with your fitness. what have you done in the last month?
did you see brydan won as well?
have you played in sunglasses before?
it's something you've become used to?
do you think starace showed your backhand enough respect?
it's been a good day for australian tennis after the criticism its had. do you think the criticism has been fair?
with the winning, do you feel there is good stocks in australian tennis coming through?
how about the prospects of possibly playing on rod laver arena?
you look and play as if you're very cool on an extremely hot day. are you as cool inside as you seem to be?
been a lot of pressure on you as australia's next great hope. you handled that well today. are you ready to continue coping with that sort of pressure?
what were you feeling in the fourth set when you had two set points?
how do you feel about the pressure, being in your home slam and that sort of stuff?
do you enjoy that type of pressure? thrive on it?
ten unforced errors in a first-round match. have to be pretty happy with that.
what do you take out of a match like that looking forward?
since you were here last year, do we see any changes in your style of play?
can you say it's aggressive but simple at the same time?
it's because of your new coach, this little change?
next up is malisse. your thoughts on that?
how dangerous can he be?
are you surprised to see him back?
you won in less than two hours. how important is it to conserve energy in the early rounds?
do you think that will help in the later rounds the fact you had a quicker first-round match?
looks like you're back to the breadsticks. are you carrying less weight?
how much? you look trimmer.
i don't know. this time last year.
we've seen in the last 18 months a bracket of younger players emerging to challenge roger. people talk about the big four, and you're not in that. do you feel you still belong in that top group?
confident you can still beat those players regularly?
taylor dent is back. have you been in touch with him? what are your thoughts?
have you had any chance to work out with him?
what do you think of moving the tournament to february?
you've been no.1. you won a grand slam. you've been here for a few years. is it sometimes difficult to keep motivation? is it a reason why you may have changed coach?
larry has been pretty specific about the adjustments he'd like to see you make in your game. how easy is it to do that during a match as opposed to practice?
if you could help adam helfant prioritize things when he comes into the job, are there a few things you'd like to see him look at first?
can you say what some of those issues were?
do you have any theories on why this tournament produces more one-off finalists than others?
what would be a big year for you this year? what would be an okay year?
how much time did you actually take off during the off-season other than recuperating from the ankle injury?
just bringing it back to today's match. obviously you had a pretty quiet lead-up. how did it feel to be back out on court? you look a little bit drained. i'm not sure if that's the heat.
how did you feel out on court?
your second-round match on wednesday is a pretty big day back in the u.s. with the whole obama things. any plan to get up early and keep an eye on how things are producing pver there?
lance armstrong is over here. are you surprised by the australian media attention? i'm not sure if you've met him. you probably have. are you surprised by the attention he's getting over here?
one of the things your coach has said is that he is anxious for you to improve your balance on your approaches to the net and you can become a more effective volleyer. is that a sound reasoning?
do you think you're getting better at it?
are you surprised that the arizona cardinals beat the philadelphia eagles?
on that level with lance and everything, a lot of tennis tournaments bring in a lot of different celebrities, like even boyd tinsley. is that kind of fun for you when the celebrities come and watch?
miami maybe?
how difficult was it tonight? you played with him four times. you were 7-6, 7-6 in monte-carlo. in dubai a fight. how was tonight?
you said something important on the court today, that you watched the sunset. that kind of mental relief made you seem more hungry in the tournament. you look different but in a good way.
what happened last year was different. after this mental rest, we have the roger federer that was in 2004, '5, '6, or am i wrong?
seppi had 10 breakpoints during the match. do you think he's fragile in those moments, afraid to do something, less aggressive, or it's you that became more aggressive?
when you called the hawk-eye, did you feel the ball was out?
yes.
moya and ferrero, former no.1 players, lost today in the first round. does that surprise you? can you imagine where they find the motivation to keep going and playing?
you mentioned korolev. that's going to be a tough matchup next time.
do you feel like it's kind of a match that really got you into the tournament?
you had a particularly good stretch the last five games of the first set. what does it feel like whenever you get in a zone like that?
do you get back to south africa these days, either privately or for the foundation?
do you still have a plot of land?
do you feel more confident now than before you won the us open last year?
right now. do you feel more confident than when you won the us open last year, before you won the us open last year?
was that a satisfying start to the tournament for you or did you feel a bit unsettled, particularly in the third set?
did you get tired in the third?
what happened in the third?
was heat the factor?
a new experience for you coming into a grand slam defending a title. were you nervous thinking up to it?
in general, had you be thinking about this in the weeks leading up to it?
there's been a lot said about your change of racquets. has that had anything to do with some indifferent form leading up to here?
can you afford to do that in an open?
jelena talked about how you guys are setting tradition for tennis in serbia, where a lot of the players are coming from a country that already has a rich tradition. is that something that's special to you, that you think about at all?
obviously you're defending champion. how does your form at this point stack up compared with last year at the same position?
what do you think about opinions of moving the tournament to february?
after the masters, you got four or five weeks to rest and train, am i correct?
you've taken a leadership role on the tour, as has roger and rafa. now that there's a new head, what are a few of the things you'd like to see adam helfant take up and change?
what are your thoughts on the match?
you've played here a little bit. is that some of the toughest you've experienced here?
anything in particular that you found hard or different?
the conditions.
you escaped a pretty tight one, then?
how was your serving today?
you say this is the third toughest conditions you've played in. what was the first toughest?
you always have the crowd, the loyal supporters. how much do they bring to it?
it seemed you were concentrated just on winning one set to guarantee the first place, not to face federer tomorrow. it seemed you stopped fighting in the final set. is it true?
are you sure?
they are discussing the round robin system. what is your opinion about that? is it complicated for the ones that don't pass? what is your opinion?
what do you think about your match against del potro tomorrow?
what do you remember about the last match against juan martin del potro and what do you have to do to win tomorrow?
can you describe your feelings to be the first swede in the semis since a long time? does it prove to yourself that you belong amongst the very top players in the world?
we don't know that much about yourself outside the competition. can you tell us about yourself, your hobbies. looks likes you like watches?
after the three tough matches, how are you about your physical shape?
how would you describe your performance today compared to your first two matches.
how disappointing is it to come to london and not win a match?
you requested the trainer during the second set. what was the problem with your back?
in what way do you feel a part of soderling's success this year? first paris that started off his climb to the top and now here in london.
is this a tournament you want to forget or will you use it for the davis cup, as fernando also lost three matches?
what do you plan to work on in order to get the confidence back for next season after the davis cup?
how do you feel before the davis cup finals? are you confident enough after this tournament?
until a few months ago, everyone was always talking about you as a very powerful player, a player capable of always playing close to the baseline.
attacking from the baseline was your game. very deep, in general, very powerful. now sometimes they are saying you don't seem that powerful anymore.
you need to recharge?
what is your feeling about it, apart from the batteries? do you think you have lost a little strength somewhere?
back to the davis cup final. who is the best player, stepanek or berdych?
how much more do you feel you need to go up in your game to be totally satisfied with the way you're playing?
what do you think about the masters rules? do you like this tournament? is there something you don't like?
you can lose the first set 6-0, but you can win the two others. with this round robin, it's becoming very important to win every game. will that make you change, or tennis is tennis?
you keep tell us you're dead tired, you cannot play anymore, but yet you keep winning. how can you do that?
you're in a very difficult position now. obviously you have to wait and see what happens in the other match. will you have enough time to prepare for federer tomorrow if you learn at midnight tonight you will be playing tomorrow at 2 p.m.?
bearing in mind what you were saying a little earlier about the schedule you've had this year, do you intend to make any changes to your schedule next year?
regarding the davis cup final, the two top spanish guys look out of form. do you think the czech republic has a chance against spain?
you're still tired, obviously. you're answering the questions tonight intelligently and eloquently as you normally do. that wasn't the case two days ago.
accepted.
the beginning of the tournament you said you had breathing problems, didn't know quite what it was. in the second match you said you had some kind of injury. what was your status today?
last year you got to the final in shanghai against djokovic. djokovic is out. do you think it's fair, the round robin system?
you played roger many times. you've lost many times. do you really believe that you can win?
a question on your tactics. you talked about how you were trying to volley more. you did that successfully today. is that something you would like to try against roger, to go to the net more?
you are 18-5 in tiebreaks this year. very consistent.
what were your thoughts when he missed the easy forehand on match point?
what do you think djokovic thought when he missed that easy forehand?
do you think he's glad about that or not?
you have to play your semifinal in 15 hours. do you think you have enough time to recover physically?
there's been a lot of confusion about the qualification process, even in here until the last few minutes. how much did you know going into the match about what you had to do and how difficult is it to play under those circumstances?
there was some suggestion you spoke to gerry armstrong in the third set. was that some clarification?
how tough is it playing a guy like verdasco? kind of a license to just swing freely today. that presumably made life a lot more difficult.
with the prize money at stake, the number of people coming to watch these matches, how unsatisfactory is it that we're at the stage where people are not quite sure who goes through under what permutation?
12 months ago you won your last group match. took you three hours. the effort of that seemed to cost you the next day in the semifinals. if you go through, do you feel having an extra day tomorrow will help you and you'll be in good shape for the semis?
overall how would you rate the week so far, your three performances?
how do you feel physically after these three matches?
do you think nadal has a small crisis? what do you think about his game now?
your initial thoughts on tonight's match with federer and del potro? will you be staying to watch the game?
can i ask you about the time ruling out there. there wasn't a changeover where you didn't go out there and have to wait a fair amount of time on the baseline for fernando to come out. before the match, you were kept waiting. do you have any thoughts that maybe these rules should be tightened up a little bit at the moment?
did it get to you at all out there tonight?
fernando verdasco has fared quite well in all the games he has played. did his game surprise you to some extent, because he was quite consistent?
you sometimes say your own name when you're annoyed. is that something you've taught yourself to say instead of swearing?
you only won one breakpoint out of 13. i appreciate he hit some big shots on those 13 points, but did you come up short a bit in some of the big points, do you think?
you said your game was good enough up to now. is there something you wish to do or have to do better if you're in the semis, if you want to win the tournament?
you've experienced many strange things in your varied career, but being two points from going out and a round robin qualification decided by one game, how curious is that in terms of curiosity?
are you aware during a match like that of all the mathematical probabilities and possibilities that are going on or do you just play the match without knowing or taking that onboard at all?
i'd like to know, after winning the second set, you had the knowledge that by winning one game in the third you were qualified for the semifinal?
you didn't?
the end of the match was quite confusing. juan martin was left on the court for some time.
waiting to find out who he'd qualified.
obviously you didn't know about that.
what do you think about the qualification system in general? it's obviously been very confusing tonight for at least one of the players. andy murray also tweeted that he was confused waiting for the result to come through.
through to the semis, do you prefer one of the three guys that you can face?
you said you know del potro could raise his game. to which level? are you surprised how good he could play? do you think he could be better, something more?
you had those three break points at 3-all. at the start of the following game, he had the lucky net cord that put you down love-15. did you have a bit of a mental letdown after having missed those three break points and then the net cord?
do you feel sorry for the spectators who didn't know at the end of the game who had qualified? there must have been thousands of people who didn't know murray was out, that del potro was through? maybe some of them didn't know you were through. do you feel sorry for the spectators who paid money to watch you tonight?
mats wilander said before the tournament that you were able to be in the semifinals here. how do you feel about that?
you coming in as an alternate, not expecting to be here in the first place, is the feeling different to a tournament where you are the top speed or playing at home and there's a lot of expectations on you? do you feel your game is reacting differently under those circumstances?
the other day you were asked about denmark winning the world cup in 1992. i don't remember if you said you didn't remember.
you will have to see it now.
you've had some pretty big results this year. where would you rate what you've achieved at this tournament amongst the results you've had in 2009?
if you had to choose one player not to face in the semifinals, who would it be?
in the past when i've seen you play, you've always seemed quite an emotional person on the court. occasionally you lose your temper if it doesn't go well for you. you seem really in control of your emotions for this week, and you have for a number of months. has something happened specifically the way you approach the game?
you may not remember '92 in denmark, but in '95, wayne ferreira came to the atp masters as an alternate and he beat kafelnikov, he beat sampras, then he lost by an inch three sets to becker. did you know that story?
he said he was so relaxed. he was almost going hunting in south africa when he was called at the last minute, went to frankfurt and played well. were you relaxed, too? do you think that helps, that you have nothing to lose, this strange situation, or not?
the last swede to play at least three matches at a season-ending tournament was your coach in 2000. you've emulated a few things he achieved in his career. did he give you advice as to what to expect in this tournament, because it's unlike any other tournament through the year?
which facet do you think you improved in your game to make these huge results?
yes, aspect, the one you improved on most this year to record these results.
it's obviously been a very grueling few weeks for you. did that rather show up today? running on empty a little bit, perhaps?
how tired are you?
do you believe you can pick yourself up and be ready for your nadal match?
do you think the late finish you had against davydenko affected you today?
thinking about this year, which do you think you played too much? was your tournament too much? which moment of the season was too much for you?
is it only fatigue of the year or is it something special today?
it's something you've discussed at length. i know it's difficult now, but in terms of calendar, you're in a position of responsibility on the tour.
how well did soderling play today? are you surprised how impressively he's come into this tournament?
how happy are you right now with that victory?
you started very well. what happened towards the end of the second set? you looked a bit tired. was it the breathing problem or something else?
what do you think about your first set? perhaps rafa was not so good at that moment or it was a good performance from you?
one of the things you did very well in the match was coming to the net. was that your tactic?
you said you have a little injury. what is it and are you worried for the next match?
i was looking at your last few years and realized that you ranked no.5 or above in every one of the last four years. do you feel you've had the respect for those finishes?
from everybody. do you think you get the respect you deserve for somebody who has finished in the top five for four years in a row?
you're a helluva player, better than most people think. you don't have a racquet endorsement. do you think people should respect you more as a player, as the great player you are, also sponsorship-wise?
how come prince does not sponsor you any more?
you were up a break twice in the second set, nadal managed to fight back each time. the momentum was shifting towards nadal. the crowd was getting behind him going into the tiebreaker. how did you manage to keep your mental focus in the tiebreaker on the important points?
was the first serve the big problem for you tonight?
what was the exchange you had with the umpire around 5-2 in the second set?
asked him?
how do you read your situation now qualification-wise for the weekend?
this is a low-bouncing court. does that suit you? you were making more errors than you usually do at the end.
your thoughts on your next match? you have a decent record against him, haven't you?
was that one of the best roger's played against you, last couple sets?
were you aware of the crowd out there tonight? did the atmosphere feel different to your first-round match?
were you surprised how even-handed they were?
how much do you think your lack of matches affected the way you played today, the six-week layoff?
now the match with verdasco becomes more important. this is the round robin. last year you won the three matches. it's not a defeat like in another kind of tournament.
this is a new venue for the atp world finals. do you hope it gets a new audience for tennis in britain?
did you have a back injury of some description?
how much does finishing no.1 mean to you, considering you weren't no.1 at the end of last year?
today andy didn't feel that he played well. what did you think of the quality of the match today?
do you think del potro can jeopardize your qualification like he did in the us open final?
you've been nominated for an athlete of the decade award along with lance armstrong and tiger woods. who do you consider to be the greatest athlete of the last decade in any sport? how would you make a case for yourself to win the award?
the fact you won this match, having lost the first set against murray, is that a particularly encouraging aspect for you or don't you think it matters that much?
at what time do you like to play your next match, in the evening or in the beginning of the day?
what do you prefer to play?
you play at night.
were you at all surprised how even-handed the crowd were in their support for both players tonight? it didn't sound like a particularly partisan crowd in murray's favor.
do you think in any way the round robin system gives you an unfair advantage on thursday in that you and juan martin playing second would know exactly what you need to do to get through?
could you explain your strategy to choose to receive serve to start the match.
since you almost qualified for the semifinals, what do you think in group b, who is playing his best tennis right now, and who would pose the greatest threat to you?
yes.
what do you like particularly about playing nadal?
do you know the denmark team of soccer that won the european championship? they arrived expecting holiday, because they wasn't supposed to play. they substitute yugoslavia, and then they won the european championship.
yes. do you think it will be the same history for you: instead of holidays, win the masters?
how did you feel you served? what can you say about nadal's game today?
what did you think when rafa came back at 3-all in the first set?
there were a lot of very close, tense games at the end of both sets. you held your nerve. is that something you've improved this year?
do you expect a gift from roger federer? you almost saved his first place at the end of the year.
when you consider what happened in paris, with the victory for yourself, the history between the two of you, when you get to play rafa, do you get even more up than for any other player?
to hit so many clean winners against a great retriever like rafa, that must give you great confidence going into the rest of the tournament?
were you surprised at the errors he made on the set point and then the match point? did you think you'd have to hit winners to take those?
straight sets today, but a close match. do you think the loss was more to how you played or how he played?
what do you feel you're lacking at the moment? it's more confidence or technical problems?
what do you think of soderling's chances on this surface during this tournament?
you're speaking as if you were not thinking anymore of no.1. is it true?
how did the court feel today?
you said you lacked a bit of calm. physically are you a hundred percent back after the injury problems?
by the sounds of it, you'd be quite happy to see the end of this year, 2009, and get started for 2010. is that the way you're feeling?
what went wrong today for you?
no.
besides those reasons, do you think soderling is now a player that doesn't fit so well to your game, because you lost the last two matches against him?
i know it wasn't a particularly happy experience, the match today. what do you think of the conditions in the stadium, the support of the british crowd?
did you think about the match you played at roland garros at all today? did that make you want to beat him any more?
really long battle, hard battle. how would you describe your performance?
did you have a physical problem going into the match or was it during the match?
what was the key point for you today to be able to win after such a bad start?
are you surprised by soderling's win over rafa, and what do you think of your next game against him?
is you serving confidence? physically you're not well?
can you talk about your physical trainer.
what kind of match do you think it's going to be against soderling? it feels like you have an advantage against him, you're 5-0 against him.
after such a long and hard match, you lose. but this is still a round robin. how do you feel about this fact?
you were in control of the match for quite a long time. what happened at 4-all in the second?
what was the problem? why did you call for the doctor?
who do you think is the toughest player in your group? is it rafa, soderling, or djokovic?
what's the game plan for wednesday's match? what do you have to do in order to win that match?
even though you haven't had time to think about it, you've already seen him play since he came back from his injury. have you seen anything different, any new weakness, something you can attack that he didn't have before the injury?
was it your idea to swap shirts or novak djokovic at the end of the match?
you were in control of that match for a long time, then it changed in the second set. describe what happened in that game, what you remember about that game.
did you feel more nervous in those two games at 5-all and 6-5?
obviously a good start for you. what was it like out there today?
you picked it up a bit. how tough was that? he had won six out of seven games.
how did that atmosphere compare to queen's and wimbledon? somewhere between the two?
how did it feel to be out there?
the round robin obviously adds a different element to any other week in the year. how important is it to get that first one under the belt, get off to a winning start in this kind of championship?
were you particularly pleased today with your defensive backhand? had to stay in the rallies quite a lot today against his clubbing forehands. that shot was particularly good today, i thought.
did you travel here by boat today?
is there an element when he kind of gets on a bit of a roll with that forehand that you just have to kind of tell yourself to soak it up and weather the storm?
what do you think of soderling as a person and what kind of relationship do you have with him? do you have any relationship with him?
you said you couldn't see the crowd while you were playing. is that off-putting in any way? different to other stadiums in the world?
did you feel the home support particularly during the match today?
very different to wimbledon?
is there more pressure for you here than when you play at wimbledon?
no?
how do you feel today?
were you aware of the reason for del potro's timeout at 3-love in the first set? you took a walk to the back end of the court.
what were your thoughts on the other group matches you'll be facing?
i saw the video with you on top of the roof of the arena. how was it?
a kind of symbol of your ambition to go on the top of the roof of the tennis ranking?
do you know who you're playing tuesday yet?
do you have any preferences to who you play next?
so do you prefer generally playing at night or...
did you think it would be a bit louder in there today? it seemed fairly quiet until the third set.
how did you find the court conditions tonight and the playing surface?
playing surface itself?
what did you have to do tonight to turn things around?
the match, the way it was going.
compared to paris, what about the speed of the court? is it normal or quicker?
did you feel on court that fernando was using different tactics or different combinations since he's here with darren cahill, who actually worked with you for a while?
what do you think about the latest stories about agassi?
admitting taking drugs.
what type of match are you expecting against andy on tuesday? what can you remember about your match in china last year?
are you satisfied?
given that you had a very tight schedule from marseilles to here, and then a very difficult semifinal, was it fighting qualities which got you to this title more than anything?
do you think you played well today?
he kept coming back at you, as well, didn't he? whenever you looked like moving away from him, he fought back.
has something happened to you, the ace?
is this going to help you for the davis cup, even if it's not on hard court?
how quickly can you get there, novak? are you going to try to get out tonight?
outside of the obvious career highlights of the australian open and the shanghai victory, where does this one rank amongst your successes?
how would you assess the first two months of this year, for you, and how significant is this title in the context of those first two months?
this is your first tournament victory of 2009, and your next tournament, you're going to be the defending champion at indian wells. this must give you some confidence going into that event.
considering that there are a lot of injuries to the top players, do you feel the field is going to be the same?
you said that you were getting criticism after the australian open, a few days back in the press conference; do you think you are now trying to prove something to everyone?
after this win, how far off your top form do you think you now are?
when you arrived here and rafa and roger weren't here, did you think the tournament was yours for the taking?
do you feel exhausted?
was it a very tiring match?
but you had the break in the final set, and you had the momentum. did you not feel at that point that probably you were going to win the match?
so would you describe it as your worst performance of the four?
did you feel that you were the stronger player physically in that final set?
don't you think you're being a bit hard on yourself? i thought you played quite well most of the match.
so if you were not playing well, and you took the match to almost three hours, then djokovic couldn't have been playing very well, either.
how does this performance compare with shanghai? in that match, also, it went to five-all in the third set, and again, you lost it.
some of the top players in the world are not here because of injuries, and it's only february; what are your thoughts on this?
he did play well, didn't he?
he did play well.
you had a lot of chances in the second set.
the fact that you couldn't play andy murray and you had that day off, did that kind of affect you?
and what is it about his game that you don't like?
but you beat him the last time you played him.
that was quite an easy workout for you. were you quite surprised at how easy it was for you?
what do you think was the best part of your game?
is that the best match this year?
and tomorrow you're going to play novak. any thoughts about that?
do you feel too tired to play in the double now, or are you fine?
do you feel a little bit lucky to get out of that one?
the third set, coming from a break down like that, how did you keep up that sense of belief?
he was unhappy with his game today, and he made the suggestion that you were both below par, you both didn't rise to the occasion. what's your view of that?
so if you put it on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your performance?
moving on to the final, it's going to be in darkness; do you prefer it that way?
were you wilting out there in the intense heat?
were you wilting, were you tiring badly?
gilles, somebody had to bring to an end the fabrice story of dubai, and it happened to be you. is there a tinge of sadness about doing that?
have you learnt from him during the years?
how tough was the weather out there today? there was a lot of fuss when we all in australia a few weeks ago. was it like that?
that wasn't really hot today?
here.
am i right in saying you played all three of your matches during the day here?
is that what you're thinking?
but it's a fact that it's easier to play -- it's not so difficult to play at night as it is during the day, is it?
are you happy to play early again tomorrow then if selected to?
i don't know. but would you be happy to go out first again tomorrow?
two o'clock and seven o'clock.
that's the usual.
murray.
so is that a problem or is that okay?
are you pleased with your performance today? because once you had won that first set, you were pretty dominant for the rest of the match.
do you never wear a hat when it's that hot?
there's a good chance you'll make your davis cup debut next week. how much are you looking forward to that?
it seemed very, very warm out there. was it almost getting up to australia standards?
what are your emotions after your last match?
do you remember what influenced you to come here the first year?
do you remember what influenced you to come here the first time?
is there one memory, apart from the year that you won under extraordinary circumstances, is there one other memory that stands out?
did it take you a long time to recover from that final, the exertion that you must have given in play?
yes, while you were sick.
but it didn't take you sort of weeks to recover?
it was just four or five days?
you said on court that you had been here 17 years in a row; is that true?
because i've only got you down for 12 appearances in the main draw. did you only play doubles some years?
so you've had 12 appearances.
i was going to ask you to reflect on the very first final. you reflected on your victory here, but what about the very first final which you lost, what was the atmosphere like then compared to what it was like now?
and you've watched the tournament grow over the last 17 years.
how much different is it now in terms of status and appeal?
what are some of the ingredients or some of the factors that you have put together to create your unique style? i mean, was it your imagination, or was it working out tactics or your father's influence? what creates this very unusual way of playing?
so it was an instinctive thing?
you mentioned that dubai is special. what exactly do you feel emotionally? what's your feeling?
you have been traveling around the world for a very, very long time now. i mean, do you just want to go stay at home or are you still going to travel a little bit? what countries do you want to go to?
do you have any ideas what you're going to do?
coaching?
what do you feel you have given to the game, your contribution?
just coming back to the heat factor, how different is it playing a match out there today in the afternoon sun to playing a match at night?
so therefore, is it fair that gilles has played all his matches in the afternoon and all of the top two seeds have played all their matches at night?
can i just ask, is it a fact that you are going to bow out of paris bercy?
that won't change?
how do you see the future of french tennis, because so many young, talented players have come up.
did you hear yesterday that in england, the playoffs, there was a match that lasted longer than your match against arnaud? it was just a playoff to get on to the davis cup team, but it lasted ten minutes longer than your match with arnaud?
chris eaton, he got through quallies at wimbledon last year and played one match, and he played a guy called james ward.
21-19 in the fifth.
but it's not a record.
when did you get it, andy?
were you not feeling good during the match yesterday?
does that date back to -- was it before your match against granollers?
what about the invitation for next week?
have you spoken to flossie at all?
will you be influenced at all by what happened last time in glasgow when you tried playing and it was pretty difficult for you, and it was questionable whether that was the right decision or not under?
you were forced to stay a few days longer than you wanted to in australia because of the flying thing. did you have any sort of big checkups when you got back to london?
without getting too specific, how does it manifest itself? is it stomach or aches?
your legs and your arms?
so that flu-y feeling?
the ankle problem that you spoke about early in the week, has that went away now? is that clear?
and how about flying, because you could not fly home straightaway from oz?
so you'll go back to london?
well played. your thoughts on the match?
do you guys train at the same club in valencia?
he trains there. do you train together with him sometimes?
your thoughts now; do you hope to do better this time?
because murray has withdrawn --
-- do you think it will be easier for you now?
it will be easier to reach the final?
were you surprised to hear that murray had retired?
because he started, doing very well, and, suddenly, (snapping fingers), gone.
do you feel that your hard court game has improved over the years, since you spent your whole junior career on clay. did you change anything to play well on hard?
do you think your game is for all types of courts, because you won on grass, also, last year.
and how do you feel going into the doubles match tonight?
it took you 53 minutes out there to do the job. you must be very pleased with the efficient way you handled it.
were you surprised at how comfortable it was for you?
this is a big day for france: they have five players in the last 16 of a 32-man draw. you've been responsible for the resurgence of your country's fortunes. what are your reflections on the way it's turned for your nation over the last year or so?
so you are taking inspiration from each other?
and it's much better to have the group of you competing at this level than just one flying the flag on his own.
and you're proud to be no.1 in your country?
nothing much wrong with that, was there, andy?
got one match under your belt, and in the second one; is that the reason?
how is the ankle?
did you have something on it today?
on both, support?
he's not quite the player that beat you twice on the american hard court, is he? he was making quite a few errors today, but all the same, i'm sure you're glad to have won it in straight sets.
looking to the next match, would you say that your wimbledon match against gasquet last year was the biggest turning point in the year for you?
can i ask you about the events of roehampton, have you heard what happened? some match, isn't it?
seven hours, it was.
just on that subject, i know you're primarily focused on this week, but just looking ahead to next week, how good is it going to be, obviously you don't get back to scotland as much as you'd like probably, so how much are you looking forward to a rare appearance there?
are you expecting a pretty good turnout?
have you ever been to another event there?
who did you see?
is there any shots that you don't play, or is that logistically not going to be possible with his schedule?
well played.
what are your thoughts on the match overall, the quality of the match?
did you preplan at five-all to do that?
what do you remember of playing andy at wimbledon last year? you could potentially play andy here. what do you remember?
do you think there's any particular reason why he's done so well in the past six months?
and you were no.7 in the world. how hard is it to stay at that level, because getting there is one thing; staying there is something else.
do you feel a little bit lucky to get out of that match?
that was hard work, wasn't it? i suppose you were not expecting such a test from someone ranked so low.
why was it so tough today?
with the likes of, say, federer and nadal not here this week, obviously it gives you a great opportunity of perhaps winning a big tournament like dubai, does that put any added pressure on you when you go out on the court?
can it help you to have a long match, because you've got plenty of practice in the conditions?
how do you see razzano's performance here in dubai?
what can you do to do the same or more?
what were you most pleased about in the big improvement that you made last year?
was it mental or what was it?
so was that something from growing older, or was it some psychology which you learnt deliberately?
do you have to work at getting that tudor does it just happen without you realizing?
how do you see the french tennis for the game nowadays?
as first-round matches go, that was up there with the best of them, wasn't it, really? that was as high a first-round quality match as you could hope for.
how do you prepare to play marat safin?
when you have a potentially tough first-round encounter, how much confidence does that give you going ahead?
was your serve your biggest weapon, your most productive shot?
what are your goals for this year? what would you like to achieve this year?
do you think it's helped you, there's been a lot of expectation are you in france; has it helped you a lot that simon and santoro have had such a good tournament?
but do you find there is less attention?
apart from the mental aspects, what areas of your game do you feel like you still need to improve?
your thoughts on the match?
is it tougher to switch from indoors to out, or go outdoors to in?
what did you think when you heard that federer and nadal were not playing here? did you feel disappointed that you could not test yourself against them?
most of us have not seen you since australia. what happened in the aftermath of that? how were you after that, and what did you do to sort of pick yourself up again?
but you're okay physically?
you spoke about, obviously, tonight, struggling to find your rhythm. is there a sense sometimes that in the first round, you actually prefer a three-set match so you just get more court time?
with all of the pressure and expectation that you've experienced over the past 12 months, are you enjoying this game quite as much as you once did?
how are the tournament preparations coming on for belgrade, with your family running it?
what sort of field have you got?
what sort of field have you got? what players have you got?
you're seeded no.1. if seedings go to form, could you place andy in the final on saturday. if that happens, how would you feel about that?
they are talking about the dream final to see seed one versus seed two.
how impressed are you with the way andy is playing, two titles this season already?
next week in spain, davis cup, is it a big, big favorite or just a favorite?
coming back to today's match, were you happy with your first serve? you missed a lot of first serves.
when there was a doubt about this tournament, the question was that you would get a visa; were you consulted by the atp about this?
this is a frequent question, but is this really going to be your last season?
you'll miss dubai, won't you?
you'll miss dubai. you've been here over a period of 17 years.
is it going to be a difficult year going to places you know that you won't go back to?
there will be places you won't go back to; which place would you miss most?
you said you want to do something else. do you have any plans, as yet?
do you think you will still be in tennis?
how difficult was it? maybe it wasn't difficult at all. i don't know.
did you get the sense that he let the conditions dictate to him and you did not let the conditions dictate to you?
were these the toughest conditions you've played in, or has there been somewhere that's been worse?
centre court?
you said you felt you had good strategy today to deal with the conditions, what was the strategy to deal with the conditions?
do you feel that the nalbandian match helped you find a new momentum?
you don't feel mentally stronger after that match?
tursunov.
i know you've answered this before, but why would you think winning the grand slam would be almost impossible, given that you've won roland garros four times and wimbledon, the australian on hard courts. you've won this twice. is it because the year is so long, or are you just being modest that you think it's impossible for anybody?
you've been playing so well here, davis cup, australia, wins over the top players. what are the one or two elements in your game that are really helping you play so well and have so many victories this season?
anything in your game that you think you're really improving?
because andy had beaten you twice before, was it even more satisfying to get this win so it didn't become -- you know how players sometimes build up momentum. was that satisfying for you, as well, this win?
you seem to play every point as if it were an adventure, like something new and fun.
i didn't mean you're not serious.
you seem to be playing very well right now. are there any areas of your game that you need improvement, or are there any special areas that you're looking at to improve right now?
you mentioned on the court this is one of your favorite places to come on the tour. why is that so?
how much time do you give yourself to enjoy a win like this? is it just a night, or do you think about it? or it's just straight back to work for miami next week?
on your clay court schedule, did you consider maybe not playing four tournaments going into roland garros and not playing barcelona or something like that? maybe not playing monte-carlo?
are your fingers blistered?
so you want to break it down, the singles match, or is it kind of far back in the memory?
you got in the breaker, though. i mean, he served for it at 5-4, huh?
you have the mini break at 2-1 and couple back in there, from what i remember.
oh, that's right, he did. yeah, he got one low on you, and then a backhand crosscourt.
did you ever feel like you had momentum, because he was serving for the match and you were able to break.
what's the difference between playing him on a slow hardcourt and then you last played him on clay in spain? what's the playing difference?
it's tough to rush the net on him, to state the obvious, right?
a few of the approaches were landing short, but even so, especially to his forehand side, looks like he can pretty much get at anything.
just in general, your history, you've done pretty well: three semifinals here. how do you feel about playing in this tournament? you've been pretty close.
i know you've talked about the surface. do you feel like you're getting closer to maybe winning this one time?
how do you feel this week, this tournament, helped your tennis this year? how do you feel where you're at with your tennis now this time of year? feeling pretty good about how you're playing?
you want to break down the final tomorrow?
how do you think the wind will affect that match? it's supposed to kick up even more tomorrow.
as slow hardcourts go, how does this rank? is this about as hard a hardcourt as you play on?
you took such a terrible tumble there. did you feel that the match was over at that point possibly?
after that particular fall, he then went into a bit of a trance and you were almost able to dominate the match from there on in.
two years ago when you played tommy haas, you took a fall down a set and you came back and won. can you just talk about that? seemed like a couple times when you kind of hurt yourself you've come back and played stronger, at least here you have.
it seems like against roger now you're playing on your terms. you're pretty much in control of the entire match if you're playing at your top level, which is a pretty tough thing to do against him. talk a little bit about that.
there was a lot of anticipation toward a federer/nadal final. how does it feel to ruin those plans?
are you still practicing bikram yoga, and how much do you attribute your fitness and focus to this?
that's six times out of eight you've gotten a piece of roger. how would you rate your all-round performance today?
can you talk about playing the finals tomorrow and facing either andy or rafa?
when you were a kid, were you the fastest kid in your school?
federer had a reputation for being very strong in third sets. you've taken him four times. his level was going up and down quite a lot today. were you surprised to see that?
at 2-1, 15-all, andy took a tumble. you checked to see that he was okay, and then three points later you're walking off broken. you don't win another game. what happened?
it was very, very early, of course, but when you had that love-40 game, did that just set the stage for what was going on?
do you recall struggling that much with your backhand in a long time?
how disappointed? are you disappointed? what's the mood? what's the feel?
what makes him difficult?
when he did go down, though, did you think he was hurt? and after that, did he just play better, or did you just...
that was a turning point?
it's four times now that you've played him at one set all and come away behind in three-set matches. what makes the difference?
you brought up that you were old. do you feel the age factor?
does the heat have an effect on you?
you seem to specialize in dethroning this guy.
we've talked a lot about the weight loss, but do you feel faster on the court?
is there kind of a different approach to your game? what do you think you did well that helped you beat novak so well today?
last year before this tournament you were dubai, and you got both novak and nadal back to back in that desert. now you have them back to back again. does that ring any kind of bells or anything like that?
i know you probably talked about it before. i missed it. can you talk about your decisions on not defending your title at dubai?
just how long it took for you to come up with your decision to not play?
what's the key to you playing well on this kind of slow hard court?
are you enjoying playing doubles? you played well yesterday.
i didn't see today, but you won.
will you do much of it, you think?
what about the opportunity of winning the doubles title here?
what about the opportunity of playing bob and mike in the finals?
all week long, you look like you're really on top of everything and very energetic and enthusiastic, quick movements. i was watching your turnaround. is that true? are you feeling like you're moving better than you've moved in a long time?
did you have any sense of what was going on with djokovic out there? did you have any feel for what was happening to him? did you spot anything early in the match? did he seem listless or anything like that?
no, i don't know either.
so how do you feel about the prospect of facing nadal? do you feel you can do some damage in that match?
when you played novak in new york and australia, you attacked a lot more. today was it a different strategy, or were you just feeling your way throughout the match and thinking, i can play pretty steady?
can you take us back to your recollections of your semifinal match against rafa two years ago here?
you win 6-2, 6-4, and then you go back out and practice hard. are you not happy with your game?
do you feel your level today was better than it was against nalbandian?
how satisfying was it to win in two sets today after your battle against nalbandian in the previous round?
you look like you lowered your toss to further out in front and your serve looks a lot better. have you improved it a lot?
you don't want it?
in tennis history, the sport seems to have been more popular when there have been great rivalries such as mcenroe and brg, mcenroe and connors, sampras and agassi. do you feel that you're bringing the game back to that kind of level and does it excite you?
i'm asking if you're excited by it and does it...
can you talk about the match tomorrow against andy, and have you had a chance to watch him?
can you also take us back to your match against andy in 2007?
when you go in to play andy, you've won four out of the six that you've played against him. do the past matches mean anything when you play him this time?
what are you happy about in your game right now, and what do you feel like you really need to improve during the next match and maybe for the final?
i'm surprised to see you eating cookies. are they chocolate chip cookies?
i was wondering if you have things like that quite a bit? i always think athletes have a very regimented diet and don't indulge.
better mental preparation?
andy was too tough today. what was wrong with your game and why this loss?
usually we see you play with a lot of emotion. today none of that.
after you lost the first set, was there something that you tried to adjust in the second set to try and regain the momentum?
you're obviously very down and disappointed. when was the last time you ever felt like that on a tennis court?
novak, incredibly hot day. could you talk about the heat, please.
you travel with the pr, and i was wondering, is that something that you really need, a buffer? how does it help you traveling with a pr?
you're still chasing rafa and roger at the top. you have andy coming up from below. can you talk a little bit about the past you've had with andy? you both almost came to the top 10 at the same time. you got there first. talk about that a little bit.
on a similar theme, you're going to lose some ranking points here, and andy will gain some. do you think it's going to be close between you two this year for the no.3 spot?
can you talk through the bad luck start? can you talk through the challenge business and why you were upset?
i've never known that before, have you?
are you thinking about a little bit more serious steps about this, how would you proceed about this?
the point was replayed, right?
why would andy murray even challenge that?
in the second set tiebreak, do you think the way he served made the big difference?
i know it's always difficult to talk about the money, but it did cost you money at this point, you know? can you talk about that? and, as well, how does it equal with stopping in a way when you were raising up right now at this point in your career, going up, and then this happens?
how was your level compared to your match with gasquet, would you say?
you had a great tournament in australia. then you got hurt and had to take some time off. what were your expectations coming into this tournament?
do you have a different level of belief now when you go on court against someone like federer where you say, yes, i have the weapons to win this match?
it's the left ankle, isn't it?
how did you do it?
did you have to adjust your game in your last two matches in australia because of the injury?
since australia, have you been in touch with gil reyes or with andre?
and if andre said, hey, i think i'm going to come back to the atp tour, what do you think he would rank?
did you play some practice sets with him? did you have any results?
but he's still got it?
you talked in australia about what andre said to you in december. so when you came back to las vegas this time and he saw your great result, what are some of the things he had to say to you about that?
gil and andre are so close, and gil has had such an influence on andre, do you think they sometimes think or talk in a somewhat similar way?
where did you find it in yourself to save those match points?
what about his backhand gives you trouble or was making you think...
is it safe to say during the change in the second set when the crowd was cheering for you, kind of bounced out, and was that kind of a turning point in your mind?
what did you mean when you say you are not the good mentality on the beginning of the match? what was the problem?
what about coming back for the next match? and is this a little bit like australia with verdasco and then going into the final?
2:48.
look ahead to play the next match.
do you think that the two matches that you played yesterday, the doubles and the singles, had anything to do with this?
did you expect him to quit?
how pleased are you with your response to losing a serve as early as you did?
are you surprised with how routine your progress has been because you haven't been challenged?
how do you see the draw shaping up? i don't believe you've played andreev before?
and then of course the possibility of federer in the semifinals. it's warming up now, isn't it?
you feel in good shape after that, three hours, six minutes?
how did you manage to get out of it? he was hitting big forehands.
you seem to have rediscovered your form again. what's changed?
it's just confidence?
you turn 30 tomorrow, don't you?
you played this long match and now you have to go out there tomorrow and play a guy who got a default?
you're not totally tired and wiped out right now?
did you save four match points?
five?
how about the controversy calls or no calls at all?
do you think there's some officials or umpires who want to have a sense of control in the match?
roger is going to be a father, and you're well used to the difficulties of that.
the difficulties of traveling and things like that, what would your advice be to him?
how difficult is it?
lots of people think the burden or the things that come with it might affect his tennis.
but in your case, your wife travels with you. is she going to other tournaments?
so this is wild speculation, but let's say mirka is due the last week of roland garros, last week of the center court all england club. just go and go bedside to see the birth, i presume. what are your thoughts on that?
some players, after they get an unfortunate call, disintegrate. you did not. do you have a system for trying to recover after you get a bad break like that?
murray has improved obviously in the last six months. in your eyes, how? and are you surprised to the intent to which he's improved since august?
i'd like to go back to your friend roger. the very striking moment at the awards ceremony in melbourne, some said when he teared up if athletes should control themselves and it was not appropriate. others felt it was touching and revealed his human side. what were your thoughts about that?
you spent some time working on your back in dubai, but have you tried to make any technical adjustments to your serve at all?
no, your serve. have you made any technical adjustments to your serve because of your back?
comparing last year, how confident are you on the masters series level of tennis?
this is a bit of an old topic, so apologies for asking. i haven't had a chance to ask you about it. in melbourne at the final ceremony, many people felt your emotions were really poignant. they revealed the human side. touched a lot of people. my understanding is you told swiss television that it was embarrassing. what are your thoughts about that moment? do you think it revealed something special, or what was it? was it embarrassing?
it was a reflection of how much you cared and how much you care for the game?
you were talking i think on the court about how you got some rhythm. some players give you rhythm. some players take it away. is that correct, or is that a basis for how well you might do in some tournaments if you play the wrong guys early?
was that fun today? because watching it was a lot of fun. it was great shot-making from both ends of the court.
yeah.
change subjects. i understand you like other sports, as well. can you tell me a little bit about your liking for cricket, where it came from and what you've seen?
do you watch it during wimbledon?
i think this year is england/australia.
as far as playing under a roof at wimbledon, are you looking forward to it? do you think it will change the play significantly? do you have any idea?
he's a formidable opponent. in the interview after the match, you said that you had some luck. what was the main component that you put into the game that prevailed in this match?
have you had a match end like that with a camera making the decision?
hawk-eye is your friend?
do you feel like sometimes you have to push yourself to play more offense?
when do you know that you're playing well? what things in your game clicks in a way that makes you feel like you're there?
do you feel like you're playing at a level to win this tournament yet?
you gained an awful lot of information in a very few years. is your association using you to pass on this good data to young players in serbia coming up?
i'm talking about tennis-wise?
looking ahead to playing andy. what are your thoughts on that?
you said serbia lives for tennis. can you give us the one or maybe two most incredible examples of this?
and did the president or prime minister have any kind words?
what makes roddick such a tough opponent? obviously he's been at the top of the game and he has a big serve. is it more about the way he's willing to fight than anything else?
do you feel like you are, match in and match out, now playing more consistently at a high level than in the beginning of the year when we saw some ups and downs, or are you still sort of struggling to find a high level all the time?
your sister said that she seldom goes into an interview where your name isn't brought up. do you often get questions about your sister in your interviews, or is it a one way?
can you just give us your thoughts about how things went today in your match against isner?
what happened on the point when the ball was flat?
yes. did that ever happen to you before?
you have said this will be your last year, i guess. is that still what you're sticking to?
how tough is his serve?
can you talk a little bit about your struggles here?
i just meant about playing in this tournament over the years.
if i could just ask you a question about nadal. when he first came on the tour, he's always been very comfortable on clay. has it surprised you how he's been able to develop his game on the other surfaces as well and become such a dominant player on the other surfaces?
he's also defending champion at the next two slams. would you say he has any chance given the level of competition?
what about the us open?
over your career, you've played a lot of fabulous players: rafa, federer, sampras. not breaking it down surface by surface, but overall, who do you think the best player you've ever played is?
he's just 22. do you think in a number of years we could be talking about him breaking...
how did he get into his brain?
you've had some wonderful highs and pretty big lows. do you know why?
where does that rank in your brief career?
did it occur to you that you sent him away from this tournament for good? he's retiring.
i made your day, didn't i?
i know you reached the washington final, but this might be your best tournament ever with monfils and safin back to back.
the broken ball thing, were you aware that that was a rule?
did you think when you saw him whiff it that there was something strange there?
kind of depressing, though, because that gets you to break point.
you guys hit it so much you broke the ball?
how did you manage avoiding the natural letdown after beating monfils getting on court today?
can you elaborate on serving smarter? just in terms of location?
as soon as he couldn't return your kick serve by closing on it he backed way off, and then you served and volleyed, correct?
pretty early success when you first came on the tour. obviously guys don't know your game and don't know you. what kind of adjustments do you have to make after you've been on tour for a while to sort of get back into that kind of a groove?
were your practice habits not up to snuff when you came out of college?
can you talk about to what degree you think it's an advantage to be really, really tall, and to what degree is it a problem?
does it ever go through your head, hey, i wish i were shorter? and what do you think is the best height for a player these days is?
so if you had to pick a height, what do you think would be the best out there?
go to your next match against del potro. he beat you last year in washington.
looking ahead to your next match.
has your fitness improved a lot since you became a pro?
do you think that the high performance program in the united states is on track? and if not, do you have any suggestions for them?
yes.
simple question: do you feel like you have to live at the net to have a very successful career, or do you think you can do some damage from the back, too?
are you still in pretty close contact with manny diaz, and what kind of advice does he give?
greatest thing about him as a coach or as a friend?
so how did you feel about your performance today?
i don't ask this question with any disrespect, but all of us in our lives, we look back at things and say, hey, i could have handled that differently. do you have any thoughts about that night with andy at the open and the crowd and how you handled that?
well, let me just follow up by taking a different approach. do you enjoy playing in the united states?
when you threw the racquet, was it just frustration, you didn't want to play the third set, or you thought that you may be losing control of the match?
let me bring you forward now with roddick to australia, where the match before you played him you finally appeared to hit a very good level. you play a good first set, excellent tiebreak, and then physically things got away from you. just think about that time period and how disappointing it was, not being able to finish there.
you've talked a little bit about your racquets this week again. sorry if this has been asked already, but why did you change them when you were doing so well in the first place? what was the reservation?
who did you work with at head? did you go to austria? and what aspects of the racquet did you...
when you say you're disappointed at times when you didn't take advantage of opportunities, what system do you use to get back to the state of mind where you're off of that disappointment?
futuristic question. what's your vision for the tennis tournament that your family owns now in serbia and its development? how do you see it?
do you think you'll get better scheduling for your matches there than in australia? (laughter.)
with your next match, how many points do you have to lift your game to the next round?
are you completely comfortable now on tour? are you still finding that it's a learning experience for you? that not just on court, but there's a lot of things you have to go through before you fulfill your potential overall?
you must be pretty happy with that, aren't you?
the extra day off give you a bit more time to feel good? how was the recovery?
you're obviously not finding the early morning starts too bad. three in a row, first match, and you've been right on the button?
you said that realistically you don't consider yourself as title contender here. with every passing round with the way you're playing, you must feel that more confident that you can reach the business end of the tournament?
court surface and speed to your liking here?
i asked roger historically players who finally get to the top, they bring everybody else's game up. you're one of those that's kept rising and coming up. normally the person that's at the top has to make another jump to stay one notch ahead. he wasn't sure that was accurate. how do you feel about that? does he have to make another jump up or can he be no.1 the way he's playing?
so you think he can turn that around and be no.1 again?
with a couple of games under your belt now, are you beginning to feel like things are moving in the right direction, getting a sense of touch and everything coming neatly into place?
a little different outcome than in cincinnati. what was the difference in dealing with his serve?
could you focus on the serve itself, not defending the serve but the stroke itself? who has the toughest serve you've ever faced in your career?
this is despite the ability of pete to have such a great variety of placement and great disguise on his serve, even still, karlovic is just...
when you played those hard-serving croats, ljubicic, karlovic and ancic and cilic, do you make any adjustment in your game if so? and if not, is there any difference between them?
when you began that match the court was partially in shadow. when you finished it was full in shadow. does that make it more difficult to pick up his serve?
your record in tiebreakers is phenomenal. psychologically, do you think in a tiebreaker you get stronger psychologically and your opponent gets weaker, or both?
if i'm correct, you're playing a lighter schedule this year, is that right, in terms of number of tournaments?
right. but you're starting rome for the clay court season; is that right?
looks like you're playing a lighter schedule. how much of that is a nod to try to stay fresh for the big events or a nod to your age and how your body is holding up? what are the decisions going into that?
when your back acted up keeping you out of davis cup, was that quite a disappointment? you might have won the davis cup this year.
is this particularly difficult, relative to what happened in china?
did you ever sit with him and chat about it later?
he didn't approach you and say anything?
okay. what really changed things between the first and second set with the dramatic score difference?
he's beaten you seven times in a row. you won the first three and then he wins seven.
11-9.
you said you've been thinking a lot of positive thoughts. obviously you have your health, you have a tremendous family, you're lucky to be a touring pro in this great game. what are some of your other positive thoughts you're going to be thinking about?
you were articulate about what you said in china, and you got a lot of worldwide positive feedback from that. i assume you still feel the same way about what happened.
davis cup last weekend, does it take much out of you?
feeling physically okay?
with the clay season coming fairly soon, will you feel a little bit more pressure going into miami to get a deep run there?
i know a loss is a loss, but when you lose early in a place where you had success the year before, is it more disappointing, or...
what do you think was the biggest difference today?
and playing him so close time-wise, did that really play in, you know, to the psyche a little bit for him and for you?
is there a concerted effort among the top singles players now to play more doubles? we have rafa, federer, yourself, andy...
a solid opponent, solid match. what is the confidence level at this point comparing to last year? it is even higher, do you think?
when you say that you didn't start the year exactly the way you'd like and now you've lifted things, about how many spots do you think you've lifted it in the last month and a half?
you mentioned that your fitness is getting better. what is your fitness routine currently? because i was very impressed watching you in the last match just now.
what about next round? how do you feel?
from your perspective, what do you think are the biggest weaknesses of roger federer and rafael nadal, since you're obviously in the best position to challenge both of them?
i heard after davis cup you had quite a taxi ride from gatwick to heathrow.
last year you left indian wells as the champion having been the australian open champion, and you might well have thought that by the end of the year you'd be challenging for the no.1 spot if not no.2. didn't happen. what has to change this year so that you will make it happen?
as you just said, you're 21, but it's amazing when you look at a family owning a tournament, you are planning to get to the top, you have a shop in belgrade, a clothing line, being on the late night show, so much in such a short period of time. is that part of the game now? what is it?
how do you think you played?
did you try and play on his backhand? he was making a lot of mistakes. did you think that was his weak point?
when you know you're not 100%, do you change your strategy as to how you're going to play matches?
were you especially pleased with the backhand crosscourt to take you to set point in the first set?
you feel good after that?
when someone has been playing as long as you have or any top pro and you have to take a few weeks off, how rusty do you really get?
do you think wimbledon will be the same when they put the roof over?
in terms the atmosphere, which is of course so special there, to have that court with the roof, how do you think that'll affect things?
what do you make of the idea of there really being a big four in tennis and as to whether or not there's a big gap between yourself and the other three guys and the rest of the field, or do you think that guys like tsonga and verdasco or maybe a roddick are a lot closer than they're given credit for?
you were very close during that match many times. what made the difference at the end?
you say you're very happy when you succeeded to hit backhand down the line. do you feel your backhand down the line could have been a little bit better, more efficient?
obviously two finals on the clay. you feel you're obviously going okay building up to roland garros?
you were asked yesterday about the no.3 ranking and whether or not you cared that if you lost today you would probably lose it. do you care now that it's fixed?
even though you don't even win a set today, do you feel closer today than in monte-carlo, or you were closer in monte-carlo?
the wind also?
is there a sense that he almost makes you try too hard and perhaps try shots that you wouldn't necessarily try against somebody else?
there is a new atp tournament in belgrade starting tomorrow. how important is that for you?
nadal never asked for a wildcard, but he could still play?
how did it get away from you after the rain delay, if that's the case?
if you compare with the match in miami, are you more dissatisfied by this match, or the same feeling?
you had some problems with your backhand, and you made a lot of backhand errors towards the end of the game.
would you actually like to play nadal on clay before you get to paris? i know you can't do it here. it can only happen once more, and that's in madrid. would prefer to go in to paris having tested yourself against him on clay, or does it not matter?
from the stands it seemed that the second and third set when you lost your serve you rushed a little bit in these games. is that the feeling you have, or is it something else?
how will you prepare now? will you go italy someplace, or back to switzerland?
you said at the start of the week that you thought getting to the semifinal would be kind of satisfactory. you might have an idea where your game is. with the circumstances today, is that kind of a disappointment now that you haven't gone all the way and gone to tomorrow?
you think we would have seen a different match if it wasn't raining? not to find an excuse; you don't need that.
how important do you think it was, that game that you played just before the rain delay, to get the momentum going for you again and then you could build on that after you came back?
what things were you distracted by in the first set?
roger said that the biggest difference he feels in comparing to the past is that his serve is not working quite as well as it used to. could you confirm that?
what will you draw on, do you think, from your performance against nadal - we believe it will be nadal - in the final from monte-carlo? for a long time you were his equal out there.
you feel much more stronger physically since miami?
you work much more, or...
you also be defending the no.3 position tomorrow. does that give you extra pressure or motivation?
what do you like tomorrow in your way to play in this tournament?
what do you like more in your way to play during this tournament?
what's the best thing in your play during rome?
again, today's match, do you think that everything depends from your game that improve after the stop, or you feel that roger a little bit down in his game?
last night's match was a very physical match. coming back again to play today, how tough is that to play another match so soon after last night?
the second set your errors came from concentration or a bit tired, or what do you think was the reason?
you do play some remarkable tennis when you're breakpoints down. you seem to reserve some of your best play for when you're in the biggest trouble.
does it concentrate the mind, do you think?
it depends you play fernando?
it's more difficult to play against a left-hander?
was it a matter of getting used to the first set and him and then opening it up in the second, or was it more than that?
is your level rising at the rate you want it to and you're pretty much where you want it to be, or still more to go?
another boy of '87 like novak and murray, and another left-hander. do you think he's another left-hander like verdasco and murray, they're increasing left-handers, or it's a normal situation?
do you think there's less pressure on you when you player on clay now than before, in last years?
the djokovic semifinal, are you looking forward to that after miami?
you hit 20 winners today in two sets. do you feel you're timing and seeing the ball particularly well at this moment?
yesterday you said you are playing better this year than last year. what are you doing better this year?
could you comment on your changes to your fitness routine over the last week. i know you switched fitness coaches as well. is that a result of the match in australia earlier in the year?
i don't know if conditioning was a factor in melbourne. i know you were trying to make adjustments before roland garros.
did you watch any of the first set of federer?
what do you expect? he seems to be winning at the moment. what do you expect for a new match with him?
how you play on clay changes tactically the match?
is it easier in a way to play federer than nadal on clay? i don't say easier, but you can understand what i mean.
does it make any difference to be the champion of the tournament when you go back the next year? does it feel any different, or you completely more or less forget?
did you feel any cold out there, or when you run you don't even notice?
the beginning of the match, the first two or three games, it looked like it was going to be a really slugfest from the back of the court, and then suddenly you just ran away with it. what happened in between the first two games and the rest of the match?
it was a great match with verdasco at the australian open. do you think that here can be somehow repeated even if it's best-of-three and different surface, or the clay helps you much more than it helps verdasco?
is it slightly ominous that the top three seeds had very convincing victories today, more so than anybody else? does it look like you three should be in the semifinals at the business end?
last year, you had more difficulty with his serve and net play last year. this year you dealt a lot better with it. what was the difference between you for the two games?
my question was about the same roger. i have been beaten so many times on this court when i was young player. when you walk into the court and you have close to you the guy that beat you the previous year, what passes through your mind? you're thinking about that, or you try to forget?
you played a couple of eccentric players in your first two matches here, players who it's difficult probably to get a really rhythm against. having said that, do you feel as though you're striking the ball in the manner that you'd like to be after two matches here?
you mentioned gilles simon. he's a player who's had some success against you. what's been difficult about playing him for you in the past?
did you wait for francesco totti or ilary riasi to see you?
when your first serve percentage was as low as it was in the first set, is there any conscious effort you can take, or just hope it gets better?
in rome, were you more unhappy when you lost to mantilla when you were strongly favored, or when you lost to nadal and you had two match points? what was the most painful defeat between the two in your mind and that you recall afterwards?
a lot of people write a lot of things and say a lot of things on tv programs about you and your career and your form. do you listen to them or read it, or do you completely ignore it and get on with your own thing and let other people worry about what they talk about and write about?
okay.
it was pretty comprehensive. how did you feel out there today?
was it easier than you expected then?
is there any coincidence in the fact that since we started talking to you about the no.3 race you seem to have clicked into gear and found your game?
it's a very long season, the clay court season. is there a time in it when you think, i've done enough and got my game where i want it to be and i can afford to have a little bit of a relaxation period, or do you have to have a good level all the time?
and how hard is that, to keep up and maintain a very high, consistent level all the time?
it was a strange match. very different types of sets. after you won the first one, in what way did your game go off?
in terms of your performances this year so far, how would you rate today, assess today?
any particular lessons that you take from today?
you talk about the different conditions. we thought that this kind of clay was more suitable to your game because it's a little faster. instead it wasn't.
what was the issue with the racquet? seemed as though you were struggling to get the tension right.
we were trying to remember the last time that you were foot faulted. can you remember when?
when there's a lot of the clay on the line, don't you think that's a little bit of a harsh call at that stage of the match?
good solid effort for you. any complaints about that match? no problems?
which is the biggest difference between this surface and monte-carlo?
just a follow-up to that. how did you find the court today? obviously it's taken quite a hammering over the last couple days.
after a match like this that you finish so early, what are you doing now in rome? what is your schedule in rome today?
are you feeling stronger maybe this week than perhaps you were at monte-carlo because of what you did last week?
it's just tennis, or do you think it's a specific reason why today ferrer, murray, davydenko lost?
obviously a slow start today. took a while to get into the game. just explain sort of the first set and a bit, because he was in control.
did you feel a swing in momentum or a point in the game where you thought, this is mine to win?
would it be the concentration in the second set that changed the course of the match?
what would you say about the conditions?
what happened? really slow start out there?
is it because of the condition, because of the wind, or because of the...
tougher time on the clay this season. lost in houston, as well.
what would you say about the state of the american chances coming into the clay season with you not doing so well and roddick taking some time off here?
can you talk a little bit about what this does for your confidence heading into the australian open?
is it helpful in some ways to have had a tough match? was it a good thing maybe that you were forced to fight?
you've been very consistent at the grand slams. everyone's waiting for you to actually breakthrough and win a slam. is there any reason you can put your finger on why you haven't managed to win a slam yet?
i know.
are you close to your best, or do you think you have to improve a little or a lot to win the australian open?
i would like to know were you at any moment thinking that you may lose to mr. nieminen?
were you surprised that he played so well?
that second set, the tiebreaker, you probably lost it more than he won it? is that a fair point? he seems very nervous.
the timing of the australian open would seem to favor players who do a lot of fitness work over the christmas period. were you training hard, or did you manage to get any time off this year?
what are your expectations for the rest of the year after this tournament?
will you be ready for people in the corridors of the australian open asking you how you did it?
how much homework did you do on his game?
did you go out with a premeditated plan to attack his forehand, or did you detect it during the match?
you mentioned his confidence. were you surprised at the lack of confidence?
this is your ninth atp final, but you've only won one so far. what do you have to do to beat david nalbandian tomorrow?
beating djokovic, where do you rank that in terms of your career wins? is that your best, do you think?
it's a pretty good lead into melbourne, isn't it?
what does "sisu" mean?
you served very well today. you must be happy with that.
and the conditions, much better than yesterday for you?
what did you think of the shot that gasquet did when you did a perfect lob and he hit it through the legs?
so how do you feel about your opponents for tomorrow, either one? does it matter?
does it bother you day or night, or same playing conditions for you?
what's been the most pleasing thing of your week here in sydney as far as your game is concerned?
you had a chance to look an australian open draw?
you played him recently, or met him?
what kind of improvements have you seen out of djokovic the last couple years?
do you think he's playing a little more aggressively than he did when he first came on because he's more experienced in certain shots?
how will you prepare for tomorrow?
you're a very experienced player. what motivation do you use at the start of each season? we're right in the first quarter of the year. what do you sort of set yourself for the year? do you change each year what your thinking is?
will we see you back next year in sydney at the medibank international?
is it better preparation than, say, kooyong, an exhibition, or does it not really matter as long as you're on that surface?
do you get the same excitement going into a grand slam that you did when you were younger?
you still passionate about your game?
just your general feelings on the match.
you had a shot at no.2 today. did that make the loss a little bit tougher?
what were your thoughts going into the tiebreaker?
besides the break points, anything that just didn't work for you today?
people are always going to bring up the racquet now. like every time you have a loss they're going bring up the racquet. still no problem adjusting with your racquet?
so what are your general feelings going in now? you've had a couple weeks of play. is your game where you want it to be?
had your family at the australian open last year. are they going to come this year?
you had a chance to look at your draw?
how are your confidence levels after a match like that going melbourne?
it has to be a completely different feeling now going into a grand slam defending it for the first time. just talk about that.
other than just finding your rhythm in your game, are there any other things you have to do? do you feel like when you get there you have to play more aggressive, solid? what are you looking for?
do you favor this concept of pushing the australian open two weeks later in the year? it's been brought up by a couple guys.
after everything the players went through the last couple years trying to get a new schedule for 2009, can you imagine going back and trying to get a new calendar all over again?
novak, forgive me i just arrived early today. you've met with adam helfant personally, the atp executive.
he came to see you?
what impressed you about him?
you said yesterday that you thought the back was okay. what changed between yesterday and today?
did you speak to a doctor or physio, or just your own feeling?
is the australian open any risk at all, or is this a precaution for the australian open?
so you still expect to play in the australian open?
what's the nature of the injury? just a muscular thing or something serious?
so how difficult is this in terms of your preparation, missing a match and then not being able to train for two days? will you be able to walk, hit up? what do you think you'll be able to do for the next two days?
is this one of the most serious injuries you've had?
that looked like another step up for you in difficult conditions out there.
how do you assess your form against david today?
you're pleased that managed to stick in there?
three days in row you're played off the back of perth, so probably nice to have a break now.
do you see yourself as now being ready for five sets?
the draw tomorrow, it's the first time in a real long time you haven't been seeded in a grand slam. what are your thoughts about that?
what does it tell you about your form when you get so close to beating a bloke that's ranked 11th in the world?
semifinals last week and semifinals this week.
is it too soon to make comparisons between brisbane and sydney?
i know very little about jeremy. tell me a little bit about him.
how would you compare your form this time with your previous form in the australian tournaments?
what are you doing better now?
the match out on the court now is your next opponent. give us a view of what either opponent is for you tomorrow.
nice to get that one out of way tonight?
was it frustrating waiting through the long rain delay?
it was a serbia/croatia match. what do you think of the crowd's behavior?
at the end the january there is an auction, a charity of your memorabilia. can you tell us about it.
so that was quick.
how is your back feeling?
did you consider pulling out?
so it's not a concern for the australian open? is the injury a concern for you leading into the open?
how do you find the conditions out there?
yeah?
you don't mind the heat?
why do you enjoy the heat or like the heat, playing in the heat?
your serve was very good today, yes? 87%.
is that as good as you hope it to be next week?
is that as good as it is ever?
started off well today. what happened?
you seemed to have some problems with your fingers.
could there be a move now, or could there be room to move matches here earlier on days we know the weather is going to be so hot?
36 degrees. i'm not sure what the court temperature was.
to can you explain your tattoos?
are they symbols that are...
does the condition today make you a little bit tentative about melbourne next week?
you've had, i think, more time on court than anyone today in today's hot weather. how did you find it?
how much time have you had here to prepare?
so do you feel acclimatized yet?
it's been quite some time since you last played lleyton. looking forward to it?
you've had some famous matches with him. i think early on you said some things that annoyed him and he played better in that circumstance, but the last time you played you beat him. do you think he's easier to play if you don't annoy him before the match?
how do you feel your form is right now? are you in peak form?
what you do you think you need to improve?
do you take for granted that you understand how everyone plays, or do you do research to prepare for that particular player?
each person you're going to play, tomorrow and others.
you had a great year last year except maybe at the grand slams. is your goal to do better at the grand slams this year? is that one of your goals?
do you have other goals for this year, too?
winning the davis cup?
you seem to have reached an agreement with your new racquet.
how long were you able to practice with it before?
how much more comfortable are you with it this week than last week?
there was a little bit of criticism about how you played in brisbane. how do you react to that?
it was very hot on court today.
ever?
seems like you wanted to get off the court as quick as possible today.
are you happy with the way you played today?
when it's as hot as this, is it more difficult to keep concentration?
thoughts on playing ancic next.
do you feel like mathieu was affected by the heat today?
more than you?
players often say it's harder to defend a title. how do you see your prospects going into the australian open?
pretty good work out.
you seem to be more attacking. has that been something you've been working on with rochey?
how's your hip feeling?
next you've got janko tipsarevic. your thoughts on him?
speaking of hanging in there, the two matches in perth and here, dropping the first set, that might not have been a bad thing for you. is that the way you look at it?
when will the questions about your hip stop?
are you prepared for that?
if you had to rate it at one to ten at the moment, how do you see your body and form?
is it just the center court crowd, or do you lift here? can you explain why such good results here in sydney?
do you get people asking you in the locker room how you get that serve to kick like that?
what personal goals have you set for this year?
the wind, lleyton said it favored - or suggested it favored - coming to the net a little bit. do you think that helped?
yeah, harder to hit passing shots.
how far are you away from finding a coach?
as pleasing as your game was, sometimes you opened up the court and couldn't put the shot away.
it's important for you to make a bit of progress at this event, given the points you're defending?
how good to get that win after the qualifying result in brisbane?
did doubles help you, you think?
are you someone who temperamentally needs a coach to push you along?
are there any areas of your game that you still need to improve?
how did you feel out there today?
how was your off-season? what did you do?
what kind of horse?
for show jumping?
so you jump horses?
how many horses do you have, just one?
so is this a career after tennis that you want to go into?
because they can go into their 60s.
so have you always had horses?
yeah. so how long have you been riding? how old were you when you started?
how old were you when you started riding?
so you've been doing it all your life?
what are your goals for this year?
can you put the your finger on anything last year that saw you slip a little bit?
so you're a little bit mentally tired from the previous years, you think?
does that make your time in australia this time around especially important?
who do you say is the favorite for the australian open?
is it an exciting time to be part of the men's tour given the fact it's so open at the moment?
what's the name of the hours?
is he a thoroughbred?
how tough was it when he broke back in the third set?
overall it seemed like an up-and-down match. did it feel like that for you?
when it's close, is the fact that you have such an amazing record here, you seem to play well here, does that help? does that give you a different degree of confidence?
yes. just playing so well here.
would you say it was your toughest final here?
yes.
are you able to carry the confidence to next week?
and for barcelona, five also.
does it represent something special for you to win five titles here?
do you realize you made something very huge?
you said at the start of the week you were going to play without strapping on your knees. how are your knees at the end of the tournament?
you think you won't play with them in the future?
when you win in monte-carlo, after you win in roland garros. is that a good sign?
can you talk about novak's performance. is that one of the best games he's played against you on clay?
you improved a lot on hard surfaces. do you think you can improve on clay?
what would you like to improve most?
you made a superb effort to break back in the third set, and after that you scored only three points.
how difficult is it? it seems like it's almost impossible to know when to be aggressive or when to stay back. is that the real challenge?
can we say it was a little bit similar to the match in hamburg?
does this performance give you hope in terms of rafa on clay?
what was the problem with the back?
if it is so tough to win one set off of nadal, how difficult is it to win possibly two or three?
you were up 6-2, 5-2, then what happened? you lost four of five games. was it because of him or you, or both?
did you feel he improved since the last time you played him on clay last year?
11 or 12.
can you talk about playing novak.
do you feel unbeatable here?
not many people expected that murray could play so well on clay. maybe you did. what is your impression about him in terms of development of game? can he adjust to clay so he can become your toughest opponent, as it was federer until last year?
i'm talking about clay.
you have won 30 sets in a row in monaco. what does it mean to you?
what was your strategy coming to the net against murray? before the match, what did you think about murray?
is it an advantage to have beaten novak in davis cup recently on clay?
the singles semifinal, it was a tough match. you really had to fight, didn't you?
in terms of your week so far, have you surprised yourself at how well you have made the adaptation?
tomorrow is it 'mission impossible'?
he's on a winning streak.
so you believe?
you remember hamburg. you were very close.
so the game plan could be to do the same but a little bit better?
do you have any special strategy against him?
totally different conditions between last night and today. was it difficult for you to adjust your game?
you talked about your fitness; wanting to improve your endurance.
is it kind of helpful in some way to have to back up very quickly like that and test yourself?
were you impressed by yourself today?
did you think you would be able to do so well, so early in the clay season?
we have been talking a lot about the rankings, how you are close to federer, murray is close to you. how much do you think about that? not at all? does it worry you?
weren't you afraid to lose your concentration playing the role of hugh hefner last night?
'more', you mean in different tournaments?
what did you enjoy more to perform?
no video on youtube in the next day?
did you impersonate players?
which ones?
very impressive win. did you expect such an easy win?
the deep ball, is it something you work on?
do you feel like you're having those good days more and more?
your best surface, is it still clay or hard court? what would you say?
you must know that everybody is expecting you to play well here because of the results you had in the past. do you feel like you have no pressure because last year you didn't do so well here, or do you feel pressure because people want you to win more matches?
you are without a coach here. when you want advice...
so yesterday you phoned to darren cahill, gil reyes, sven groenefeld?
was it kind of just bad timing all day today, with the weather and everything? did that have any effect on how it went today?
do you feel when you don't have the timing on the forehand, do you know pretty quickly it's going to be a tough day?
does it hurt more or less to lose to stan?
do you think you had enough preparation on clay? is that part of the problem coming in?
do you think playing two matches here in monte-carlo will help for the next tournaments?
is there any way you will try to play next week or will you just practice?
does it make any difference to lose to another swiss?
the day before yesterday you had a very tough match. does it seem strange today to be out of it so quickly?
did the transition from hard courts to clay go well for you?
what was your state of mind before that match?
what did you laugh about at the end of the match?
you were the last french player. how can you explain these bad results?
is it embarrassing for french tennis one month away from the french open?
obviously a very easy win today on paper. did you expect a harder match?
you play andy tomorrow. last time you played was in montral, yeah?
having beaten berdych and now cilic, is this like one of your best runs of two results in a row?
you say you know andy well from junior days. are you surprised that he's got to 4 in the world?
how old were you when you first played andy?
doesn't matter.
when you played him in juniors, were you thinking he would be a big star in tennis?
were you friends at juniors with murray?
three match points. was that a good kind of a workout; something you needed to get your confidence?
what is the most challenging thing for you about the adjustments to clay?
when was your first contact with clay this year?
and do you know approximately how many hours you spent on clay this year before this match?
is it something that you enjoy, playing on clay? is there a challenge in it?
you mentioned bad bounces. is that why you hold back the way you play your first few matches on clay?
you played a few times versus seppi. did you find any change in his way of playing? does he play always the same?
are you looking forward to playing stan? second time this year.
some players use sports psychologists seemingly more and more these days. have you ever used one? what do you think of the idea of using one?
do you think they offer something to people, something extra to the players?
given that you're one of the top players in the world, how do you feel having to play on an outside court today?
how do you feel your clay court form is now?
do you feel ready for a top guy like nalbandian?
was this match, like you said yesterday, you had no reference points to be able to play on clay?
what is it then?
do you believe playing a qualifier first round coming back from the united states was a tricky match?
but you didn't know this one?
when was the last time you played as badly as this?
are you worried?
what bothered you in his game? he's a left-hander? he was hitting the lines too often?
four winners.
what is your schedule now?
you didn't like him in the us open already. it was the same today?
was it difficult after the week in casablanca?
but overall it was a good beginning of the season? you are happy?
was it deliberately planned that you wouldn't go to barcelona?
are you pleased with last week?
you must be pleased you have beaten a guy who just won a title on clay. it's a good sign for you.
were you satisfied with the way you moved on the court?
next is nicolas lapentti.
what is your overall feeling about how you're playing at the moment?
you manage to have good sensations during the match?
a comfortable start that you like?
do you almost go into a first match on a different surface allowing yourself to not play that well; almost like it's okay to get it out of the way as much as anything?
as far as the actual clay is concerned, roland garros, obviously madrid you don't know, but here or rome...
it's better to play under the flag of monte-carlo than the french flag?
the match was completely under control?
you feel you are adapting well to clay?
this is home. and it is also a big tournament.
you passed the first round. weren't you disappointed you had to play on such a small court? after all, you are the local player.
people usually think you are french. does it bother you?
you must be reasonably pleased with that. a good start.
how long does it normally take you to adjust?
physically how are you feeling?
will you be doing anything different in that sense?
i'd like to talk about it's a long time since we didn't see the joking side of djokovic. we have the impression we lost this part of you since two years. what do you think about this advertising from this morning with head? do you think you're going to go farther and farther?
could you imagine roger federer making the same advertising?
when you say give yourself a new air or aura on clay, what do you mean by that?
he beat you easily last year in a challenger. what was different this time?
how do you keep your motivation? you are 32 years old.
i'll rephrase my question. where do you find the physical strength to keep fighting that way?
some players say it's better to win when they don't play well.
you have no coach? someone was there.
can we say your friend is your coach?
how did you start this season?
are you going to rome?
you started slowly but played better in the second set.
but on clay you need to be able to defend from the baseline.
do you have problems physically?
were you sick in houston, as well?
otherwise you are fit physically?
you were discovered by the french public in the french open last year. do you feel they are going to have expectations?
tell us about your match today.
you once were in the quarterfinals of the french open. does it seem very far away?
why didn't you go to casablanca?
what was your best result in this tournament here?
so it's always difficult for you to start playing on clay?
what is your next step?
how happy are you today with the match?
you've been playing here for a week?
do you like this tournament in particular?
what about your next match?
fernando, three set points on the tiebreak. talk about what you did to close it out?
you've had a pretty poor summer, struggled throughout the year after the australian open. does this give you confidence going into the open?
did you feel fatigued after playing two tiebreakers this afternoon?
you handled his serve better than anybody else this week. what was the key to that?
have you had a tournament where you played the semifinals indoors and the championship match outdoors?
you've been here five times now. what does it mean to win this title?
you got broken in the first game of the match. was it a slow start because of the different conditions?
two tough tiebreak sets in the match. are you glad you were able to finish it in two sets before the final tonight?
what will you do now, between now and the final?
and you're playing sam in the final. what are your expectations?

what will you do now, between now and the final?
and you're playing sam in the final. what are your expectations?
how frustrating was it not being able to get on court yesterday and having to come back this morning?
got a break in the second game of the first set. that set you up for the match?
how important is starting off a match well to you?
what were you pleased about with that performance today?
did you notice any difference between the outdoor and indoor courts in terms of speed?
what do you do you between now and waiting for the final?
can you explain the ups and downs of that match. looked like you were out of it, then you were in control of it.
talk about his return game.
did you feel a little stiff coming out? you looked a little tired.
what was it like playing two matches? what did you do between the two matches?
can you talk about the seventh game of the second set, 10 deuces, then you broke him, and up three in the tiebreaker. what did you do to regain your confidence?
as much as you probably wanted to win tonight, do you feel it might have been a blessing that you won l.a., you won the us open series, a lot of attention on you right now, might take the spotlight off for the us open, you can focus on your tennis?
he's serving 15-40 at 6-5. what was he able to do?
crowd was rowdy. do you like that?
do you like the us open for that reason?
do you feed off the energy of crowds at the us open then?
have you noticed that as you shot up with the samurai club, is that something you've watched develop?
pretty pleased with the way this week went overall? you played pretty well here, didn't you?
did you make it to taylor swift last night?
how was it?
have you had a chance to think about what that means now, to go behind roddick at the open?
run me through what you're thinking. you had such a great match. you're down 15-40 on your serve.
they weren't nearly as boisterous as l.a., but you had some samurai guys up there. talk about the whole fan club phenomenon.
can you talk about how your serve is really a weapon for you, how much confidence you have.
nikolay is such a great baseline player. obviously you rely on your serve a lot. what else did you do because of how he plays to counter that today?
he said you have a better forehand now, you're actually hitting winners with it. have you done something with that? are you hitting the ball a little bit better?
he also said you're running better. is that a result of fitness or better court awareness out there?
he also said your play is kind of an all american style right now. i'm not sure what he meant, but do you see similarities in the top americans' games that you would be lumped together?
i don't know if you have seen the draw for the open. if you both are able to advance, you would see nikolay again in the third round. would that be an advantage to either of you?
when you come out in a match, you get to serve, first two serves are aces, how does that set you up for the rest of the match confidence-wise?
can you talk about expectations and pressure, the more success you have, the more expectations are put on you, how you respond to that and how you use that?
your assistant got some pretty big-time ink in sports illustrated.
have you teased him? can you talk about enjoying the ride up in sports, a pretty fun thing for young guys.
was he the one that created this samurai phenomenon or had that been building? it's got to be fun to see those guys chanting like crazy.
indianapolis flew a few of your friends out. are you going to talk to anne about getting a few more out here tomorrow?
in the ninth game you had two breakpoints and it looked like the match turned at that point. can you talk about those last two games.
what adjustments did you make against his serve after the first set? you returned much better after the first set.
is the wrist injury from today?
outside of his serve, what impresses you about his game, how much he's improved as a player?
have you had a chance to see the us open draw?
you have a qualifier.
if you play querrey in the third round, do you feel what you did today when you played good was okay?
talk about the match.
not closing it out, was that on your end or did he step up and make some great shots against you?
what do you do what that happens to get yourself back? how are you able to bounce back?
look ahead to tomorrow, can you talk about verdasco or melzer, what your thoughts would be on either one of them?
where do you feel your game is compared to a year ago? how do you feel about your level right now?
compared to last year at this time.
how do you compare the barrage of when he was at his best during that match with similar barrages you've had from other top players?
when did you know you were physically the fresher of the two players?
were you still worried that you would run out of time in that second set, that he wouldn't falter enough?
what were your thoughts at the time of his medical timeout? you looked upset at that moment. did you think he was milking it to be...
how much confidence does this win here give you towards the us open?
did the fact that you secured a spot, the no.2 spot in the ranking yesterday, did that help a little bit or make you a bit looser?
what will you remember more from this tournament? getting to no.2 in the world or actually winning the event?
how much of your success here do you attribute to the fitness regime you've undertaken that built up preparation in florida?
what was it like playing in front of this crowd here in montreal?
can you talk about what alex corretja brings to your tennis?
after the first two close sets, what worked for you in the third to win it?
when you're in london, do you still work a bit with coach louis cayer, who is from here and worked a bit with you two years ago when you came back when you were injured?
how satisfying is it to have this win after i guess a little bit of disappointment in the semifinal of wimbledon?
are you definitely going to cincinnati? will there be any thought of this being -- you sort of grabbed your hip a little bit near the umpire's chair after the match, after the presentation.
was this a record for autograph signing this week, you think?
in wimbledon you can get away from the crowd. here the crowd is very...
can you talk about your decision not to go up to the net more? is that because of murray's ability to hit very good passing shots, or did you want to go to the net more? is it better to stay back?
andy has moved to no.2 in the world. what makes him difficult to play?
based on your experience here, do you expect to come back to this tournament again regularly now?
how do you feel the tiebreak went today? because you had a couple of chances to win.
do you think it was those dropshots that made the difference?
how would you assess your performance tonight?
on the match point that you had, you were speaking to the umpire and you were calling something out. i was just wondering your issue. were you just not ready? was there a noise from the crowd?
you did have a couple of match points even though your serve wasn't 100%.
you had one match point?
do you have a positive you can take away from the match?
you've lost two very tight matches to del potro the last week. what is it about his game that is difficult? what do you think makes him as good as he is?
before the last game, it feels like you talked to your box, maybe your coach. is there anything you said or you were just frustrated?
i have a lot of people who listen to -- i do radio. they love hockey; they love football. they don't necessarily know that much about tennis. if anyone can draw a parallel, it might be you because you come from the longhorn state. is there any kind of commonality between football and tennis you can draw?
the kind of mentality you bring to the game, just for people who aren't really into tennis but might want to learn about it.
that's a parallel with hockey, not football.
how did you feel when you were down 5-1 in the third set and it looked like it was going to be over?
how were you able to turn it around? i mean, it's just remarkable.
at what stage in that third set did you really think you could win it?
the injury, can you describe it? and did the pain of it lessen as you continued to play?
did you have an injury, and did it lessen as you continued to play, the pain of it?
what does a victory like this do for your confidence from now to the us open?
i wanted to know what you thought about playing andy murray tomorrow in the semifinals.
would you like to proclaim yourself the real no.4?
how confident are you now?
in a matchup like that, does the better movement come into play because he's so good at moving the ball around?
how did you feel you were hitting the ball today?
it gives you a little break to play during the night for the heat and all this?
your ability to win tiebreakers has been coming through for you this week. do you feel it's been especially important for you?
you mentioned just now that you feel like you're breaking serve more. what do you think the key to that has been, the return that you have improved?
you won here six years ago. is there any thoughts in your head about repeating for the title here?
would you like a rematch tomorrow with del potro or would you rather play rafa?
did you know what to expect of yourself coming off of wimbledon? how has it been compared to what you expected?
i noticed in the past six months it seems like your net game has improved exponentially. do you feel like that's an area that helped you get better results this year?
if you're playing rafa, are you curious what his form will be? and a few words on rafa.
how were the conditions out there today?
so how would you rate your performance?
it was pretty important those last two games, wasn't it? if you allowed it to go to three, it could have been different, couldn't it? you played a good service game at 4-all.
you've done exceedingly well in the masters events the last couple of season. what do you think you need to do with your game in order to translate that into perhaps winning a grand slam?
how much do you feel the training you did in miami -- is that a huge part of how well prepared you are to play here?
how long were you in miami?
two weeks?
would you rather play, in this time of year in north america, play in hot, humid weather just because you think you have an advantage?
is it hard for a guy from scotland -- i know you were in barcelona for a while -- to get used to a place like miami?
on a day like this, do you know how much weight you lose during a match?
if you play roger, he's been talking a fair bit about, say, the january period almost to rome when his back was bothering him and you played him a couple times in there. do you think this will be a different roger if you play him now than he was in those matches?
an adjective to describe what happened if you can, roger? how do you describe that?
do you feel when you wonder if your opponent is injured that it's hard to stay in it in that moment?
was it windy? because the serve...
are there any elements of last year when you came in and against simon, maybe you hadn't played enough after wimbledon. this year you had a longer rest. does anything like that...
what do you take overall from the tournament and the three matches you got in here?
what will you look to improve for in cincinnati?
if you forget the first set, it's 6-1, 5-1, can you recall letting one get away like that that you've dominated for that long a period?
how difficult a player is he? you played him before, but what are the real challenges for you? is it streakiness?
what was going through your head as the games kept slipping away at the end of the third?
how did you feel out there today?
you said you weren't happy with your play since madrid. now, what do you feel about after this tournament?
did the match turn in the game that looked like he was going to get broken and in the end didn't, the one where he actually had it and you just showed so much honesty and integrity and said, andy, that's out?
how did you feel about your game tonight? how did you feel about how you played?
what are you looking forward to tomorrow in your match against roger?
you said in french earlier (speaking french). what did you mean by that?
what do you have to do to be successful against him tomorrow?
tonight the top 8 guys in the world all reached the quarterfinal for the first time. how does it feel for you to be part of that?
looked like he was giving you a pretty good workout on the groundstrokes today.
did you have any problem reading them?
yeah. or he was just hitting them well?
how satisfying is it to come through like that when it's that tight and obviously some very high quality tennis from both of you?
looked like you were going a lot to his forehand. is there a reason why you weren't hitting more to his backhand?
you must get this question a lot, considering your status: 31 tiebreak wins and only 8 lost this year. you can't explain that just on the serve. what do you do in tiebreaks for a phenomenal record like that?
you have a big matchup coming up against novak djokovic. can you talk about that a bit, please?
do you feel pretty confident playing against him? i think you won your last couple against him on hardcourts.
i think we've seen all the top seeds who should be getting through to the quarterfinals getting through. there is a possibility of all 8 top seeds getting into the quarterfinals. what does that say to you about where the men's game is at now?
was heat and humidity a factor at all today?
getting better every day?
how's the knee?
did you feel that your footwork today was better, the footwork?
what can you say about your opponent for tomorrow?
4. 6.
the decision to enter the doubles competition with your coach, francisco roig, was that more of a strategic move for him to be able to look at your game closer side by side, or was it because you had nobody else like to play with because it was late entering?
did you enjoy it, that experience?
what's the main difference between your footwork on the clay and on the hardcourt?
are you trying to slide on hardcourts? you never try that?
(in spanish.)
do you feel confident having a chance to beat
do you worry about your ranking at all now?
you wouldn't be upset if you dropped down to no.3?
the white shorts today, were they the ones you were supposed to wear at wimbledon?
completely different?
did toni watch your match on tv?
did you talk to him?
your father didn't play tennis very much, i don't think. but how much of your fight, your trying so hard, your competition part, how much comes from your father?
but when he watches you, he's very intense.
besides playing tennis, what did you do in montreal the last few days?
to be playing as well as that in your second match back is a pretty hopeful sign, isn't it?
what was the key getting the early breaks again in both sets? was that partly why you got on top?
when you play a guy so recently but on a different surface, does it feel familiar when you're in the match? does it feel like the same kind of match, or was it very different to your grass court meeting?
so are you surprised at how quickly everything clicked into place today?
it seemed pretty hot out there. you have had a training break. presumably you're fresh and fit, but still, is it a factor to finish matches fairly soon to conserve energy or not?
with the heat in montreal right now, you must be pleased that you train and practice in miami? the heat is not a factor for you?
was that a step up in your performance today from your other match, you think?
were the conditions a little bit better today, cooler?
do you feel good about this, playing here, because you won here?
you could play andy roddick next. what are your thoughts about him?
you're preparing for a grand slam obviously here. seems that almost everybody was off after wimbledon and a new season begins now. now you're in the middle of a grand slam caliber draw. is it a high, steep climb after a layoff like this? for every one of you, not just you.
would you rather have a more gradual hill to climb instead of, you know, something like this?
were you a little bit rusty today, do you think?
your match, did you feel a little bit rusty? you took a while to really get going?
if gilles simon wins, you'll play him in the next round if he wins his match today. what are your thoughts on playing against him if he is to win?
your thoughts on how you felt on the court today?
how did the courts and the balls compare to what you played already this summer?
is that something the players talk about? is there anything you can do about it?
well, no. i'm just wondering whether you can talk...
i mean, is it something you do talk about?
what balls were you using in washington?
is it the balls and the court too leading up to the us open?
can you talk about your next opponent, fernando?
you were 1 and 2 against andreev before. is that a guy who gives you trouble generally, or was it just the statistics?
have you tried to do anything -- i know it's always the same sort of question, but a carryover from wimbledon, your level of play, is there anything you can do to sort of carry it through when you have a break like that?
(indiscernible.)
i'm sure you had these questions last week, about how knocked out have you been by reaction to your performance, especially in the final?
how would you assess your chances to make it to the final here, which would be a third straight final for you?
did the mailman get through to you?
have you seen the guy again?
what are the common themes or reactions have been from people seeing you with new eyes?
seeing you with whole new eyes. is that a bit unsettling considering how long you've been around?
do you feel you're the same person you were when you were no.1? obviously everybody evolves.
your reaction to all this stuff, how much do you think it's just wimbledon? as much as you like the
the crowd, after everything that's ever happened since then, is there anything quite like them chanting your name right after the match?
how did that feel to compete so well against one of the world's top players?
are you a little disappointed? you had a lot of break points and -- you both had a lot of break points and didn't really take advantage of it.
what was your feeling when you were up 3-0 in the first set?
you had three games you were down 15-40 and you came back with some big serves.
what do you take out of this experience, getting to the second round playing really well against a top guy?
do you have an event before the us quallies?
what memories are you going to have after playing such a strong game tonight against roger federer?
what was it like playing against such a big player like roger?
as you're retiring this year, what is your feeling about playing for the last time at this tournament where you played someone...
what do you plan to do after your tennis career?
would you like to maybe be a tennis pro?
nice touch with the canadiens jersey. why did you wear that tonight?
was it hard keeping your emotions in check tonight?
was it hard keeping your emotions under control tonight?
do you feel like you've left men's tennis and canada stronger than what you found it? can you comment a bit on your part in the legacy?
has raonic ever asked you for advice? all the times you've seen him here, has he asked you for any kind of tips?
what about off the court and beyond, just the guys he's playing, how the life is and something he can expect?
girls?
ideal start for you?
is that the sort of match you wanted as your first match back at the beginning of the long haul into the us open?
making big shots, is that...
how much was the character of the match determined by the fact that you made breaks at the start of both those two sets, how the whole thing shaped after that?
a lot of people think you're a clever player. even chardy says that about your tactics and that you are a smart player. do you really think you are or is that naturally the way you play?
do you think some guys are more macho and think the only way you can win is play aggressively with lots of power and stuff?
do you think that with nadal having trouble with his knees and federer having taken a break and changes in his family that this tournament and tournaments in the next few weeks are more wide open, are more there for someone other than those two to beat?
i'm sure you were disappointed not being in the final, but did you watch the wimbledon final?
when if you are watching the very end of it, are you actually cheering for one guy or the other, pulling for one guy or the other?
is no.2 on your mind at all?
how tough is it to get out there and play these days? do you find it difficult or...
body is feeling good now?
were you pleased with the way you fought in the second set?
do you think you'll be able to step it up the next couple of days in terms of your practicing? did you feel like the leg wasn't affecting you too much?
have you been watching kim's comeback at all?
before this week, your last couple of losses were in tough matches against very good players. what do you think the difference is between winning those matches and not being...
when you keep getting injured like this and try to come back, do you feel like you take a lot of steps back every time or...
what's the toughest part, physical or mental?
is it frustrating to know guys you beat four or five years ago you struggle with now?
for a player like you who has been at the top and trying to get back, when you see a situation like federer or nadal, does that limit your expectations going into a grand slam or a tournament?
i know it seems like rafa and roger take a lot of the attention and kind of everybody else is in the shadows. does that make a difference at all?
how did you feel out there, first match back since wimbledon?
can you take us through the process of deciding to play here rather than waiting for an extra week to come back?
this was probably the last match for frederic in montreal. tell us about your relationship, what you think about him as a player and a person?
obviously after a few weeks off there is some rust you have to shake off. how much of what you did out there tonight was rust and how much of it, if any, was adjusting to your new routine, your new lifestyle? was there any part of that into it? did you have to make some adjustments, some changes?
off the court there was no change to your routine or anything? life goes on as normal?
you're not the only person who -- rafa is also back on tour now after a few weeks off for very different reasons. his knee is of concern for everyone. everyone is watching to see how he does. gal monfils came in and his knee was iced. david nalbandian is out with hip surgery. james blake has a foot injury. how do you manage to stay so injury-free? is there any special precaution that you take? you seem particularly good remaining injury-free.
a year ago this time you had an uncommonly early exit from the tournament when it was in toronto, and obviously what a difference a year makes. you have two grand slams under you're belt since then. a lot has changed, but what you sort of taught so many people way beyond the bounds of tennis is about persevering in the way of criticism, doubt, difficulties. and i'm just wondering if you can comment a bit on how you might do that, what you hold on to? because that is a real lesson for everyone in and out of the sport.
how much do you look forward to a tournament like this right now at this stage of the career you're in? how hard is it to get motivated to come out here to montreal, for instance? although it is a masters event, is it still hard to get motivated with everything you've achieved?
that's a nice t-shirt you have there.
how did you feel out there today?
did you see anything in his game that you liked?
what have you been doing since wimbledon?
why did you only play doubles in umag?
and was that where you were training before coming here?
was that where you were training before coming here?
this is a little bit off, but you are on the player council and a lot of us haven't heard from adam helfant since january. i just wondered if you could talk a little bit about the conversations you've had with him and maybe a little about his priorities.
that was the resumption of a long rivalry? it's been a while since you guys played?
how did you feel you played out there?
djokovic in the next round?
the pressure that you felt, was that kind of self-generated or was it the environment?
did he play davis cup because you were sick?
talk about the strategy of tomorrow's match. i mean, you playing one of the top in the world. so with a guy who won the tournament two years ago, how do you approach that?
have you played on center court before?
is that going to be intimidating, or you just put that out of your mind?
do you try to feed off the energy of the crowd?
the rain delay, did that have an effect on you?
would you have preferred that a victory like this come from an established player rather than the way it kind of worked out that you faced a guy kind of lower in the rankings?
can you tell us about what happened on the injury? what went through your mind when you...
where exactly?
what worked for you today in winning this match?
talk a little bit about your last rogers cup. what does it mean to you playing in almost your hometown not far from deauville? what's going through your mind this week?
what are your thoughts on playing federer?
have you got him at a good time, you think? it's his first match for basically a month.
you're very faithful to this tournament here in canada. why do you like coming back here?
do you have mixed feelings about not being able to get out to vancouver last week? in retrospect, are you glad you had the rest and able to prepare for this?
the fact that you're retiring after this year, does that change your attitude? can you relax a little more?
you worry less about points and things like that?
how much more do you plan on playing this year?
when was the last time you played peter?
it's been that long?
looked like you played him pretty tough out there. is there anything you think you could have done that you should do or didn't do?
where do you go from here? i know you're going back to school for a semester. are you planning to get out in some of the tournaments?
any futures or anything you can squeeze in in between or...
is there anything that he surprised you with?
does it give you confidence staying out there with him and taking him to a tiebreaker?
are you surprised to be here?
does that change your outlook? were you thinking about playing again or this experience the last couple of months change your plans or anything?
you said yesterday you're very happy to make the final. it's a good achievement for you. how do you feel now?
how difficult is it to hit winners against nikolay?
is he a little bit underrated? people don't really think of him that much, you know. they know he's in the top 10, but nobody talks about his game and whatever. do people not give him enough credit for the player he is?
it was the same story that it was last year in miami?
completely different?
are you surprised that he hasn't won a grand slam yet? because with the type -- you say he has all the shots. how come he hasn't won a grand slam?
i don't know. (laughter.)
in your mind, do you have an idea of when you expect to be playing at your absolute best with calm?
i just wondered against a player like nikolay, i think you played one dropshot today. is he a very tough player to play that shot against, especially?
your quarterfinal and semifinal your opponent retired in a row. do you think it's part of reason you lose this match today? because you are not --
-- physically and mentally warmed up?
yesterday after losing the semifinal, novak just give us three-minutes press conference after three-hours tennis, actually, because he tends to give one-sentence answer to every question. but you always handle loss very well, including press conference, which we really appreciate. my question is we all know how win means to players, but could you tell us what lose means to you?
what are your feelings? and did you think that it would be so easy, quote unquote?
win, two sets.
how does this compare with your previous two masters wins, bercy and miami?
what's the difference for you playing nadal and federer?
you seemed to attack nadal's backhand a lot today, and he hit the slice a lot today. that was your plan? do you think that's the best way to beat nadal?
when you retired against soderling in the
you've been in the top 10 i think since like may 2005 except for a few weeks this year. yet you kind of go below the radar in terms of attention and everything. does that bother you, or you're happy to not be like the focus of articles, and, you know, a lot of fanfare? how do you feel on that?
obviously you have had a great career so far, but after watching you defeat no.3 and no.2 player in the world, people might wonder why you haven't been ranked even higher and achieve more in grand slam. your explanation?
what were you thinking during the championship point as a final challenge? it seemed like you were afraid to look at the result. and the second question is most players just feel tired at end of season and just get injured, but you keep on in good form. how did you manage that?
your serve is so good all the week, and it always around 200 just when you play key points, 40-30, 30-40, deuce. is that your tactic, to save energy for the moment and make the opponents feel frustrated and shock?
the ioc president presented you the trophy and he invited you to next olympic games after seeing your excellent performance here. what's your --
the next one, 2012. what's your --
my real question is...
my real question is: what's your thought on the rest of your career, next year, maybe?
what do you think of rafa's speed, the speed of his running? do you think it's the same as it was before, couple years ago? do you think he's slower, faster? does he move around the court as fast as he used to?
can you talk us through the injury, when it became a problem? was it a problem in previous matches or did it just happen tonight?
it seemed as though you had asked for a trainer before you twisted your ankle. is that correct or not?
no, but at 5-0 you didn't ask for a trainer?
how do you feel? i mean, it seems very unlucky that you've made this semifinal, had a great week, and it ends like this in a very disappointing and strange way.
when you were fit obviously in the first set, how do you think rafa was playing? you've obviously played him before. what do you think his game was?
what does the injury mean for you now? how long will you have to rest, and where do you go from here?
so after yesterday's match there was no problem? you just woke up this morning, and your foot was sore. where is the infection? in the toe?
not really.
is it the toe or...
but last night, no problems?
just a question about spanish tennis in general. it seems very, very strong this year, last year. why do you think spanish tennis is so strong and you have so many good players?
can we just ask you about rafa? he's someone you obviously know very well. would you expect him to come back as strong as he was, for example, a year ago? and do you think that he can continue playing the sort of schedule he has played in the past?
what's the problem with you in the tiebreak?
given your good performances so far in china, how much of a disappointment is this, this kind of a day?
is it physical fitness is your main problem in this match?
no? so what is the main problem you met today?
is this one of the best matches he played against you?
could you comment on the organization of shanghai atp 1000 series? are you satisfied with the organization?
looking to london, obviously this is a blow. do you feel you can bounce back from this? will this provide more motivation perhaps going to london?
(in chinese.) today's match, do you think this is a very hard competition? are you feeling any pressures from the serve of djokovic?
(in chinese.) are you feeling some pressure from the serve from your opponent?
it was quite a match to come through. you seemed to have a lot more in the tiebreaker than he did. could you talk about the tiebreaker a little bit?
he owned you on this court before. he won the two matches last year. is it a little bit of a revenge today?
a lot?
can you talk about rafa or feliciano? and also you have a good record in finals this year. you've won all the three you were in.
you've been very relaxed this week, i think, so far. but now you're in the final. does the pressure go on? and how do you prepare for a final compared to semis and quarterfinals?
just going back again to what my colleague spoke about earlier, he beat you twice here last year. what was the difference today? were you better or was he worse?
you have won a lot of fans in shanghai this year. do you feel it surprising or happy?
yeah, haven't you noticed?
today i noticed that your wife is watching your game beside the court. when you play this tough game, do you have some eye contact with her, or do you feel support from her?
andre agassi --
he said federer and nadal's era will be over soon and murray and djokovic and del potro will be the one to lead. what do you think about that?
is that because you're not so good looking and keep looking outside the court which makes you put more focus on your tennis? and given a chance, would you like to be more good looking or keep your life going like this?
great game tonight. it must be very frustrating to play someone like djokovic. you play great shots and he keeps getting them back. he keeps returning these impossible shots?
the third set it seemed like you had lost your energy. was it because of all the long rallies that you had between?
what are your short-term goals right now in terms of getting a higher ranking and win?
what about the next year?
i'm from russia, and our player, davydenko, is playing djokovic tomorrow. so any kind of advice you could give to play against a player like djokovic? because they're both defensive players.
i think i'm right in saying it's your first masters semifinal?
and a very impressive way to get there, as well?
you've had a few disappointments this year, haven't you, along the way? some early exits from tournaments? so what was your motivation coming into this part of the year?
soderling was very impressive yesterday, so what was your game plan going into today's match? because soderling was very powerful yesterday and looked very good.
it's always difficult to presume who you might play, but if it were to be rafa, what would the excitement levels be in that one? how would you approach that particular game?
(in chinese.) last week in china open, atp 500, you fell in the first round, but in the shanghai atp 1000, now you're going to be in the semifinal. so what happened? how did you improve between these two weeks?
(in chinese.) a lot of the fans cheer for you. so it seems today it's your home game. so did you expect to be so welcomed in shanghai?
the racquet smashing seemed to help clear the head a little bit, because you then didn't lose a game after that. but it was intense all the way through, wasn't it?
and the moral for the story?
we rarely ever see a guy's match that has six service breaks in a set. what was going on there?
was that the toughest match you've had for the last two weeks in china?
it would be easy for someone in your situation who's already qualified for london, and you've won a title last week, to not take your foot off the gas, but i don't think anyone would expect you to be out of your skin the whole time. that's just not your character.
simon said earlier that every time you beat him in a tournament you go on and win the championships. what's your assessment for this championship after winning the china open?
1 to 10, how do you rate your service game today? it not seemed that well.
do you enjoy playing guys like gilles? and if yes, are there other players which you particularly enjoy matching up with? because it seems as though you're nervous, but seems as though you're really having a good time out there.
but what i meant was the style of his game. do you find that it is a fun style to match up against?
so you don't enjoy playing tennis?
how do you think about a semifinal? you will play davydenko again. last year you play him in the masters cup final, so what do you think about this?
(in chinese.) in this match, you two players had different styles on the court. you are a baseline player, and he's a serve and volleyer. in the second set he had very good quality and net-approach strategy, but you still the final winner of this match. so what's your view on the difference of the players' style? so his style is less and less. does this mean that there is no future for the serve and volleyer?
it's highly likely that you're going to meet djokovic in the semifinal, and you two have met last year in masters cup final. will you be more motivated than last time you guys meet here?
he lost in two sets last time, last year.
you said that in the second set he destroyed you. he dominated you. were you worried at the start of the third set? were you thinking, maybe i could be going home today? it could be all over?
and i guess with the third-set matches it's more dangerous because you cannot get a chance to come back like you do in the grand slam in the five-setters, even though they're harder, physically?
we all saw your beautiful wife there by the side of the court. does it make a big difference that she's here with you? as for someone in their late 20s, has family become a large part of the motivation that gets you going?
in general, you always play good when season is going to end. any the reasons about that?
i have two questions for you. the first one is you made a big step today for the race to london. how much is it important for you at that point? and the second one is about, i know you are in the middle of a big fight with your sponsor for clothing in france. can you tell me what the situation is right now about that?
first of all, it was a big match for you. can you talk about that in regards to points for london and you two being so close?
this point, this moment in the first set where there is a controversial 30-all, 40-30 or 30-40, how did you live that, and how did you see that point?
the first time you played in shanghai was actually in 2003. you actually play very good in the semifinal.
did you remember the time, six years ago? and i remember six years ago you come here like were no.100. now you are almost no.10. so can you talk about your involvement and development as a player? also, tournament in shanghai.
you had long hair at that time.
obviously you have a great season this year. do you think how much that marcus norman helped you to improve your tennis?
what do you feel made the difference today? were you surprised also by the level of jo going down?
asia is so far away from your home country, but you did so well in asia last week in beijing semifinal and now in shanghai. so can we say you feel very comfortable in asia?
just a little fun question. i remember while you are in heineken open, they ask a player to try snake.
snake, eat snake.
maybe norman is one of them. i'm not sure.
my question is: have you tried anything different or strange in beijing and shanghai?
in the match today your volleying was very good when you came to the net, but i've watched you practice this week and you don't seem to practice it a lot, so have you been working on your net game, your volleying?
because, as you said, tommy played very well in the start of the second set, so how did you get out of that problem that you had?
where do you think your game is right now in terms of, you know, generally where your game has been at the top, in comparison, and what needs to be fixed?
is it a lack of playing matches or a lack of confidence or a little bit of both?
how frustrating was it back in new york when you had your abdominal problem? because you used to come into press conferences after matches and say, i don't want to talk about it, i don't want to talk about it. it must have been very frustrating. and how have you recovered -- you've recovered quite quickly from it. what sort of treatment did you have? was it just rest, or did you have special treatment?
i know it's difficult for you tennis players to comment on this, but would it be better if the fans in the stands would actually stay quiet during play and serving, on serves?
how are you able to look so fresh or look so fresh at the end of the season while your rivals and colleagues are getting injured and having to withdraw?
watching the game, it looked quite comfortable out there. how was it for you on the court?
during this tournament, did you have any opportunity to watch other games like on tv?
any games that you liked?
you have defeated fernando six straight times, and you just lost one set. people always talk about how powerful his forehand is, so why so easy for you to handle?
is that a strategy when you guys play against a guy like gonzlez to make him lose his mind? because you know that this can happen with him?
what do you need to do to make him go a little crazy?
a lot of the players this week are saying that the year is too long, there's too many tournaments, whatever, but you're a guy who actually likes to play a lot. i was wondering what you think about that. is the season too long? should there be more of an offseason?
just in general. forget this year.
you're right now ranked no.8 in the world, but you have lots of points defend before the season end including the 800 points you got from shanghai last year. so can you share some thoughts about qualifying for london?
speaking of this tournament, djokovic said it's one of the best tournaments put on for the players. what do they do special that makes it, you know, good for you guys?
could you please briefly talk about your match and how you prepared for this match?
so it is your first time to play with top 10? could you please talk about your previous meetings with top 10 and also your meeting with tsonga. what's your gap with top 10 in addition to some tactics? and also, how can you bridge those gaps in the new term?
yesterday you mentioned that basically you don't care about the techniques of your opponent and you want to be predominant in the court. what are your tactics?
and you mentioned that this is not your first meeting with top 10. basically, what's the interval between your meetings with two top-10 players? how big a progress did you see in this interval?
what's your plan for your forthcoming matches?
will this match give you some help to prepare for your match in the national game?
do you still remember your opponent, your previous meeting with top 10?
so basically this is your first time to play in such a high-level tournament. what did you learn most?
just now you mentioned that by playing such high-level tournaments, you started to see more clearly the developments of male tennis. and basically, can you talk about what are those developments, and how can we follow such trends and whether chinese tennis is following the right track?
how did you feel about today's match?
looking at the race for london, there's a lot of people that are still in contention. there's three french players in contention, so it's very important to stay in that race.
(through chinese translation.) before this match, when you were talking about this opponent, you mentioned that you never heard of him. what impression did he leave you after this match? and also, another question is what do you think about where the chinese male players can bring certain positions in the tennis sports in the future?
yesterday you played in the doubles, and you did a lot of things to entertain fans like soccer moves and communicated with the fans. is it a special game, i mean, compared to anything you've played before?
what do you think about your next game? you're playing with robin soderling, and he had a great season this year.
yes.
so you have make it to the masters cup last year, and this year you still have chance. how are you going to value your decision this year?
the season this year.
your reaction after the match was incredible. it was like you won a grand slam, not a second round at the masters. it really meant a lot to you?
were you especially pleased with the way you defended? because you had to defend quite a lot today against some of his really strong groundstrokes.
how would you rate the quality of your tennis in the first set if you compare it to since the us open? has it been one of your best sets?
you won five titles this year, australian open, as well; yet you characterize it as a difficult year for you, which is true. can you just talk about that a little bit? because a lot of people would say, well, that's a pretty good year.
this week in shanghai and last week in beijing, you had a lot of attention, a lot of media interviews, a lot of fans. how do you keep your concentration and your focus on what you have to do on court when you have so much attention off the court here in china?
a lot of people are injured with this tournament. what's your comment on this? do you think this will affect your performance on the court?
i came from japan, tokyo. you have come and played many times in china, especially in shanghai. but i know that it is a tough calendar, but you have not yet come to japan to play. you have many fans. you cannot give us something for the fans in japan for next year?
how do you explain -- i mean, it seems as though you had the match in control in your second set, and then it all shifted. were you tired, or how do you explain the shift in momentum?
do you think that you may have had some dips?
is that pretty difficult to play? how do you treat someone like that? because he can be so dangerous and yet sometimes so poor. for you receiving it, how do you deal with that, or are you just looking after yourself?
when he is playing really well, hitting the ball really well, how good is he?
the fact that he's coached by your former coach, is that something you think about at all before the match?
what do you need to do to win matches like this consistently?
(in chinese) your last match. are you disappointed? what's your plan for the future and what's your next stop? where is your next stop? basically, what's your expectation on this whole year?
you said the other day you thought you still had a grand slam in you. if you look back to when you were no.1, has the game changed much in those intervening years? do you need to be a different player now to win a slam to when you last did?
marat safin has played his last game in china today. he lost. he's obviously not that much older than you, another former no.1. he's decided to call it a day. has it ever crossed your mind to quit, pack up? if not, what keeps you going? what keeps you motivated?
going back to the question before last, would you say therefor that you're a better player now than you were when you were no.1?
there was a lot of talk about the calendar, and we spoke yesterday about andy two days ago who gave a press conference and he spoke about it. now you heard what happened to him yesterday, so it's another big player that dropped out of the tournament. does what happened to andy yesterday, does that make you reflect even more on that topic, or do you want to comment about it?
do we assume that your reaction, that it was very much like the queen's situation where you thought perhaps prevention is better than playing on?
it looked as if you locked it. is that how it felt when you did it?
before you came here, had you looked at what you thought you might need to do to qualify for london?
is it pain in the front of the knee or in the back?
we were told it's left knee pain but didn't say how hard it can be. so how severe the pain is?
it's obviously very frustrating this time of year when you're trying to qualify. it's a big deal for you and must be very disappointing.
and the likelihood is one assumes, andy, that you go home to the states, get it looked at by the people you know and trust, and then make a judgment from there?
12 months ago here or 11 months ago here it was your ankle, wasn't it?
is there anything about the court?
we know you're frustrated now but there is a lot of chinese fans frustrated out there, because we didn't see federer here and murray and now it's you. do you have anything to say for those chinese fans?
you have been in good condition in beijing and you were in the doubles. did you regret for the decision to play doubles in beijing?
your left knee injury is a new injury or an old one?
with the injuries, two top players that we've talked about, federer, murray, now yourself, and what we were talking about on monday, do you think the atp might start to notice these things?
did anybody speak to you about what you said yesterday to the atp?
he obviously poses a different threat than a lot of players. you must have been well pleased with the way you coped with it and imposed your own game today?
i was going to ask you, do you play him the same way you play karlovic? we might group them the same just because of height, but they're different, are they?
you've never been a player who sort of struggled for motivation, but when you come to the end of another kind of long and arduous year on the tour, what are your ambitions and desires looking ahead?
in february, i think it was, you dropped outside the top 100. since then it's been a strong upward curve. you must be pretty proud of where you are just outside the top 20 now?
what are you doing schedule-wise? are you going back to europe?
what would be a realistic target for next year?
but you very much think you have another grand slam in you?
can you remember this time last year what stage your rehab was, whether you're even running by now? and secondly, how are you going to build up for the oz? what are you going to play leading up to the oz?
i'm from new zealand. i'd just like to get your thoughts on the current state of australasian tennis, and can it get back to the glory days?
you always play against taller and bigger opponents, but do you feel the altitude of men's tennis getting even higher, to a new high in these recent few years, especially when we have a new grand slam champion around two meters now?
you played a match today with -- it's not a lot of rhythm in a match against a big guy like that. your next match, no matter what, will have a lot of rhythm whether it's monfils or mathieu. how do you work on the transition like that? because it's really two completely different matches. how are you going to prepare that and who would you prefer to play?
andy roddick was very outspoken in his opinion that the top players are playing too much tennis. is that something you agree with? and do you think your career might have panned out differently had you not had to play as much tennis as you have?
how did it feel out there? what did you make of it? what did you make of the match today?
the break that you had after the us open, is that something you think you'll continue as you're in the twilight of your career of your life? is that the kind of way you want to do it or was it forced on you?
a lot of the other players this week have talked about being tired and needing a rest. you seem very relaxed. it's working for you, the system?
it was quite interesting what you said before. you've been on the tour a long time, but you mentioned that it's always very hard to play against your fellow countrymen. i would have thought you're quite used to playing against them and it's not so hard anymore.
(in chinese.) so basically you played with becker in the doubles yesterday against chinese players, and this is the first time for the chinese players in this high-level masters. what's your comment on those chinese players?
just talking about your year, you mentioned you had a great summer, obviously the french open, that fantastic match with federer where you came very close. do you still have nightmares about that and how close you came to beating him and the circumstances of the match?
how did you feel tonight playing the local favorite? but half the stadium seemed to be cheering for you, so quite a strange situation?
but you had a good week in beijing and you seemed to get your rhythm tonight, especially in the second set?
how do you feel? everybody knows it's the farewell year this year, and you're getting a lot of attention because of that. how does that make you feel?
were you happy when you saw the draw when you saw who you were playing? i mean, no disrespect to anyone, but...
do you think that this could give you some confidence maybe to go a little more relaxed into round 2?
of course you're looking to win this tournament?
you've struggled this year to win back-to-back matches. do you think it could be different this week in shanghai? obviously you hope it will, but do you think it could be different?
i'm sure you've been asked this before this year, but how would you like to be remembered as a tennis player?
just now you compared your rival today with roger federer. would you give more comment on him?
22.
what are your feelings about this new masters 1000? and what are your thoughts about this -- you've seen the stadium a little bit. you've practiced the outside courts.
(through chinese translation) last week you played in china open, and you came to shanghai this week. what's your impression of beijing and shanghai? and also, shanghai masters cup is now changing to the masters 1000. what improvement have you seen in shanghai?
(through chinese translation) my question is what's your expectation of the forthcoming matches and basically what level would you like to reach?
(through chinese translation) just now roddick, at the press conference, voiced his complaints on the schedule of atp tournaments, and so basically you came all the way to asia to participate in the matches. what's your view on the schedules of atp tours?
good evening. you lost this match, but just now safin compared you to federer in terms of your characteristics in the match. and so what's your view on your gap with safin in this match?
so most of the audience come for safin, but you still received big applause from the audience. did you notice that?
shao-xuan zeng mentioned chinese have lack of opportunities to play with top players, and the atp masters 1000 will become a regular match. what role will it play to promote the performance of chinese players?
what are the biggest barriers to the development of chinese players?
safin is going to retire, so this may be your last match with safin. so what is his biggest impression on you?
i have two questions. the first question, in such a stadium, you played with a top player and did you feel nervous?
the second question: how did you score your performance?
yesterday shao-xuan mentioned that even though we lose, we should not lose too embarrassingly. i think you really did have some audience cheer for you, so how did you feel?
so before the beginning of the match, you practiced with shao-xuan zeng. what experience did he share with you?
so you two were very close at the very beginning, and then you got one serve break. how did you feel at that time?
you were not known to many people, and for example, when did you start to play and how many tournaments have you joined?
(in english) we see china dominating other sports like badminton and table tennis, the best in the world. what's the future for chinese tennis? can you one day be dominating in that sport?
(in english) is that with the female tennis or the male tennis?
in the second set, i noticed that safin dropped his racquet, so he was famous for throwing his racquet. did you notice that?
i noticed that in the second set, for example, you once argued with the chair umpire. what did you talk about with the chair umpire?
when do you think that you can join grand slam tournament?
shao-xuan zeng basically created his best rank this year. that happened last week. still he played most of his time in futures. for the chinese male players to advance, to join challengers or better tournaments, what do chinese male players need to do in addition to getting wildcards?
so whether chinese national team will have such a plan?
great win. when did you feel the momentum of the match really shifting?
do you feel as though you maybe towards, in the third set, you were maybe reading his serve a little better than the beginning?
can you just talk about -- i mean, it's a new situation having kelly here and everything. you've had brian's voice almost your whole life, your career. how that's going and why kelly? i know you were pretty close to him and he's in your area, but...
i guess it hasn't been the best year for you.
how do you put closure on it, coming to the end and looking forward to next year?
you know that marat safin has announced his retirement, and he's close to be 30, so i ask you as a generation mate of him, how do you think about his decision, and in general, how do you think about tennis after 30s?
to come back to this match with very little rhythm because of who you were playing, now you're going to go to a match with a lot of rhythm against rafa, is that a tough change? how are you going to prepare for that?
no matter what, a lopez was going to win today (laughter)?
considering your year, how important is it for you to play well these last few weeks of this year going to look forward to 2010?
you talk about points for next season, but there is a big rendezvous at the end of the year for you with the davis cup final. is that also something that makes you say, you know, i need to get confidence and get the matches?
what's your opinion on the injury of acasuso, that he quit the game?
yeah. what's your comment?
do you have any expectations of performers of shanghai masters series, expectations for performers?
good luck.
at 2-5, you seemed physically to pep up suddenly, and then you ran through it. what was happening there? you seemed a little lethargic before that?
you've won what people sometimes call the fifth grand slam. is this the most satisfying moment that you've had so far? secondly, does it give you a better chance of winning one of the four real grand slams?
how much do you feel your improvement is due to your improved fitness? and can you describe some of the fitness regimens you did at the university of miami in the summer?
can you talk about during the match, how do you feel the difference doing all that training?
do the players know that novak seems to have this problem over and over again? do you feel like if you get him to that certain point that you got him?
considering you didn't know when you arrived in america how you were going to be physically and therefore how that would translate onto the court, how satisfying is it to have got to two masters finals, and the only player that's beaten you is the world no.1?
now the clay season is starting. what are your expectations?
did you lose concentration when he called out the trainer?
you're a guy that obviously mixes it up a lot as far as pace and placement. is that particularly important against a guy like novak to do that?
is there a little bit of extra satisfaction to be the first british player to win this event?
it is for us. (laughter.)
what do you expect this year for your ranking?
when you closed out the eighth game with the world's slowest ace, 76 miles an hour, were you amused, or surprised?
was there an extra benefit to staying at home in your own place?
do you feel when you were serving for the second set that that was basically almost like match point?
obviously a tough match. at first it seemed like andy was really on and you were off. his passing shots were really tough. what was the most difficult thing you had out there to deal with?
you are you concerned about your problems with the heat? i mean, it shouldn't be happening to an athlete like yourself.
is that why you called the trainer?
trouble breathing again?
did you do medical examination for your abilities to stay in the heat?
you know the first player, pete sampras, had the problem with the heat, and he had some kind of anemia.
talk about andy murray. you mentioned the other day how much he's improved from a year ago to now. what's the difference?
particularly his defensive backhand. he turns that into offense so quickly. do you feel like you had good position at the net on some of those?
you felt poorly very early in the match?
obviously television is a factor, but do you think it's right to play in the hottest time of the day?
correct me if i'm wrong, i believe your family owns a new tournament in belgrade.
does that put a lot of pressure on you?
you sort of already answered this, but how pleased were you with your volleying, and have you been working on that?
have you been working on this a lot?
do you think the volley will make a comeback?
we've seen so much baseline, baseline, baseline. we're getting dizzy.
are you bringing it back?
which one of the clay court tournaments will you play at? belgrade and...
what did you do to train in the off-season?
where was the mountain?
what gave you most satisfaction about coming through this evening?
in the first set i think he won 14 points in the whole set. how does that set rank in terms of the best set you ever played?
was it your mindset that he had played three hours in his previous encounter and it might work in your favor?
have you ever felt this good going into a masters final?
how did you feel regarding the crowd? they were sometimes against you.
you've beaten djokovic in the past. do you think you have an edge over him in the final?
could you just take us through what you were thinking when he took his breather, so to speak, on the third breakpoint? you were in a great position to win the match, and he bends low for a volley and walks off and has treatment and you've got to wait until he comes back on. do you think's slightly against the spirit in which the game should be played?
what other sport can you stop it at such a really crucial juncture like that and have a seven-minute timeout for what looked like a rub, basically, on his thigh?
were you really pleased with how well you coped with that situation and served out so well for the match?
did you watch any of the federer/djokovic match?
did you have a wish for an outcome?
did it give you any insight on how djokovic might play on sunday?
obviously quite frustrated. it was 2-3 in the second seat set, about five breakpoints. you held at 4-2, and then after that it seemed like the wheels came off. couldn't keep the forehand on the court? any explanation? wind? focus?
when fired your racquet into the court, did that feel good?
do you remember the last time you broke a racquet, roger?
it was here?
it's obviously very tough for you to come in so soon after a defeat like that. the emotions are obviously very strained. is it getting tough to just appreciate the matches like this sort of drifting away? we watch them and we can't believe sometimes. i suppose it's even more difficult for you.
do you feel like he managed the win better than you did?
did you find yourself sort of pressing because of that and going for shots that you might have waited a little bit longer on?
how much pressure are you feeling out there?
how do you evaluate your play in the first part of the hardcourt season?
on the clay, you are only entered into two events prior to roland garros?
sorry?
is that set in stone, or might you change that?
did you feel like he almost let you back in at 4-love where he double faulted twice? did you feel there was a little opening there?
you've had other matches where things aren't going as well and you don't get as upset about that particular moment. what was different about today that you just lost it there for that moment?
do you feel you can overcome the problems you have at the moment, or you feel that you may need some help from a coach or from somebody else?
did you feel like the crowd got behind you after you smashed the racquet?
it seemed that you were not 100% today. is that right? you looked physically not very at ease. what happened?
what exactly happened? bad move?
what makes him so tough to play, do you think?
is this the kind of injury that will take time to recover?
were you tempted at all to retire completely?
if you are a 100% you will play the clay season? what will be the main goal for you, madrid or the french? both?
roland garros, what is the best way, according to you, to get prepared for this? to play a lot of matches?
have you already visited the new site in madrid?
you're usually a favorite here. have you ever heard a crowd pull for the other guy? was a lot of argentine fans out there.
did it affect you at all? it was just a wonderful match. how did you feel out there?
you came back very strong and won the second set. up two breaks in the third. what happened in that moment?
what was the problem for you? the feel of the ball or...
mentally hard, or...
did it kind of feel like a davis cup match to you?
40 some unforced errors and the whole tournament was kind of iffy. are you going to take a break?
two questions: what makes de potro so tough? obviously his serve and forehand are effective. and does indian wells carryover just eventually wear you down when you go to the finals every year at indian wells and win it and then come right here?
and del potro again, what makes him so effective?
how many days would you wish to rest before the clay court season in the ideal situation?
how many days will you rest before working?
are you mystified or puzzled by how you played during this tournament, or do you understand why you didn't play well and know what to do next?
pretty good. you happy with that?
what were you most pleased about in your game?
how good does it make you feel to have those two quick matches one after another given all the physical demands of these back-to-back championships?
is it hard to sort of keep your focus mentally when a guy takes such a long break between sets?
it was noted actually that you seemed to be humming along with the tune they were playing on the system. so you were very relaxed.
del potro is obviously on a high after beating nadal. he was out there for three hours. do you think that balances it?
when you play a guy of his kind of physique, is it a lot about trying to, as you say, put the ball in the most difficult place for him?
obviously your serve was dominant today: 85% on your first serve. is it tough to lose when you're serving like that?
is it tough to play i imagine a friend and countryman?
and djokovic is maybe not such a close friend. he beat you in the australian open, but since then, and he told us today, you've been tough. you've beaten him like four times in a row. what do you have to do to beat him again?
a lot of people say, and i see it too, you look like muhammad ali a lot in so many ways, from the way you smile and wink. have you ever met him? do you feel like you do look like him?
he's not a bad guy to copy though, one of the great athletes of all-time.
how did you feel out there?
is that something you're consciously trying to do?
specifically, how has losing that 15 pounds impacted your game the most?
how did you feel about all the french support?
yeah. do you enjoy the atmosphere?
do you like that? do you enjoy playing in that?
who tested your patience more, kuznetsova or monfils? must have been tough.
he's a tricky player, and as you said he does the rope-a-dope. you seemed really self-possessed today. did you feel that way today?
self-possessed.
you have to be pleased with your consistency. seems like match in and match out, you're really getting the job done and not letting your level slip too far.
given how raw and emotional you were, especially in the younger years, what kind of a journey has it been to get to this point where you can be out there so contained and so focused? was that a tough thing to do?
what is it like at the moment? the quarterfinal lineup is looking like a slam. it was the same at indian wells. you had a great australian open. what's it like to be in the mix currently at such an exciting time? people are saying it's a very exciting time for men's tennis.
how about taylor dent out there. they was on the eighth breakpoint when we walked in here. from what he's been through, are you surprised to see him out there?
on the other side the of draw: roger. it's always been a tough matchup. talk about that a little bit.
how about the fact that you beat him here last year on the same court and everything. does that factor in at all? can you remember that and bring that in, or not really?
are you doing yoga or something like that?
what do you think of alonzo's ceremony?
so you would have bet against him?
this tournament is a place where a lot of famous people come, shakira, celebrities. do you think that's fun for fans? i know sometimes they come to see you guys play. do you like that, too? have you met anybody that was kind of interesting or fun?
like with brooklyn, do a lot of people notice her? is that kind of a pain to her?
would you have rather had a really quick one like that than anything else?
you talked about playing well and playing smart. it was just that today, wasn't it? fifty eight minutes of playing well and playing smart.
i think you've got to go back to hamburg now for the last time that you didn't reach at least the quarters of a masters series. is that consistency the thing that pleases you most, the fact that there seems to be no letdowns these days?
when your opponent is imploding a little bit, is it difficult to sustain the levels of concentration that you need to do to keep him in that position?
when you see somebody getting down on themselves like he was and missing a fair bit, does that alter the way you approach the match? do you find yourself changing th way you deal with it?
is hawk-eye sort of so much a part of the game now, do you ever find yourself sort of reaching or asking for it on a court where it isn't available?
do you feel they're so integrated you find yourself going for it when it's not there?
why do you think guys are so poor in their success rate?
for quarterfinals, which player you prefer, verdasco or stepanek?
laura robson today has become world junior girl's no.1. probably not someone you see an awful lot of, but...
oh, okay. even better then. how good an effort is that at 15? does it kind of excite you that there's another british player possibly on the way up?
do you mind being on an outside court like that?
indifferent.
was that fifth game one of the more interesting of your career?
talk about the difference of playing his style. he has kind of a different style of play. what's that like to be across the court from him?
when you see the pressure he puts on you and how he wins points at the net and also inducing errors, does that make you reconsider how often you want to come in, do you think?
sort of like back to future or something like that?
next match will be against andy roddick. you have played against him many times. what do you expect this time?
have you got a chance to see any of andy's games? obviously you played him earlier this year. do you think it's benefitting his playing style? is he playing better because of how he's changed his game? more competitive?
on the subject him having changed his game over the years, do you think you'll have to change your game as the years advance and you get more challengers and more tough players?
obviously for years you were the hunted, no.1. do you enjoy the hunting, being on the opposite side of that? does it entail a change of mind or attitude in any way?
when you've had so much success against one player like andy roddick, does it give you the confidence that when you're in a tight game that you have what it takes to beat that player? you have a mental edge?
at this stage in your career, what do you consider to be more important to you: being no.1 in the world again or accumulating as many grand slams as possible?
was it as easy as it looked, or not?
is that what separates the top 10 from maybe the top 20, 25, the consistency? they all have the strokes, but it's just the consistency.
the other day you were saying that you were looking for confidence, in fact, this year. did you find it back, or you still need some more wins to be sure?
the next two, simon or tsonga, you've had great matches with both. they're two entirely different players. talk about the challenge each match would present.
have you found this a little bit of a strange year? because a lot of people are talking about obviously roger and rafa, and then there's almost an assumption that one day soon murray will be maybe no.3, no, 2, no 1. does that stiffen your resolve a little bit?
you've kind of grown up with electronic line calling the last three years. is it something you sort of take for granted now?
you've been more successful than any other top player.
yeah.
but does it seem like it's just part of the game now, it's integrated?
are you going to bring it to the serbian open?
the new racquet you have, you have mastered the feelings with the racquet, or you still have something to improve in the feelings you have with it?
can you explain the difference between the two?
you've got the same amount of prize money as the women's event here, but it's configured in different ways. if you were to win, you're actually going to earn less than the women because the distribution is different. are you happy with the way that the men's prize money is being distributed?
i understand that a lot of players did like you, which is to have their early training outside of serbia. is that the current trend? if so, why?
and now it's changing, or...
are you confident that everything will be ready on time for your tournament? i saw some pictures, and...
talk viktor troiki, your countryman. we don't know much about him.
have you helped him or mentored him in any way?
so you how did you feel out there in general?
andy says he lost like 15 pounds. do you see that in your future, as well?
after that match like that, how does your back feel?
have you adjusted anything in your game to make allowances for the back, or are you playing the same exact way?
how about that really long game? talk about that.
how about the one where he kept losing the breakpoints, eight or nine breakpoints?
do you feel that you're showing us some kind of tennis we've missed for so long?
are you going to try the clay and go to europe?
so we'll see you in england?
what did you know about your opponent before? he said he remembered one time many years ago when you were 14 and 15.
was it a harder first set than you thought it might be?
was it tough to get motivated today? looked like you were a little flat and listless out there.
any special reason why you didn't feel good?
nothing physical?
what do you think turned the match in your favor today?
you play all over the world. can you sense how popular you are in south florida when you're here?
why do you think that is?
it seemed like you were playing very deep on the court today, and you've been doing so well on hard courts by playing inside the court. was that part of problem, and did you fix that as the match went on?
were you ever a junior player here in the junior tournament or a ball kid or spectator at this stadium?
here.
no junior orange bowl or anything?
we've had hawk-eye around for a few years now. most of the top players, their percentage is quite low. you're 36% for getting it correct. i'm wondering, why is that? what do you think of electronic line calling?
are you a bad loser? do you sleep well after a loss, or do you say it's just tennis and it's okay? i mean, how are you after a loss?
and that was always that way? even when you were younger, no problem?
clay season is coming up. are you looking forward getting back on the dirt again?
what did you make of that?
you said in the past it's just a case of really getting through these earlier rounds and that sometimes it might not be pretty. but if you're in the fourth round, that is what it's all about.
did you tailor what you did specifically to him? you didn't seem to give him much pace, for instance.
you said you lost concentration at the end. in hindsight, have you any idea why?
no.
can you recall the last time a guy served four successive doubles against you?
the three in the 4-all and then the first game of the second set he served a double, as well.
with both these opponents, did you have the sense that both of them could wobble mentally at certain times of the match, and it was a question of drawing the sting and waiting for them to mentally get a bit shaky?
obviously in the off-season you did a lot of training and got really fit, and so it fernando verdasco. did you notice anything different about fernando when you played him earlier this year, or maybe in the few years past? did he improve any way mentally, physically in your opinion?
we think you're playing on the grandstand tomorrow against troicki. i think it's safe to say you've had a couple of indifferent performances out there. is it much different playing in the boondocks compared to on center?
you've played troicki once before?
what do you anticipate the match is going to be like?
playing taylor dent. are you surprised that he's back and everything that he's been through? he said that he remembers beating you in the juniors.
you owe him now, right?
no, he was out. he was in a body cast and all that.
what were the circumstances of your matchup? what do you remember about when you played him in the juniors?
at that time you were known for your temper. did you have any kind of meltdown or anything in that match?
he said he had a meltdown in that match.
can you ever allow yourself a little bit of empathy when you play someone like that when they've come back from being off, they were in a body cast, or is that not even in your head?
you talked a little bit at indian wells about fatherhood, and a handful of men have won majors being a father, but not too many at the u.s. open and wimbledon where you've had the most success. have your thoughts evolved on that at all since then? mirka is such a big part of your team. she's going to be preoccupied. how do you think that might play out?
but tennis is a selfish endeavor. you have to focus on yourself. with a kid...
after this miami tournament, you will be reaching the clay season. will you be preparing a different way to perhaps have your first french open?
jo-wilfried tsonga. i have a question how a player goes from being dangerous in the draw to breaking through to the next level.
when you go out to meet an opponent now, or prepare for one, you've won so much, for you, are you thinking, i really want to beat this guy. is it the competition, or is it for you now about execution? i would like to do this with my game. do you still feel that sort of hunger? i just want to beat this guy? do you understand what i mean?
you talked about your preparations for paris. when you've won australia, it seems like there has been a lot more conversation about that because of the grand slam and, you know, you've been so close the last few years. is it fair to say that you've sort of compartmentalized paris a little bit more this year? you've put it away more in the background than you have maybe in the last few years?
just in terms of not thinking about it before? you really need to think about it?
how do you feel? it looks like you're maybe one game away. federer would be your next match.
what was exactly your injury, and when was the last surgery?
when was that?
how long did you spend in bed?
march what year?
this little run through south florida seems like you got the matches you wanted, and now biggest win today, obviously. how good do you feel?
your wife/coach, right?
when you were in the body cast, were you thinking at that point you'd be out here again maybe facing roger federer on center court? did you believe that that was going to happen?
they said no to you, and then you start coming back. there must have been a point where you think, well, there is a chance after all.
and playing roger on stadium court?
talk about that.
do you remember the match?
where was that?
you're sure you're not going to play the clay court season? you want to get back in better shape?
you said you're applying things now that you wished -- what are some of those?
you mean like when you flipped the racquet the other day and hurt your hand?
do you think that the fact that you're a rare breed as a serve and volleyer, do you think that's going to give you an edge when you get yourself to the fitness level you want?
during your tv time, did you make commentary on roger's matches?
did you have to change your serve, or not?
same serve as before?
how has your life changed since you helped to win the davis cup and played this great match at the australian open? has your life changed?
are you more popular in spain now, like people approach you on the street everywhere?
how did you think you played today?
can you talk a little bit about your decision to go to vegas and work out with andre and gil and darren and how that has helped you?
is this informal? is it a paid thing? like is darren going to be your coach at all, or is it part-time?
seems to be working. you're playing at a really intense level. looks like you're on a mission. at 25 years old -- you're now in the top 10. what more do you hope to accomplish?
is it important for to you continue to rise up through the rankings? do you see yourself being no.1?
have they helped you mostly, gil and andre, with conditioning or technical things about your game? seems like right now you could outlast anyone stamina-wise.
has it been tough following rafa? i mean, you're older than him, obviously. has it helped drive you to see what this kid has done so young and say, hey, why not me?
as a left-handed player, how did you feel like to play against right-handers? is it an advantage? you feel like that?
when you were in las vegas you said that you worked on some spirituality. describe a little bit about that.
spirituality.
did i mishear?
towards the end of last year, especially after the olympics, you seemed to be serving and volleying a lot more than you did in the beginning of the year. i saw you come to net a couple times today. is that a more concerted effort to not come to net right now, or you really haven't decided how to play out 2009?
how did you feel out there overall?
with no disrespect to kevin, were you working on certain things, like chipping and charging out there, serving and volley?
are you as comfortable with your game right now as you were after you beat andy at the us open last year?
you've just won the stefan edberg award for the fifth consecutive time, which is a wonderful achievement. does it get any harder with all the stress that life places upon you and everybody to keep up such high standards of deportment as time goes by? does it get harder to behave so well?
on court?
you reminded us about your health last year, your back and the mono. do you think in general people have been too quick to count you out, too quick to sigh, well, that was great while it was lasted. let's move on to the next guy? do you feel like you've been counted out too quick?
how are you getting along with the challenge system lately? what's your batting average last few months?
have you warmed up to it at all? i know you had reservations early on. what are your thoughts about it at this point?
how do you feel here in south florida with latin people around you? do you speak a little spanish?
colombia?
could you say hi to colombia for me?
i know you've got to stay in the here and now and this tournament, but i'm just wondering whether you ever have any thoughts towards wimbledon and the fact that the last time you were there was an incredible day but a tough day for you.
i imagine it's something that's a big ambition for you again this year.
i have one question going back to the australian open. probably not a great memory, but in the trophy ceremony, all those emotions that came out, now that you can reflect on it a little bit, what were you feeling? what was all that emotion about? what were you feeling at that moment?
how's it feel out there?
what's it take to win out here for you? what do you think it's going to take for you to keep this going, to keep winning out here?
where do you place this tournament worldwide? let's say after the majors in terms of the fanfare of events.
can you think of another tournament where you get to promote your game as much as you get to promote here at the sony ericsson, doing whatever it can be, going to the sea aquarium, whatever?
do you have a preference between grandstand and stadium court? obviously normally you're on stadium.
is there a different feeling in the men's game today as opposed to a year ago when everybody was chasing federer, and now he comes off of five losses to murray, he's not beating nadal?
do you sense or do the players kind of talk about even the sense of a different persona about roger now at all?
do you sense he doesn't have the confidence he used to at all, or not?
you do have in the next round tomas berdych or mikhail youzhny. with whom will you feel more comfortable against?
do you wonder sometimes about the need for changing, like you just said, the masters 1000, then the masters series. people are calling it the super 9. do you wonder what's the point and whether you're confusing the public on that?
when you talk about roger federer, the fact he's no.2 and that some people are saying, oh, his game has been off and what have you, is that dangerous to do with a guy that's been this good for this long, to start talking about the holes in his...
do the players at all talk about the impact, possible impact, of the financial crisis on sponsors? because i'm just picturing the open, the billboard at the open with all the sponsors, all the new york banks, lehman brothers and the like. i don't know what's going to happen this year.
andy and mardy are going to play dwyane wade in horse on sunday. i just wonder how you would handicap that matchup.
you and john hanging out, walking down the street. he's saying people are coming up to you bothering you about your height and basketball. what's that like when you're hanging together?
what do you say?
he says he tells them he plays chess or water polo.
well, you did play hoops, and you're a clippers fan. was there ever a decision to choose?
anyone we heard of who went on?
he talked about how he grew seven inches when he was 17. when was your spurt?
so was it movement, was that your problem?
your dad plays baseball?
he could take you one on one, he said.
you haven't done it yet?
that would be a good one.
talk about difficulties and advantages of being a tall tennis player. i don't think there has ever been a grand champion who has been as tall as either one of you. tell me what you think the other pluses and the minuses?
is there a difference in the mindset because you always feel you can rely on your serve?
that upsets you, i think.
do you have trouble with the wind, particularly here you're on an island?
do you feel you could have an intimidating factor when you're playing like a rochus or one of these little guys who are foot and a half shorter than you?
what do you have to do to get to the next level, sam? obviously john had the big breakthrough a few years ago. he said he lost his confidence last year. you've had your spots, too. what has to be done?
when you get your racquets from the company, how much adjustment do you have done to it?
do you know where...
is your coach like mcenroe? davis cup team? do you have a private coach?
separate?
how about john's?
is it disappointing for you, because of andy and james and maybe even mardy that there's not necessarily a spot for you on the davis cup team?
you and john join forces.
did the bryan brothers give you grief about losing?
you feel you could be a formidable team? big serves?
was that your best result?
back in the day, people played davis cup because they were playing for their country and just for expenses. nowadays, i mean, the americans are getting big bucks. some other countries don't have that much, but they have to fork over something. what's your take on that? do you think the players should just be playing for the love of their country and taking expenses that weekend, or should they get paid because they're working? do you have any feel on that?
do you think it would be hard for them to get some of the stars playing if they were just paying expenses?
it's a big check.
good match.
seems like you're riding a little wave of confidence. you've had some nice matches. talk about indian wells and what that brought to this tournament.
you're probably sick of the height questions. you and sam are playing back to back here. two young american hopefuls. the players are getting bigger and bigger. i'm wondering, in your estimation, how has your height helped you, and how has it hurt you as far as tennis technique, things like that?
the volleying technique, staying low in the low ones at net? that's the tough one?
when did the growth spurt come? were you ever torn between basketball and tennis, or was it always tennis?
whoa.
how tall are they are?
how did that affect your shoes, your knees aching?
what did the shoe size go, from what to what?
that's not bad.
did basketball coaches like just want you? senior year in high school, college...
what college did you end up going to?
dog. you look at march madness, do you say, hey, man, i could be there? well, georgia is not there, but do you feel like you should be there?
what's the key going to be against ferrer? he has a really good return of serve, obviously. i think you're 0-1.
there are so few breaks of serve in a lot of matches you play. i think you were down a break in the last set of your final qualifying match. how did you just stay mentally into it and fight back?
are you and sam tight maybe because of the things you have in common?
who wins one-on-one basketball?
you had the breakthrough a few years ago when you first came up, and kind of really got a little quiet the last few years. what has happened? what needs to happen for you to like make an impression?
how?
what are your plans for the clay court season? what are your thoughts? it's not an ideal surface for you, but i think in the french open you were up two sets over chela.
when you and sam are hanging out, do people come up to you and say, what nba team do you guys play for? do you get silly comments like that?
how about the nba question?
in miami?
are you just sick of those height questions?
what's your response?
have you got a choice in the ncaa?
what killed you?
you have to go big east.
it's been a long time since we've been in this room with you not as a winner. i know on this end it feels very strange. talk about the experience tonight and the way juan martin played.
how disappointing is this not to get no.6?
what happened in that fifth set, the first three games?
did he do anything differently today than he did in prior matches?
can you look back five years ago and think about how he must be feeling as he's lying on the court after match point?
you seemed to get disturbed about the length of time he was taking to take the challenges. talk about what was going on with the conversation with the umpire.
was that a lot of distraction for you?
how do you look back at the grand slam results of this year? you got two titles of grand slam, two finalists. how did you look back?
with all the good that's happened this year, will that eventually help ease the sting of this?
you were fully in control early on, and then the match start to change. was there a moment where you said, uh-oh, i got to get more serious or things aren't going the way i need them to go?
would you say this defeat, looks like a little bit the one you had in australia with nadal?
down.
are you at all surprised that he was able to keep his composure and not get sucked up by the moment of his first major final?
your play is pretty much revered across the sport. the vibe inside the stadium was to pull for the underdog. do you notice it and how did to feel to be on the other side?
could you talk about his forehand, just talk about it and how it compares to other big forehands on the tour.
the other ones, you've spoken highly of gonzlez's forehand. who are the others, the better ones?
so far rafa is the only one to defeat you in a major final. how do you feel about this other name coming into that list?
seemed like a little turning point in the second set, there was that call on the line that was challenged. seemed look you thought it was maybe another mark there. can you talk about that?
it's very tough to lose a grand slam final, but looks to me that maybe this one you didn't express your feelings of losing. the last ones were australia, wimbledon, you didn't take it so sad.
you mentioned before the us open that you probably will have a better idea how it is like to travel with a family on the tour. have you got a better idea now? have you got time to think about your approach to next year?
when you look back at this, how will this strengthen your resolve now?
to get back and win the aussie.
could you just describe the difficulties of the match today?
to what degree did your stomach injury affect you today and in this tournament?
on what shots did your abdominal hurt you the most?
as disappointing as you have to feel today, you must have a real proud moment, as well, knowing you've reached this far after this tough road. there are some positives to take out of this, right?
how would you assess del potro's chances tomorrow, especially if he played roger? i think he's 0-6 in his career against roger. if he plays like this, does he have a chance?
he's beaten you three straight times now. what's changed or what makes his game so difficult for you, especially recently?
do you leave here frustrated?
when it comes to the big points, and maybe the match like today does not really go that well, how do you approach the big points?
how long do you have to rest now because of the injury? how long do you have to rest?
is there any point at which you considered not playing? how much pain would there have to be? would you play no matter what? was there any point when maybe you thought you would not play or you were going to play even with the pain?
three times, right there at the edge. you've got him. he has a chance. he doesn't come through. what's the difference right there at 6-6, 6-5, 6-5 in all three sets?
quick question and a follow-up. the quick one is, was that the shot of your life?
the follow-up: novak said in the press conference he senses as an opposing player a calmness in you that he attributes to the fact that maybe now that you are now a dad and you have the records behind you, you've reached those thresholds in life and in your career, and then i asked him to say, to clarify if that's really what he meant, and he said, yeah, it is, but you'd have to ask him. so i'm asking you.
yeah, he's using me as a conduit.
so let me about the conduit.
rafa wanted me to ask you...
seriously. are you having fun? sometimes you get caught up in the emotion. do you think you have a chance tomorrow?
but are you having fun?
actually, following up on your paris match, you played five sets in paris. what is different in terms of your game and in terms of del potro's game right now compared to when you played that last match?
at wimbledon you had a warmup suit signifying how many grand slams you won.
do you plan or is anyone planning for you a new number on a new warmup suit?
i know you probably don't think about the ball boys too much, but there is a guy named harry villaril (ph) who has been the ball boy in every one of your finals here, and he'll probably be the ball boy tomorrow.
is he a good luck charm? can you relate to the ball boys at all? were you ever a ball boy growing up as a kid?
he'll be the guy with two black knee braces on.
earlier in your career it seemed like you had some tough losses here, some struggles getting adjusted to the environment, the noise, the planes, new york. was there anything that changed for you in the city, any match at the open that changed maybe your momentum?
many players seem to be rushing to get married. not many have twins. do you think it's a problem?
all the competitors want to get married because they improve apparently. you played better since you're a father.
the real question is another one. we like to see you very much in italy playing, but are you coming to play davis cup in italy? at this moment what are the percentages?
i think it's probably tomorrow.
what do you know about big bill tilden besides the fact he won six straight here? how much reading of his tennis history do you do, if any?
what are your observations of the kim clijsters' story, and what are your thoughts about what she's accomplished here?
and what were your thoughts on what happened last night with serena williams?
i know that cbs and nike executives aren't happy that mr. nadal won't be your opponent tomorrow. is there a letdown you won't be facing him? you guys are like phil mickelson and tiger woods, arnie and jack.
the great legendary player, jack kramer, has just passed.
he really was a founder of pro tennis, the atp, a great player, sold incredible amount of product for your sporting goods company. could you talk about his incredible contributions to the game? and what kind of contacts did you have with jack?
you've played five different players the last five years, and tomorrow you're getting a sixth different one. all the players are from different generations, actually. does that give you some extra perspective about how consistent you are?
going for no.15 and the stress of that and what you've accomplished, is this a little different feeling inside? you have the record now. of course a slam is a slam, but is it different, or no?
is that guy a god or just a genius?
i know you did just say you didn't play your best, but you certainly played with your heart out there. do you sort of feel that if you played any other human being in the world out there today the way you played that you'd be sitting here the victor?
was that shot almost a metaphor for the match, the one at the end through the legs? was that almost a metaphor for the match?
what about your reaction? you've had several fun reactions. here you're in the semis and you're having so much fun. how are you able to do that? it didn't look like you had much pressure on you.
everyone likes to talk about your nice games, but there was one game when you were up 4-2 that you played terrible.
but also many times when you lose the point or that you're in trouble you look to your corner, where federer doesn't do that. don't you think that you look a little bit more unsecure [sic] because of that? i mean, it's like you're not really convinced that you can do it. every time you get close, and then something happens.
novak, on court today you obviously had some moments of resignation, what can i do? but also in your career you've beaten roger and you've won a slam and you're ranked highly. do you feel a fire that you can be no.1, or is it a little bit of an acceptance that just i'm playing in the roger federer era and it's kind of tough?
if the tennis gods came to you and said, novak, please, please, give us one weakness in roger federer's tennis game, what would that be?
as someone who has won a slam and knows what it takes, how deep now do you think the tour is in players who can win a slam? has del potro moved up into that category? is murray still in it?
as great as you are, do you ever look across...
but looking over the net at roger, are you ever amazed at his consistency and what he can continue to do?
does it hit your brain at all? did you think about that?
before you said that none of you two played at his best today. what in your opinion today federer didn't play at his best? what was missing more than you expected?
i lost count of the number of times you challenged correctly. how grateful were you to have the replay system, and how concerning is it that so many calls were...
a lot of people would suggest that as a player gets older and they have children, you know, family and maybe they've got the records and things behind them that perhaps maybe they become complacent. and yet you suggested earlier that you think that roger has actually developed perhaps a calmness about him as a result of that.
so do you think that that mindset, having the records behind him and...
maybe you should get married. (laughter.)
since you're in new york anyway, you seem to be a student of the game as well as being a great player. are you going to come here tomorrow to watch the final?
you're leaving new york in a different relationship with the fans than you left last year, and that's been, i think, a really conscious and admirable effort on your part. do you think you understand more now what part of your job involves sort of almost a responsibility to be a performer in that sense, to have a bond with fans, no matter where you are in the world, whether it's new york or paris or london or anywhere?
does the prospect of playing two more days in a row given your physical condition give you any pause?
you're very used to having to play very long matches over considerable number of days. how difficult was this one to cope with all the stops and starts?
last year when you lost, you seemed very weary, very tired here. are you better rested now?
how different are you now than when you played del potro last time? were you very rusty last time? are you a better player, fresher now?
last night, did you want to wait longer to play, or were you happy that they canceled it at 6:00?
you were only out there about 34 minutes today. was that enough of a workout for you? will you even practice more today?
what would you say is the best thing that del potro does? what is the biggest challenge he presents to you?
did you practice yesterday at all?
as a very prominent player in the game, do you ever have conversations with the authorities here about the scheduling? are you able to talk to them about the schedule and whether you think it's fair or not fair?
for everybody. are you able to talk to them and ask them...
how would you describe your physical condition right now compared to when you began the tournament?
would you prefer the early match tomorrow or the later match?
have you told them that?
at 4-5, breakpoint, you were sort in control of the point and then a bag went flying across the court and called a let. were you cursing that bag? the other night, you were in control of the point and a bag came across. you slapped your racquet. you were mad. were you cursing that bag that night?
you were hitting a lot of short balls. does this have anything to do with your stomach muscle?
hitting short balls, does the stomach affect that?
how would you describe what the career grand slam means to you?
was your worst rain experience two years ago in wimbledon?
can you tell us what happened at 3-1 in the second set? just seemed to fall apart. was it him raising his game or your game falling down, or a little of both?
i know it's very short after the match, and i'm sure you're feeling disappointment, but are you able to at least appreciate how far you got in this tournament?
it's only your second time here and you've accomplished what you've accomplished. can you feel pretty good about the tournament in general?
is there something that was working for you against andy? i mean, different players, obviously. do you feel you had something working for you when you played andy that maybe wasn't there today?
what was the weather like that out there? it was windy. was it affecting play today?
you played against del potro in australia and play again today. what can you say about his game?
so you did break through to best eight this time. to go to the next level, what do you think you need?
you said that you spend one week before in new york, and that you were talking to somebody or talking yourself into improving the game. could you tell us more about it? were you here by yourself practicing one week before the tournament, or was your coach here with you?
with your coach?
i thought you said that the two of you had long talks, you know, where your game is at and how to improve it.
well, you played terrific game, not today because the weather was so awful.
you played terrific tennis here, so i'm wondering what has changed.
how good is it to be back in the semifinal of a grand slam?
we saw andy murray yesterday come up a little bit flat. didn't have much game to bring. were you concerned about that in your game today? you struggled a little bit there in the second set today?
when he's on one of those hot streaks and playing at his highest level, what is your philosophy? do you sit back and wait, or do you feel you have to react to that and do something different?
i understand you've been hosting children of 9/11 victims in your box. can you talk about that, what that means to you, how it got started.
do they know who you are and what you've done on the court? do they know you for your impressions or more for your tennis?
when you say that you don't want to talk about it or you haven't wanted to talk about it, do you mean you don't want to make it seem like it's a publicity thing, make it genuine from the heart?
i think when you responded to that question you said, you know, i obviously haven't wanted to talk about it.
maybe it's just from the outside, but you seem more relaxed in this tournament than you've been. is there any reason, or do you feel more relaxed?
at the end of the match you pointed to your box. how important is having your coaches during the last few weeks?
with the boos that you heard here last year after the roddick match and all that, have you made an effort this year to get the crowd on your side? are you trying to work with them, like the mcenroe thing the other night, just trying to get them behind you this year?
when you get deep into a slam, how do you find that balance between the work you do between the matches? who makes that call? is it you? is it marian? who makes the call about the amount of time you do spend preparing?
my name is angela buxton, and i've written a book called 303 tips for successful tennis players, together with a serbian tennis coach called nesa simic, who i believe you might know.
it is due for publication, which includes serbia as well as worldwide early next year. as the leading serbian tennis player, i would be very grateful if you could say something encouraging to young serbian players and worldwide that would encourage them that could be used in the book.
you are playing so well in this time, and the way you're walking on the corridor seeing all these ex-champion's photos, are you inspired by these photos?
you kind of joked the other night when someone asked you about your relationship with todd. what, you don't think that we make a good couple? can you just talk a little bit about how different your personalities are? i mean, he seems quite serious, at least with a dry sense of humor. what you have learned from him in the time you've worked with him?
is there one specific area, besides the mental game, but one thing that perhaps even you're surprised he's helped with?
even though you won today, you looked sometimes frustrated by your game. next round you may face the perfection of federer. what do you wish to improve, would like to improve, between the two rounds?
what do you wish to make better for the next round?
you seemed to be having trouble with your left wrist. is there a problem? and if so, has it arisen today or has it been ongoing?
the hand was bothering you on the return, is that what you're saying?
usually you can, on days like this, find a way to win. what was the reason for not being able to do that today?
considering how well you've been playing this summer on hardcourts, does this make it all that much more difficult to take, this early exit?
can you comment on his game, the way he played, because you have had experience playing him before? is this the best you've seen him?
this is the end of the grand slam season for you, obviously. i know you just came off the court, but stepping back, how would you assess the season? what are your thoughts on the season as a whole?
your body language seemed pretty flat for you. is that as a result of sort of the wrist thing bugging you at the back of your mind?
patrick mcenroe said on commentary that you mentally went away in the second and third sets. is that a harsh comment?
there were some people that were picking you to win this tournament coming in. did you ever feel any pressure or expectations on you?
will the wrist affect your davis cup, or is that too soon to talk about that?
what did he do particularly well today? was there anything that surprised you at all?
were you kind of surprised you didn't find a way out of it and felt a bit flat despite this being your favorite tournament?
would you say this is the biggest disappointment of your career so far?
when a big point is lining up and it doesn't play out on your favor, how do you deal with it on the court to get back in the game or motivate yourself? how do you deal with that?
when you do look back, andy, what do you think the one or two things you'll learn from this us open and this match?
do you know what the wrist problem is exactly?
incredible result today taking out one of the hottest players from the summer season. you must feel tremendous about your accomplishment today.
this is your first grand slam quarterfinal?
that's quite an accomplishment.
you're facing now a player who i think you've played him in australia, if i'm not mistaken.
he's been playing tremendous tennis. your thoughts on a quarterfinal match coming up?
by blockade, do you mean the blockade in your head? did that service break at the end of the first set to go to 6-5 get you over that?
that service break to go to 6-5 in the first set, what did that mean to you there?
what happened the last two sets? what happened with your game? how did it click?
were you surprised that he wasn't more consistent? because you've played him a bunch of times. you just hit steady. he made a lot of unforced errors.
you beat him when he was a junior, and then you lost three times in a row as a pro. does having a result as a junior mean something after many years?
where were you when goran won wimbledon in '01?
you were not by chance at that wild parade when he came back and they were ripping off his clothes and trying to get souvenirs?
can you describe what it was like being a croatian tennis player, still pretty young, but you were a player at that point.
thinking maybe it would be your turn one day?
how did he help you?
what makes bob a great coach, do you think?
were you in zagreb when croatia beat the united states?
yeah.
and then you became part of beating the united states?
those are highlights, i imagine, for your career.
going to win the cup?
were you affected at all by the war when you were young?
what were your feelings coming into the tournament? your results were somewhat a bit up and down. how were you feeling confidence-wise coming into the us open?
but you also came back from two sets down against levine. how did you turn that around?
are you working in san remo or some other place?
how much time would you say you're in croatia?
how much time are you in croatia every year? few weeks, or more than that?
how would you describe the tennis in croatia right now this year?
when you were here four years ago, there was a whole bunch of boys with you from croatia. what happened to them?
yes. your generation.
did you call your family already?
do you speak fluent italian?
your great grand slam season is continuing. i guess the flip side is you keep running into a certain someone in your quarter. can you talk about that? are you tired of seeing roger looming ahead of you?
i think most of us would tend to look at your win against rafa in paris as a big turning point. but for you, did it really happen that way, or was it more of a gradual, lead-up process?
your work with magnus, how is that evolving? i know it was sort of a fresh start for you. are you now in a position where you weren't really refining things so much as reminding yourself of how to continue to play well?
the match today, despite nikolay retiring, how did you feel out there? how did you feel with your own game?
did he give you any indication that he was hurting? was it a surprise when he suddenly...
i have a question about doping. how many times have you had an out-of-competition test this year? how are you adjusting to the whereabouts requirements?
have things changed for you much? i know you haven't been home much probably but have things changed for you there with the season? you've come out of anonymity more and been more recognized and more appreciated by your home fans?
i know some of our american players get really tired of being asked, are you the next so-and-so, agassi, sampras, whatever. you're probably the target of those questions now, i would imagine. does it ever get tiresome?
you started very well in the first set. what was working for you early on?
did you change the way you played in the second, try to be more aggressive, or was it him stepping up?
what did you say at 5-1 when there was a challenge?
how do you feel right now? what is the primary emotion?
the way he was counterpunching today...
with the way you like to play, when you find yourself back there a lot, does it get frustrating?
from the time you got mono, how long did it take till you felt a hundred percent physically, or do you still...
did you lose a lot of weight?
were there any residual effects, physical or mental, after the roddick match?
when you got into a baseline rally with him, did you have a lack of confidence that you could win the point?
what do you need to do to get to the next level?
and zero points to defend?
what sort of statement do you feel the u.s. men made in the open here?
did you know and/or care that you were the last american?
looking ahead to the indoor season, your biggest results have come in the states. how important is it for you to start getting big results overseas?
why do you think your biggest results have come in the states? is it a comfort factor?
jesse witten was talking about the expenses of traveling on the tour, how much money it costs to play. when you first came on the tour, did you have sponsors or was it financing a dream on a credit card?
did you draft matthew stafford into your fantasy team?
he was named the starter today.
how confident are you in the hawk-eye system?
everything worked very well today for you except for the dropshot.
you lost two.
talk about what made the first set so difficult.
you're coming to the net more and more. any motivation for that?
is it true that you play chess as a preparation for a game?
yes.
what about playing soderling?
before your match was the oudin match. perhaps you got to see it a bit. what observations do you have of the way melanie oudin is playing and conducting herself?
any specifics about the way she plays that particularly impressed you?
one more win and it will be 22 straight semifinals in slams. even at 21, are you almost as proud of that as winning 15?
having seen up close what mirka has gone through the last several months with pregnancy and motherhood, what do you think about what kim has done here coming back and playing as she has?
it's the 40th anniversary of laver's grand slam in 1969. can you to talk about that, winning two grand slams, '62 and '69, put that in perspective.
you have 11 victories against soderling so far. what has he improved? the last games have been a little bit close. what has he improved since you started to play him 11 times ago?
is it fair to say at this point with the streak going so well you're playing more out of instinct than you were in the beginning of the year?
what has been your favorite thing to do with the twins? how are your diaper-duty-changing skills?
you're hands-on?
talk about you and genova, playing davis cup. do you remember anything?
when you were a child?
how do you keep motivated to go out and beat hewitt, beating him 13 times in a row, undefeated against robredo and soderling? what gets you motivated for the matches?
how important is it to specifically work on footwork exercises? is it just natural talent?
robin says you basically don't have any weaknesses. how do you feel about your own game? do you have any weaknesses?
what are your impressions so far of the atp's new ceo? what do you think his priorities should be in that job?
what was different this year as opposed to past us opens?
to make it to the round of 16.
what did the doctor say about your injury? are you worried for the next matches?
how motivated are you by the fact this is the only grand slam tournament you've never won? was that a factor in deciding to come back for this tournament?
was it a factor at all in deciding to come back?
that you've never won.
you said you didn't want to talk about injuries. was that your knee or the abdominal situation?
can you at least talk about how you felt after you got the treatment for the rest of the match?
so outside of the serve, where did you feel your level was today?
nicolas was playing very tough, especially in the first set. you had problems closing it down. how do you feel about that?
if you play monfils, can you talk about that matchup, what you have to do.
near the end he hit a shot that went into the net and he threw his shirt over his head and got a laugh. what was your reaction to that?
when he hit the ball into the net. he put his shirt over his head then smiled at the crowd.
we are used to see you much more cheerful, especially after a win. today you answer as if you're not happy.
in the last game, 30-15 and the ball went into the net. most players get angry, but you laughed. you put the shirt over your head. it was a great crowd-pleasing moment. is sense of humor part of your personality and game for success?
what were your impressions of nadal today?
once he took the injury timeout at 2-1 in the third set, after that, did that play on your mind? were you trying to make him run more or anything like that? did that affect your game at all?
but did that affect your game from that point on?
novak said after, on court, that it was hard to tell by your match who was no.4 out there. did you ever feel that way?
were there moments where you were thinking, i'm with this guy? you forget he's no.4?
wonderful adventure is over. how do you reflect on it?
these are always unfair questions.
understanding that you haven't had a whole lot of time to reflect, but is this a potential career changer for you?
what were those people yelling in the stands? we were all trying to figure it out.
sounded like j something?
do you have any idea how many college friends, family members all were here today?
when you talk about measuring yourself against these top guys for a couple of matches and feeling like you can hang in there, does it also help you identify, hey, i've got to work on this specifically?
you said even on the court that you were talking about retirement earlier this year. now is that completely out the window, or are you thinking, now that i've done this, this proves that i should keep going?
can you tell us just a little bit on the financial piece, do you have like a clothing sponsor? a shoe sponsor? a racquet provider and all that?
so nike contract was both shoes and clothes?
may i ask your shirt? i can't see a logo.
it is?
bought it like at sports authority or something?
was there ever any football in your background?
has adidas or k swiss or fila...
you had double faults at a couple crucial points.
is it hard to keep your enthusiasm when those points, had to surrender the points like that?
what's your next tournament that you're scheduled to be in?
how do you think that will be? to go from this, from louis armstrong, to that?
did you hear you're a youtube sensation now? you are tangentially involved because it was a match with bruno.
was there like a best perk of playing in this tournament for you that you're going to miss, you know, back on the challengers?
that doesn't happen elsewhere?
is this your first visit here?
how is the tournament going for you so far?
when you assess the competition, how do you see it going forward?
between the two of you today you hit 101 unforced errors. how do you feel about the level of play in this match?
was he playing as well as you expected him to?
what happened in the fourth set?
did you say it was a strange match?
heart a little broken right now?
when you were down two sets, what did you do at that point to bring yourself back?
with all this variety to your game, does his style of play take you out of that?
what about his net play? has that improved?
were you surprised he hung with you in the fifth set?
do you think he did anything differently or better than when you played him in d.c.?
you talked a lot about his size. how much of his defense really impressed you?
is it at all hard to accept when a guy that you've been a little bit of a mentor to beats you on a big stage like this?
what do you think the very young andy roddick would think of roddick and the career he's had?
pretty good ride?
did you break the momentum after winning the fourth set?
i think you only serve-and-volleyed one time.
how hard is this? you came in playing so well, expectations going really deep in this tournament. how hard is it?
can you take stock at all with your grand slam season yet?
there were people within isner's camp who said he was inspired by your conditioning, taking your career seriously. any thoughts on that?
you ended up saying you were energized by losing a marathon against roger in wimbledon.
ultimately, weren't you, though?
will this be any different? will you feel any differently about this?
you walked right off the court really quick. what were you feeling at that point?
what caused you to do that, though? sadness? anger? what's the emotion at that moment?
the tiebreak has been such a good friend to you this year. do you feel like you were a little too passive in those two breakers?
how do you like his chances against verdasco?
what you took out of the reaction in wimbledon, you said it was perspective. considering how unusual his game is, what can you take out of this?
sluggish start. thoughts overall?
i know it's a bad day right now, but do you feel the ascension of your game continued in this open?
he's obviously a very good player. anything in particular about his game that you can't quite put your finger on?
the flatness?
overly technical, but when you played nadal here last year, after the first set, you flattened out your forehand. that's when you started beating him at that point. soderling beat him with the flat ball. do you think we'll have more flat shots on the tour?
anything wrong with your racquets?
is that atypical for you?
what were your thoughts going into the third set tiebreaker?
the fourth set?
did you watch taylor dent last night?
talking about cheering for some of the other americans. you have to feel pretty good seeing him?
did you see he grabbed the microphone from the chair umpire?
how do you explain how you beat andy roddick at what he does best: serving, forehand, tiebreaks?
how do you think you were fortunate?
can you go back to the first match point that you had in the fourth set. he hit an ace and all of a sudden wins 13 straight points. was that game still in your head when you were serving at 5-all?
is it different to beat a mentor than it is to beat another highly ranked player who you don't have that relationship with?
couple nights ago when i asked andy to set up this match, i asked what had changed about your game, he said you were playing more like you did when you first turned pro. do you agree with that? if so, why?
is the improvement mainly in conditioning as well as just match experience?
does he emphasize more off-court work?
you said in your first press conference that your fitness was still getting back to full level. did you feel an urgency had you to close the match out early?
were you as calm on the inside as you appeared on the outside throughout that match?
did you expect to win?
can you articulate what this win means to you?
andy only got 48% coming into the net tonight. it's a big momentum shift at 2-3 in the breaker when andy made the approach shot and you passed him. the whole thing of him trying to make a net appearance, you shutting him down, do you feel that was something you talked about beforehand, or did you feel for it and go for it at that point?
so it was in your mind, you made the decision you were gonna serve and volley before you hit it, or did you feel good after you hit it?
seeing karlovic out there, how much either talking to him or watching how he's played has sort of affected how you've evolved the last few years?
watching the way he plays?
you're wearing a georgia bulldog cap tonight. what has that program meant to you?
compared to 5,000 or 6,000 barking fans in athens to the new yorkers tonight...
can you talk about fernando verdasco.
when andy was asked how he likes your chances against verdasco, he said it depends how he can pull up physically. do you think you have the quickness and the physical? will your legs hold up to face verdasco?
will you practice against a lefty tomorrow?
can you talk about the d.c. loss you suffered to andy earlier this year, what you were able to take away from it.
are you surprised with how quickly your success has come?
with your georgia roots, have you talked at all with melanie during your career? your thoughts on her performance?
what were some of your conversations?
when you saw her result, did that pump you up?
maybe that was for the best.
how much did the mono compel you to reevaluate?
moving forward, do you change your routine versus who your new opponent will be, or do you stick to the same routine?
on court.
did andy's conditioning, all that loss of weight in any way inspire your own dedication to your career?
what is your official game style? who are you out there on the court as a game style right now?
offensive all quarter now?
what is it that makes him just so terribly difficult to play?
you obviously have a long history with roger, including three matches here now. when you come into a match like this, how hard is it to let go of what's happened in the past and come in with a clean slate?
how are you playing?
but you're better than you have been. you're better than you have been in a long time.
it does?
how much can you tweak match to match against a guy like him in terms of strategy and tactics?
what about the forehand? do you try to play it a bit?
you've played a lot of the greats over your career. he's got the record for maybe right now. but where do you put him up in terms of competition with the players you've played?
mcenroe couldn't believe how well you moved after your hip surgery, given what happened to magnus norman and gustavo kuerten. was your surgery similar to theirs?
mcenroe also felt you were well on the way the you played today back into the top 10. can you drop back into the top 10? is that your aim?
do you think your game is anywhere near its peak? i mean, obviously you were no.1 in the world for two years straight six years ago, but is your game anywhere near that level?
i know it's no fun when you're out of the tournament to think about these things, but how do you see the event now sort of shaping up?
what do you think about del potro?
murray.
watching safin heading to retirement, seems like he lost a little bit of fire for the game. after all these years for you, do you still feel like you have as much desire for the game as you had back in 2001 and years ago?
do you feel as though you might have a point to prove to anybody out there?
i imagine you think that roger is still beatable down the track if you play him again.
what was the nature of the surgery?
does it seem to be a long time till the australian open right now, or does it seem like time to really get your game going before the new year starts?
what does the fall look like in terms of getting your ranking up?
what is your schedule?
that's a little bit probably harder of a match than you would have liked, but to get through a match like that, do you actually learn perhaps more that is valuable in terms of getting into championship form than an easy win?
he has some unorthodox strokes?
have you ever had a serve where your racquet landed on the other side of the court?
what happens there, novak?
it went out, right?
seemed like it kind of got you focused or something.
playing against an american player here when all the crowd supports him so strongly, does it get into your brain? does it pump you up?
how much of a relief was it that in the end they all cheered for you again like last year?
you weren't really sure if they were really cheering for...
two years ago you, ana, and jelena were all vying for championships. you're sort of carrying the serbian flag alone now. does that put more pressures on your shoulders?
do you think there's a lot of pressure because of all that support that maybe ana and jelena have had a difficult time absorbing and dealing with?
most men's players, when you go to serve you take three balls, reject one of them. how big a deal is it with the balls, and is part of it just a ritual or a superstition or a time killer?
do you think it makes a difference?
does witten look like a tennis player to you, physically?
how do you feel you played today? was it a pretty quick match.
how do you feel you're playing so far this tournament? what do you have to do for the second week to raise your game?
you mentioned that you've lost some weight recently.
can you talk about that? is that something you are trying to do to get lighter to improve the movement, or it just happened?
but it was conscious?
pleased to get through that, considering you weren't feeling your best?
was it the heat, as well? did that get to you?
had you prepared any differently in terms of what you ate or drank before?
is this perhaps the most fun open for you? because here in the states where you're not recognized as much, do you find you can enjoy new york city when you're not here?
do you get recognized here?
do you think you get enough respect for your success and how you play? everybody talks about roger's game, rafa's game, andy roddick's game. is that even an issue with you?
considering the success you've had on hardcourts coming into the tournament, have you ever entered a grand slam feeling as good about your game? talk about your state of mind, because you've had a tremendous summer season.
is it true that perhaps here you can kind of let it all hang out in that you don't have to preserve your body for a long season ahead because it is the conclusion of the season?
from a corporate endorsement point of view, is this the most important of grand slams for endorsement money?
kentucky is not known for its tennis program exactly. how did you end up going there in the first place?
are kentucky tennis fans, do they travel as well as big blue basketball plans?
seems like more than five fans were there today. what do you have to say about the fan block that you had?
are there benefits to playing through qualifying, especially early in a tournament? do you feel like you see the ball better? you have a better feel for the court?
can you talk about the opposite end of this? what is sort of the little, smallest, dinkiest lowest moment in tennis?
yeah, for you. i'm saying your experience. this is the height. talk about the other end, the journeyman who has to go through the stuff every week, all the qualifiers.
like what? give us some examples?
so i was going to say what keeps you going at those moments?
what kind of hotels do you get in mansfield?
have you in a serious way confronted the question of whether you need to stop tennis at some point and start another career?
this year?
and if you had made a different decision, what would that have fork have looked like?
did you get your major?
end of the third set, you were a lot more vocal, seemed more frustrated than you had in any of your qualifying matches. were you feeling the pressure of realizing maybe you were going to get through to the next round? were you feeling tired? you guys had traded a few breaks. what was going on with you at that point in the match?
have you looked ahead at your next match?
how long have you been in new york? when did you arrive?
are you staying in a hotel?
in tennis, the common names used to be pancho, and now maybe andre. not too many jesses, but this summer has been a great summer for jesse levine taking out safin. have you ever talked to him? what's your head to head?
talk about your money situation. as you said, it's really tough, really expensive.
yeah. but what's the dough going to mean to you?
perhaps coach calipari could help. maybe he could sponsor you.
who was the sponsor that dropped you?
but it was important income.
tell us about your family, what your parents do? were you born in naples?
where in california?
the pressure that you feel when you're playing on a big stage like you did today, how does that compare to the pressure of being in brownsville, texas, and wondering if you should be doing what you're doing?
what's your brother's name and sister's name?
are you a miami dolphins fan?
serena and venus are partners now.
who is the best player in kentucky tennis history?
that wasn't so easy.
was he disrupting your game or were you having trouble?
what got you through?
how much of the success you've been having during the summer accounts for having that belief and push and drive to do that and come through?
there's some talk about an american bounce-back in terms of our place in tennis. do you have any feel for that? do you think there's something to that?
is there any sense at all maybe a little bit of momentum is going here?
is being able to will yourself to get through a match and win it part of the process of getting to the next level?
could you describe what the successes you've had over the summer, how they help you right now, how you feel right now compared to ever having going into a grand slam tournament? are you more confident now?
do you feel your expectations of yourself are higher now?
if you end up winning the $2.6 million, will you buy pizza for the press corporation?
this has been an extraordinary summer for the men in terms of matchups. the top eight in a quarterfinal, the top four in a semifinal. how do you explain that, where you see that with the men and maybe not so much with the women? what do you think that does for the tour? does everyone benefit from those kind of matchups?
does it push you?
you came into the game with power. i know you worked on your fitness. is speed kind of the last component you can work on to make it into the top 10?
one of the things that's kind of marked your public personality is how much you enjoy being where you are, doing what you're doing. as you're climbing through the rankings, are you still able to enjoy it, or is more work?
quick geographical question. you were being introduced as being from thousand oaks. i thought you were from santa monica. what's the truth?
you might be the pride of santa monica as you get higher and higher?
how close are you to the ocean?
how much longer is dan with you?
what percentage of your prize money are you paying?
james is a likable guy. now that you're the second-ranked american, how hungry are you to get into the davis cup lineup?
can you talk a little bit about the dan situation. i know it was his idea, but you're a guy that seems to think outside of the box, set yourself up as a stock with investors. talk about that.
any downsides?
after this tennis thing winds down, are you going to go into shoe design?
when you're playing somebody who doesn't have as much firepower like you, do you feel like the match is in your hands more so than usual?
i know you're coming back from having mono. are you feeling 100%?
you said in the last press conference your immediate goal is to get into the top 50. that's going to happen after this tournament. now that that is the case, what is your next immediate goal?
so far this seems to be a great tournament for american tennis. american men's tennis is making a comeback or improving?
the match hasn't played yet, but in all likelihood you'll play andy roddick in the third round. you played him in d.c. this summer. what did you learn from that match that you can apply?
i know you're playing doubles with sam querrey. how is that working out? make a good team?
the other day after your first-round match, you were saying there were some things in your game - good things in your game and bad things in your game - that you needed to address. do you feel today you've sort of addressed those things that were troubling you the other day?
i know it's difficult to look ahead. do you see yourself right now in a position where you can go deep into the second week of this tournament?
you said in toronto last year that you continue to play despite the shoulder injuries because you love being on big courts entertaining the fans. this year, how do you sum up big courts in all the tournaments, playing roger and rafa?
compared to when you were no.2 in the world years ago, how happy are you on court now this year?
at wimbledon, the match against llodra, after it ended you hung around the court and you played with ball kids for around ten minutes and had a good time on the court. would you have done something like that four or five years ago?
can you give some thoughts about this match against kendrick in particular? what was ultimately the key for to you win in straight sets?
he seemed a little annoyed, i don't know, with the time that it took for you to challenge or not. do you think that that was an issue at all? do you think he had a right to be a little annoyed?
what's the reason for your resurgence this summer? is it just health?
what's your goal? another major? is it certain rounds? certain ranking?
boris becker obviously cast a long shadow on tennis. how would you describe the state of tennis in your country?
assess the match.
do you worry about not getting tested? are you just as happy to have relatively smooth sailing?
when you were growing up, there wasn't much international tennis coming out of serbia. you won a grand slam, many other things. what do you think novak as a small boy would think of the man, the international athlete today?
my question was more about you and what your thoughts as a young boy would be. what would you think of all you've achieved now and the place you have, what would the little boy think of the grown novak?
exactly.
what would you have thought?
you're known for the imitations, your michael jackson in monte-carlo. how did it go with the bryan brothers?
two years ago you were very spontaneous about it. it was a coming out for you. last year it seemed as if you made a calculated effort not to do that. do you look back and think maybe i was overly thinking about that last year and you didn't really allow your personality to come out?
sometimes the mark of maturity is understanding who you are and accepting that. if that means some people by nature are a little goofy or funny, that's okay.
you've had some nice results this summer. do you feel right now you're at a point mentally, physically...
novak made a comment that sometimes it is better to be tested early on in a tournament, especially a tournament that lasts a fortnight. do you feel the same way?
you mentioned the tiebreaker. the way you played for that three or four points, that must give you a lot of confidence.
were you surprised at rochus' ability to hang in there?
it's certainly been a good day for american men's tennis here. jesse witten was talking about hoping this would carry over beyond two weeks here, as it has all summer, get back to the level it was a few years ago. what are your thoughts about that?
the tennis fans come out to cheer for great tennis, but you've always been a fan favorite here, from the area. talk about what the experience is like.
this tournament pretty much caps the year. is it something that you think about all year long?
do you view this open is more important for you to salvage an injury-plagued year for you?
you spoke about the injuries. what about the actual tennis difficulties that you've had this year? what do you put that down to? loss of confidence?
no residual pain? how did you do it?
was the j block a little bit more feisty this time around?
do you feel 100% physically fit? if so, is there a feeling that you can let it all hang out?
there's a rumor floating around you might be going over to citi field to take batting practice in the next week.
thank you for all the good times. many, many years from now, if your grandkids, if they came up to you and said, hey, summarize the incredible career you had as an athlete, what would be the one word, the one phrase in english that you would use?
no.
you said i believe in london that you were sort of many years behind the times. if you could start again, would you play the tour with this classic conventional shots, or has it just been too much fun and too enjoyable...
if you were playing in the '70s, what kind of a ranking do you think you would have gotten back then against some of the other players? would have been fun going up against the harold solomons of the world?
let's say it's around 1989 or so, you're just about to come out in your career. what would the boy fabrice santoro think of the career and the man that you are now with traveling the whole world, all your doubles titles, so much love for you, so many experiences? what would that little boy or that young man think?
and do you ever wake up in a hotel and just have no clue where you are? how do you deal with that?
where was it going?
do you know where it was going?
many people are very critical of today's game, saying it has so much power it's not interesting, it's not intriguing. where is the touch? where is the finesse? where is the crafting of the points? what are your thoughts on that whole critique of the lack of poetry in the game?
you finished the same day as safin.
i know you've been looking forward to this for quite some time, and once you get to where you're not away all the time, how hard do you think it's going to be to adjust and to, quote unquote, normal kind of existence?
that's my point.
you hit a lot of winners, very few errors, and moved very well. is this your best feeling since coming back from the injury?
what changes happen to your attitude when you've been hurt and you've been out of play for a while? do you have to psych yourself up to get back to a winner mentality?
is it in the back of your mind about the knees, or now you don't think about it at all when you're playing?
you never had trouble on your serve today. was that a product of you serving well, or do you think he struggled on the return?
did you lose weight because you haven't trained for two months?
i have this impression you're coming back the same way you did when you missed the davis cup and china last year and you came back to win the australian open.
do you feel at this point in your career you need a lot of matches to play well, or are you experienced enough now to have fewer matches and then find the confidence, your top level?
it's been suggested you never have done well in this tournament or won because you were tired at the end of the year. do you think that's valid? if it is, the fact you missed some time, could that help you this time?
the injury you had to your knees, do you think it's specific to you or your style of play, or is it something that you can see with other players because of surface or the schedule or some other factor?
next round you're playing against nicolas kiefer.
a few weeks ago you were saying it was impossible to think about winning the open here. can you now think about winning?
you have such an adoring fan base, young, old, a lot of people wearing your t-shirts. did you miss them when you were away? how would you describe these fans who are always so excited to see you?
how many days did it take you when you were in mallorca to actually start enjoying it after the wimbledon pullout? were there days when you were thinking that you really wanted to defend the title?
any reason why you cut your hair shorter?
just wondering if there's a reason why.
another battle brewing with your old foe.
what about your net advances, 88%. seemed to get there a lot.
roger is probably a bit more capable of swatting those past you. can we expect to see that against him?
what about your new coaching arrangement? what has he brought to the equation?
what about your mindset playing roger? been a long time since you were able to beat him.
fatherhood distract him at all?
you're so familiar with each other. when you prepare to play him, is it actually easier or harder, because you're not scouting him? i assume you don't scout him. i assume you know his tendencies. what is it like when you have an opponent as familiar as roger?
is it more of a mental preparation for you than a tactical one?
your competitiveness is well-known. when you're preparing for roger, the quality that he brings, are you different the day before? are you exactly the same? are you sleeping as well?
have you spoken to roger about becoming a dad?
how did it affect your sort of tennis at all, just your life in general, when you obviously had your first child?
do you think he's free rolling now? won a slam. now he's got kids.
the french as well.
is it possible now that he's even more stress free, could he be more dangerous?
having watched him over the summer, tough spring for roger, his confidence dipped. when you watch him play or are preparing for him, can you see certain strokes that have come back that he didn't rely on as well?
is this the best sort of surface to meet roger on?
you played one tournament after your layoff. is it going to take time to get back? how much practicing did you do when you were not allowed to play? is it tough getting tournament-ready again?
why did you stop practicing?
does it feel almost like a wasted year? is it hard to get over that, to get your mind back into playing again?
how do you see the shape of rafael? is he 100%? 70%?
like nadal of old?
what was the reception in the locker room after what happened the last few months?
this is the first time some of us have had a chance to talk with you. when the ruling first came out, what were your feelings? were you angry?
when you got the suspension.
are all the aspects of the situation finished now? there are no more legal ramifications?
you have a very nice one-handed backhand. is it an advantage to have a one-handed backhand or two now?
how would you describe your own one-handed backhand?
why did you have so many struggles today returning nadal's serve?
how does it feel to be the opening act tonight?
normally you and stan are the only swiss players at the grand slams. this year marco chiudinelli qualified. can you talk about your relationship with him?
obviously marat finished his last grand slam today. have you been able to talk to him today? what are your thoughts on that?
did you get a chance to watch rafa at all today? what's it like having him back in the draw of a major?
whether it's here or somewhere else, do you expect to play him again hopefully in a final?
you're defending champion, world no.1, coming in here hot. andre picks murray as his choice to win this title. does that intrigue you? interest you? irritate you?
you have said in a grand slam you should be prepared to play 35 sets. how do you feel?
do you feel like that?
if you've beaten somebody 13 times in a row, is there anything that lleyton could do that would surprise you at this stage of your contest?
we spoke to simon about tonight's match. you broke him early. he said it was going to be a long night. he said you didn't play as well in the second set, gave him some confidence. could you feel him gaining confidence?
in beijing you played singles and doubles. can you envision ever doing that in a grand slam?
is it just because of the wear and tear, the scheduling? is that at the root of it?
he said that?
is your back in any way a factor? do you have to prepare in any way because of it?
has there ever been an opponent where you've had a run of losing to or where maybe doubts start to creep into your mind?
extremely rare these days for two fathers to play in a grand slam match in singles. you've had quite a long rivalry with lleyton. it's been quite special, hasn't it?
have you sought any advice about fatherhood from lleyton?
was there any match in particular with lleyton that really was special for you?
biggest win of your career?
what happened?
that guy is seeded. he's a good player.
we talked to devin britton yesterday; similar response. first time out. he was sort of amazed. he was in awe of roger federer, et cetera.
what was your mindset taking the court?
were you surprised?
we saw john isner yesterday. is this an argument to go to college?
how is that kinesiology?
are you at all surprised? he mentioned john isner. there were many college athletes here yesterday. a lot of them won yesterday. does that surprise you at all?
in this tournament, there's all these college people -- do you guys talk about this at all?
it's like 30 gs getting to the second round. what are you going to do with it?
were there some folks from kentucky up there?
are they sticking around now?
you can get them another hotel room?
do you have any ideas what to do with it? that's a chunk of change.
how close did you come...
what do you do if you don't play tennis?
seriously, do you have a backup plan?
a lot of guys go to college and stop after a year or two years. you stayed four; got your degree. was there ever a point in your time there where you thought about leaving?
when you say that, you're talking about like an agency?
any concern keeping the nerves in check? you have a day or two to think about this heading into the next round.
is there anybody you sought out advice from about andreev in particular, playing him, what would work against him, what to watch out for?
are you sort of looking at this tournament sort of as an opportunity for you to take perhaps the next step in your career? you've established yourself obviously as one of the top 10 players, and perhaps this is going to be an opportunity to get even further than that.
how did you feel about the way you played today? just seemed like everything was working for you.
how important is it to get out there and get off to a start like you did today?
going forward, you're either going to play fognini or nieminen. do you have a history against those guys? if so, how do you match up?
nieminen won.
you said you're here to win. do you have a real belief that that's a legitimate thing that you can accomplish at this us open?
could you talk about your work with todd martin, how you came to contact him, what you're getting out of that relationship?
what was the link? todd has been around for a long time. who did you know that knew todd?
i think you're an excellent match. but who...
is it to the end of the year, the end of the tournament?
this match for you today was a walk in the park.
how are you going to stay mentally strong?
how do you stay mentally strong?
bearing in mind your early years, do you probably know his game as well or better than anyone else?
are you curious how the fans would welcome you this year after what happened last year?
you're such a fun-loving guy. you have a lot of personality. you became a fan favorite because of that. did that have any effect on how you act or hold yourself anymore?
how you carry yourself.
did you have a todd impression?
this may be marat safin's last grand slam. what will you remember about his career and what will we miss when he's not playing anymore?
you are very loose. did you take any of his example when you started coming on and becoming a top player?
his sister was in here and she said he's given her advice, but sometimes it's hard to understand what he says.
has he ever given you a great piece of advice or anything on how to handle the stress?
what was it regarding?
this would be the most interesting part of the interview.
after the long wait, how great did that feel?
there must have been times where you didn't think you'd get back to this point, right?
how long did you spend in bed?
had you not had these surgeries, what would the quality of your life be?
what were the names of some of the back specialists you saw?
a young athlete like you, how do you stand it?
would you reflect?
what was the game?
what were the religions you dabbled in?
do you have a sense of how many games in a row you can play without discomfort or how much rest you need?
if you get tomorrow off, you think you'll be fine for thursday playing again?
was the september surgery different from the march surgery?
you're not federer on the final sunday lifting the trophy, but it's still pretty wonderful.
how does it feel to be a us open winner?
talk about the match. he's a tough opponent with a massive serve.
during this period of illness was there a player who gave you a lot of support?
you really were a big part of american men's tennis. could you reflect on the changes and the state of the game since you started playing and watching the game, now back again?
why do you think you didn't just give up? why was it important for you to continue tennis?
back to when you hurt your back, was it a specific moment or was it cumulative, degenerating over time?
but five years ago when you were actively playing, it was sort of a chronic thing you had?
were these cortisone injections?
but that family?
you said you weren't that much of a religious guy. now that that shooting pain is gone, you have mobility, give us your best spiritual shot here. what is it like to be healthy?
so the best gift under your christmas tree are the wins?
do you have any active sponsors?
did they stick with you during the back pain?
great day for southern california tennis.
do you ever hang together, practice together, or pretty much each to his own?
after the match ended here tonight, you spent a lot of time with the fans. do you mind sharing any of the things that were said to you in that time?
how did you get back to fitness, full fitness, so quickly after having mononucleosis?
when you talk about having a scare, was it just that you felt exhausted, or what, for you, are the symptoms?
and you were playing doubles.
why play doubles when you're already trying to conserve your energy?
you were diagnosed in may, but when do you think it really began?
how serious do you think it was knowing what happened to mario ancic and what federer went through?
i seemed midway through your second set you sort of mistimed your forehand a little bit more. was that a reaction to the way hanescu was scrambling, or was it more of a technical issue?
how do you feel going into the next match with a day's rest?
talk about the tiebreak a little bit, fighting off ten set points in the second set.
it seems like a lot of your big results this summer have come as you now move into your third full year on tour as a professional. is that just becoming more accustomed to life on tour or something you've been working on specifically?
considering what you just said, do you feel there is more and more pressure on young u.s. tennis players right now?
i say that because, before the u.s. used to be the eminent country on the tour. it's not the case anymore. how do you deal with that?
but you don't feel people here are expecting too much from you?
to answer who cares, i imagine the usta must care. if you don't have americans doing well, that would affect economics, prize money, television rights, things like that.
are you beginning to feel that your season is beginning to mirror your favorite baseball team?
you haven't talked to the mets players, compared notes.
how many tournaments have you missed?
did you watch the ceremony with andre? if you didn't even, just what he's done with his foundation, what do you think other athletes can learn from him?
agassi was saying in this country there's not a lot of young kids playing tennis. needs to be a grassroots movement to get more youngsters playing tennis. what do you think needs to be done to accomplish that?
do you think the tennis pros like yourself, like andre, you have to take the lead and try to get the grasroots movement going?
can someone go to college, graduate from college, then be a star?
when your career is over, are you going to go back to massachusetts and finish up there?
does your mom stay on you for that?
you beat a guy today that beat you last time out. what was the difference today?
were you surprised when the chair umpire erased the word "fila" on your headband?
what do you think of the rule? signs all over everything else.
you know what it's like to get a second wind in your career. what is it going to take for you to get a third wind?
do you definitely feel better about missing the pilot pen? do you feel more refreshed?
the third wind again. younger players emerging ready to win majors. i know you were talking about small injuries, but do you feel like you have to start over, or is it a matter of healing and going back to your spot?
how does 29 feel different than 22 physically? what do you feel more than you did?
with the debate of the greatest of all-time, obviously with you winning the 15th slam and all that, laver said you can't compare eras. if you had to answer the question in terms of criteria to determine who the greatest of all-time would be, how would you go about answering that? not adjust a player, but what to you constitutes the greatest of all-time in the sport of tennis?
it would be natural to lose focus a little bit after a milestone win at wimbledon, after becoming a father for the first time. you clearly haven't if this week was an indication. how do you think you've been able to manage that?
you mentioned in the awards ceremony with mary joe how happy you are in your personal life. you said it's perfect. is there a direct correlation between that and how well you play?
how special is this title for you? it's your 61st of your career and your first as a new dad.
is this title any different than the previous ones since you became a father?
do you ever let your opponents relax?
is there a point in the match where a point is not as difficult for them as it is at any other time? do you always stay after it every point?
one of the other things you said on court was that you are quite lucky to be here because the girls came earlier than expected. when were they supposed to come?
could have been difficult.
going into next week's us open, how would you assess your current confidence level as opposed to going into the us open this time last year?
how would you compare this tournament to the other stops on the tour? what do you appreciate about cincinnati the most?
tiger will be in the new york area next week for a tournament. have you texted or talked about getting together at some point?
do you have a friendly rivalry with him just in terms of like you're one major ahead of him now. do you guys give each other grief?
seems like your serve is back to its very best. is that something you're most happy with?
3-3 in the second set, you had a fantastic dropshot that kind of got the crowd going. was that a big momentum changer? the first set you kind of had a relatively easier time compared to the second set. talk about your performance in the second set. and also, did you feel that djokovic maybe increased his level in the second set to make it tighter?
can you speak to the importance of winning that second game of the first set today?
how big of a factor in this match was the very first service game you had where you got broken after a really long struggle?
on the last game of the match you turned around. it looked like someone must have said something to you. and even before that game you were talking...
like negative...
did you do anything differently in the second set? seemed like you started serving better and the volleys seemed more crisp.
do you also have a little bit of frustration just that you've got to so many masters 1000 finals this year and haven't been able to convert those into titles?
do you feel like you found something in your game again this week?
i wanted to get your perspective on the greatest of all-time debate. some people say roger is with all he's accomplished. even rod laver said you can't compare players from different eras. if you had to establish some criteria to what would the greatest of all-time player, without naming names...
as has been pointed out earlier, you've graced many masters series finals this year. what do you need to do to replicate that in the grand slam event? this year you've probably been a little disappointed with how you've done.
what do you hope todd will bring to your game when you start working with him? will that be next week?
can you share any of the ideas he has?
when you've been playing your best over the last couple years, your second serve has been very aggressive.
in the last few months, do you feel like that's one of the things you need to get back?
as you showed in the post-match ceremony, you have a great personality. what do you need to do in new york to win back the fans that you won over two years ago and maybe lost last year?
after the first set or after you got broken twice in the first set, when you won the first service game you kind of smiled and waved at the crowd. did it help you relax and get back into the match? seemed like from that point you played a lot better.
what happened in the first set when you got broken twice in terms of was there something about his game that threw you off?
despite the result tonight, you played great tennis after being two months out. what we can expect for the us open?
you've talked this week like you didn't expect to win the tournament. do you feel like you're ready to win tournaments again?
does any ranking change affect maybe your mentally, the drop from 1st, 2nd, and now 3rd?
what was the strategy, your plan of attack going into the match? djokovic actually had is 4-3 edge against you in hardcourt matches, even though you led overall. what were you trying to capitalize on in the match?
do you feel you did that?
we miss your uncle toni. where is he now?
is he gonna be at the us open?
djokovic had you running around a lot and staying in a lot of long rallies. in terms of the long rallies you were playing and hard hitting rallies, how do you feel physically after that?
focus?
that challenge in the tiebreak, did you know right away it was -- were you second guessing yourself? you kind of fell on the ground when you said challenge.
do you take anything from the fact that you fought back? you fought back from a hole in the second set, to fought back from a hole in the tiebreak. does that mean anything?
was roger's level of play similar to the us open final from last year?
why do you think you couldn't play your best today?
how do you feel then just ahead of the us open? do you feel in really good shape for the open and pretty high on confidence after the efforts over the last couple of weeks?
yesterday you were mentioning your series with andy was just a couple points here and there. the question is: what did you do differently today, if you can think of anything? because the difference was only a couple points here and there that enabled you to pull through.
given that pattern of matches that you mentioned, were you quite relieved to close it out in straight sets?
talk about the pressure in the tiebreaker that can lead to double faulting a match away? have you ever done that? and how do you keep your cool in those points?
when was the last time you felt that good on this surface this year?
you're playing very well today, but do you think that the timing of the win is as important as the win itself obviously going into new york?
do you consider yourself a natural-born entertainer, or is that a role as an athlete you had to grow into over the years as you've been in the biggest stages?
the fans are hoping rafa wins tomorrow. do you have a preference?
how would you describe the difference between the last tournament in montreal and here in cincinnati?
do you feel better now?
if it's rafa tomorrow, did you expect to face him so soon after his comeback, or does it seem like a long time since you played him?
even though recent matches with andy have been close ones, psychology starts to enter into it if it gets too lopsided. how important was it to win today rather than going into new york perhaps with an 0-5 streak if you meet again?
who presents more of a challenge for you tomorrow? both players are very difficult. in terms of your game, who would be more difficult to play?
who would people confuse you with when you said you were just coming up?
could you explain a little bit your feelings after a great performance like today.
do you think you're at somewhat of a disadvantage with the quite late start and obviously a very early final? roger has obviously had a lot longer rest.
despite your record -- you're 4 and 14 in the series and your four wins came on hardcourts -- do you go into this match with a lot of confidence? talk a little bit about that.
when you think about your meeting with roger at last year's us open in the semis, or when you even think about that us open, do you think of that match, or did it get kind of lost in what happened in the quarters against andy and all the ruckus that followed?
so what specifically do you need to focus on to beat roger tomorrow?
i heard that there was a possibility for you and rafa to play doubles here in cincinnati; is that true?
you didn't win, but you played quite well and you had a great tournament. how are you feeling going into the us open? are you ready to do some damage?
there was a couple points near the end of the match where there was a couple dropshots that you didn't go after, and a couple wide shots that you kind of just let them go by. were you feeling okay out there?
was it because of the weather, or are you just getting exhausted from the tour?
what is the injury?
you've been in the top 10 for a little bit now, most of the year. how has it been in the last year to be in the top 10, to reach that goal?
is life as a player different when you're in the top 10? have you noticed any differences being on the tour this year?
we missed you in indianapolis last month. is there a reason you didn't go back? once you saw how the draw ended up and andy not being there, do you wish you would have been there?
are you playing next week or just resting up for the open?
is the knee getting better?
how much did that long rally change the psychology of the match?
how important was it to win this match today? did it matter a great deal or...
julien didn't make it through qualifying. he got the lucky loser slot and then made it to the qualifies. when he has momentum like that, that does it factor into your preparation for the match?
can you remember another competitive match where you had more than a 53-shot rally?
what goes through your mind during a point like that? are you telling yourself to hang in there?
if he had won the point, how different do you think things might have been?
i know you're asked this all the time, but if you do play federer, what do you look forward to when you go on court against roger?
you mentioned the tough conditions out there.
apparently the record for the longest rally is 643 shots. knowing how you felt after a 53-shot rally, could you even imagine that?
it was a wta match in 1984.
when you're in a 53-shot rally like that and you can hear the crowd a couple times thought the point was over, does that factor into how you're playing?
you've already qualified for the masters. that must be pretty pleasing to get there so early.
it seemed like you were serving very well today. you won 89% of your first serve points and didn't face a breakpoint throughout. can you elaborate on that?
you've won 13 matches in a row against him now. obviously probably not lucky each time. what do you attribute your success to? that's a pretty good run.
do you feel that's your best performance so far since wimbledon?
is there anything about murray's game that makes it more difficult for you to play him than other people? he's one of the few players or tour that i think has an edge in head-to-head meetings with you.
it's been such an eventful summer for you. has it sunk in yet what you've accomplished in terms of two large career goals that you had in front of you three months ago are not there anymore?
how strange or not does it feel to you that you're going into a no.1 versus no.2 matchup tomorrow and the other guy isn't rafa?
has there been any change to you in terms of the number of years you're gonna play left to play in the game? you have the career grand slam, the number of slam wins, you've got the record there. what's left for to you accomplish in the game?
does evening up your career record against guys like murray and nadal enter into your mind or motivate you at all as you look towards your legacy?
is there psychological stress that comes with a tournament like this with five straight days where you don't get a chance to catch your breath, or is it markedly different from a grand slam experience?
do you prefer a day or night match for the semifinals and? and looking ahead, if you were to win, for the what's better for you in terms of rest and all that stuff?
so it wouldn't bother you to play a night semifinal tomorrow, and then if you won that, go to the final in the afternoon the next day?
we see you very relaxed now. is it because you're where you wanted, and now the pressure is on the other players to complete their goals and dreams?
and do you enjoy playing andy, or is there a different dynamic, a different edge to how you approach the matches with andy now?
your thoughts on the match today, on your performance.
how much satisfaction do you take from your performances so far this week?
are you benefitting a bit, do you think, from flying under the radar a bit? people are talking about murray coming to no.2 and of course federer's 15th. can you come into the open with a little less pressure?
do you think your runner-up finish last year here and how well you've done so far in this tournament gives you any kind of edge as you head into tomorrow's semifinal?
if you face rafa tomorrow, do you expect to face the rafa of old, or do you think he's gonna be slightly rusty still?
you've always been an intense player. also seemed like as you were working your way up to no.3 you were having a lot fun on the court and you really enjoyed the battle and the competition. are you still having fun playing?
well, i haven't been on court. today i saw some negative body language. maybe it's always been there. you hit a great winner and kind of yelled at yourself.
you've got your own tournament in belgrade. have you had any success in trying to recruit the other top players to play in it next year?
can you describe how the dynamics of the match changed after that 53-shot rally?
did you think about that point again as the match went on?
you had already been on the court for a very long time this week, too. did that play a factor?
yeah. eight hours already.
you seemed very aggressive in the first set, and even at the beginning of the second. you had some really good dropshots of your own beginning of the second set. were you pretty comfortable out there? were you nervous at all or just relaxed?
you started out as a lucky loser and made it all the way to the quarterfinals. how is your confidence right now?
what did you learn most about today's match?
you were very close to your first semifinal in a master or 1000. does this make you more hungry to take the next step and get to a semifinal or final or win one of these big ones?
it felt like you had bad calls go against you. how did you avoid getting too frustrated?
in the second set, you played so much better than you did in either of the two sets yesterday or the first set today. what was different? what clicked for you?
what do you think the fans here in cincinnati? when you're on the court, what do you like about the people here?
it seemed in the second set also your tactics were much more aggressive. you were more attacking the ball. is this right? and was it because of having more confidence in your game?
what was the strategy going into the match in terms of were you trying to attack a specific shot of his, forehand, backhand, or...
yeah, today.
did you feel your timing was better today? if so, it was a matter of positioning?
how do you feel going into the quarters and looking on to the us open?
what do you think about berdych next? you've had some good matches with him in the past.
what's the difference between having francisco and uncle toni in the stands?
in the second set especially it seemed you got to several balls that seemed like they were winners. you know, you ran them down and returned them for winners also. did you sense that demoralized him a little bit or made him try desperate things or affected him?
you seemed absolutely thrilled after the match with your level of play. how great does it feel to be back smacking around tennis balls after such a long layoff?
did you feel you were in control all the way through?
what do you have to tell yourself to do in these conditions?
you've played federer very well, and there seems to be some players that almost feel like there's a mental wall that they are not expected to beat the nadals and the federers, and they don't. how did you avoid that? what was your mindset that enabled you to have success?
how do you feel about your recording on the bryan brother's album?
when we told blake that you had driven here, he said, oh, i think he's a little bit afraid of flying. do you have any kind of fear of flying with all the flights you take in a year?
you look fresher than you did on monday or on tuesday rather.
your opponent lost in quallies and he came through a three-hour match today. are you pretty clear that you're gonna feel a lot fresher than him tomorrow?
how tough were the conditions out there today?
you must be pleased with your return. you seemed to return well in those conditions?
this tournament can be really hot and perhaps a lot more humid than what it was. have you found it not being so taxing, the conditions in terms of how you're feeling?
roger federer talked about playing you and how much he enjoys. he even said today that to play you would be the match he would've wanted to play because you've had such a long rivalry over the years. do you see it the same way?
if you can beat him, the confidence will be lifted not only for this week but also for the us open.
can you talk about your relationship with roger? kind of building on what you said, you grew up together. are you guys friends off the court?
looking at the head to heads, 2003 was obviously a pivotal match that you came back and won. since then, he's pretty much dominated that. what are you gonna need to do to play him to turn the tables on him?
how do you keep your mental edge and composure in tight matches? you were broken to go down 3-1 in the final set, but you came right back and broke him again. you didn't get flustered.
how difficult was it to make shots in the wind?
how did you use the wind to your advantage?
rafa said that you're an obvious favorite for the us open. do you agree with that?
were you disappointed with your first serve? first serve percent was 62%. i've seen you serve better.
you talked yesterday about the up-and-down performances here in the past. with that in mind, how frustrating would it have been if you hadn't got past him today.
what do you want to improve on for your next match here?
after the highs of french open and the record, did you go through any sort of emotional letdown at all?
what's a better matchup for you, hewitt or querrey?
when all the power came into the men's game with the racquets, it seemed like a lot of the art was taken out of the game.
well, now i think it's coming back and we see a lot of different styles. you don't think it went out of the game?
how do you analyze your performance today?
throwing the racquet is not a good example, but it seemed to have helped you.
it worked and you broke back.
in terms of just how you feel, are you fresh? i mean, it was nice to win in straight sets in those conditions and not have to go to a third.
what are your thoughts on the quarterfinal?
obviously great for you last week, but this week, tough first match. he's a big server, too, no?
is it difficult when you lose a first set like that, it goes 14 points to 12 in the tiebreak, and then you'd just be a little bit flat at the start of the second; is that what happened with you?
i mean, last week obviously you had an incredible comeback against federer. sometimes you can't always come back, can you?
do you feel happy with your preparation for the us open? have you had enough matches?
you did well in montreal. were the conditions here much different?
what did affect your game?
how is your physical?
no more injuries?
how hard was it to get back in that second set after losing the tiebreaker like that?
what is the grand slam you dream to win the most?
french open?
first game of the match you broke after seppi hit a lob and you had to sprint. is the knee okay?
i noticed you weren't wearing a brace like you normally do.
do you feel that you're getting better with each match at the moment? do you feel better on the court?
i would like you to talk about your serve today. it worked well and you saved nine breakpoints from ten in the match. you had eight aces. is that what you've been working on lately?
when you say the knees are good, are you saying they don't hurt at all?
did this match tell you things about your physical condition, the state of your game, that the last two days of practice did not?
the match was a very close one that turned on just a few points in both sets. did he just play extremely well, or is that just the proof of how competitive the game is becoming?
given the injury layoff, what goals do you have for the end of the year? do you have a year-end ranking goal that you want to hit?
when you say your goal is to get better, are you talking about the pain or your timing? in what way do you need to get better?
to be successful on hardcourt, do you need to play a more aggressive style of tennis? do the tactics need to be the most aggressive?
i'm curious about what you're saying. do you have to be entirely 100% confident in your movement and your strokes in order to play aggressive?
do you think you moved well today?
do you think there's a favorite for the us open right now, or a group of favorites? how many guys do you think have a chance of winning the open?
you or anyone. is there a specific favorite right now, would you say?
you had the long game early in the second set. after that, you kind of seemed to be able to take control. does winning a game like that really help you out a lot, give you a boost?
do you feel you just kicked off where you left off in montreal, playing at the same level?
it's been seven years since someone has won canada and cincinnati. what do you think you have to do to overcome here to pull that off?
what are the thoughts on the next opponent, stepanek?
is it tough to get used to the humidity here, too?
did the rain delay affect your play?
key point of the match at 4-all, second set. you had three breakpoints against him, and he came back and won that game. what did you do differently when it was 5-all and you had two breakpoints and you converted that one?
what do you like about your game, and what do look at and say, i really want to work on this?
how much does a match like this reinforce that on many days, the difference between being no.1 and 51 isn't all that much, a few points played here and there?
what do you do specifically to adjust to a faster court?
i don't know how much you pay attention to the other matches, but how unique is it to be part of a lineup where the 5 top players of the world are playing back-to-back-to-back-to-back-to back on the same court?
a big year for you. obviously you got the grand slam record at wimbledon. you had twins. two questions: how is fatherhood changed you? you mentioned you weren't losing any sleep yet. and secondly, what goals do you have for the rest of the year?
you've got very good vision on the court. they changed from green to blue a few years ago. as a player, do you find that has improved the game and being able to see, or would you prefer the green?
looking at the lineup today and in montreal, do you think there's a greater number of players ready to win majors now than in the past few years?
don't you see a sort of a new era moving in now?
you seem to have a asymmetry going with tiger. he fell short of getting his 15th major this year. since that happened, there's been some suggestion that it's been a bad year for him, even though he has five titles because he didn't win a major. is it a bad year if you don't win a major, even if you collect a lot of other titles?
this match lasted an hour and ten minutes. would you prefer having longer matches in terms of to enhance your preparation for this tournament and the us open, or a much shorter match? what's better for you personally?
can you talk about your win today? seemed like you were serving we well. you won 18 out of 18 first serve points in the first set, and only dropped one first serve point the whole match.
how do you feel your preparation is going for the us open?
a lot has been asked about todd martin joining your team. what's your take on that?
i'm working on a story about injury timeouts and the use of them. there are some people in the game who feel that it has strayed from the original intent. anyway, in short, i'm wondering your philosophy on this opportunity to call for a trainer? do you feel it's well-handled by most players now, or do you feel the rules need to be reconsidered and maybe made more strict? if so, how could you do that?
you played last year with a wilson racquet. this year, head. what are the advantages, and do you play the same tension and same strings?
you said this racquet is faster, but is it fast enough to beat andy murray?
is your knee a 100%? i noticed tape on it. is it fine?
how do you feel about davydenko or kunitsyn?
you've got a reputation as being one of the more mentally tough players on the tour. did that help at all at the end of the second set? you had a match point, and he pulled the set out. didn't seem to bother you. how were you able to move on?
how do you feel about the way you're playing in general? i think last summer you were one of the best players on the tour going into the us open. has it been more of a struggle this summer?
that was a guy that you hadn't had a lot of success against before. what was the difference today? i mean, obviously he's just coming back after his foot problems, but...
sometimes when you lose a second set tiebreaker like that it can be hard to get back any momentum. how worried about that were you going into the third set?
you mentioned it being one of your biggest victories. what were you thinking immediately when you saw his backhand go wide on match point?
relieved to get through that match? long one.
were you struggling a little bit with your fitness?
some big serving in the breaker. you hit that forehand drop volley. talk about that a little bit.
were you happy with the way you returned? served? footwork?
how do you feel about this season? you were playing a few challengers, couple in april and june, and now you're sort of at a career high. seems like it's been a little bit topsy-turvy, but going in the right direction.
was it mono?
what's been clicking for you?
is that something you've been working on with craig?
do you ever get nervous in third set tiebreakers, or have you played so many that...
you both had really high winners to unforced errors ratios. is it frustrating to play a guy like that because you can't get the momentum? it's like, shot, winner, shot, winner.
going into the match, what were you trying to attack most? going for his backhand, forward? what was the strategy going in?
any concerns about the next match with this obviously taking a lot out of you and playing an unfamiliar opponent?
you've beat tsonga and taken roddick to 7-5 in the third. haas is one of the best players on tour this summer. do you feel like going into a match against anyone you have a pretty good chance?
you and sam sort of came on tour at the same time.
sort of feel like you guys have been making steady progress and waiting for a big result in a major event. do you feel like that, that you guys are sort of primed to make a big splash?
it's like you're coming up and sort of feels like mardy and james have been slipping a little bit and you guys are on the way up.
what goals do you have for the rest of the year?
you mentioned tommy haas hit his spots in the box serving. are you serving more for placement now, or how is your philosophy of serving changed?
what else has craig brought to your game, would you say?
fitness and movement probably the areas you need to improve most?
i know you're a big sports fan. when you had mono, did you watch french open and wimbledon and stuff like that?
who are your favorite teams?
thoughts on your win this afternoon? you saved a couple match points in the second set tiebreak.
what were the pleasing aspects of that performance, say, compared to last week in montreal?
so this leg problem that you talked about after your match in montreal, that's gone? you're a 100%?
how do you define success at this stage of your career?
how are you happy with where it is right now, 42?
today i believe soderling had 50 unforced errors, and you had only had 11. can you talk about your focus today and how you were able to minimize those?
just your thoughts, you know, next opponent, benjamin becker.
speak of federer, you two have experienced a lot of same things: you been no.1, not been no.1, married, father. what do you think keeps him going?
so you think the taste of success is what keeps driving him?
andy roddick, you played him three times this year: twice on grass and once indoor. have you sensed that he's improved and doing things better on the court, making better decisions? what's your take on that?
how did you feel out there physically?
obviously this is a time of year when you've really shined, and frustrating with the injury. what positive do you take of the post wimbledon season?
is it something that you look forward to, the challenge of trying to fight your way back up, or is it something that seems frustrating?
in the forward for the book charging the net, you talked about being inspired by serena and venus. i know they have a lot of tennis left, but what do you think their legacy will be? will it be how they changed the game or how they transcended the game?
you talked a moment ago about your motivation. what is your enjoyment level right now playing tennis?
has there ever been a point when you have not enjoyed the competition, or is that when you'll know it's time to leave?
on sam and andy, you played sam a couple times and beat him. he seems to be making definite strides, and andy as well. he's sort of put himself back in the conversation of the top 5. can you give me some thoughts on those two guys.
you're a veteran, and you know what it takes to stay motivated. different things motivate people. what do you think keeps a guy like federer motivated and going?
a lot of guys, murray has now got a group of people traveling with him, and djokovic just added todd martin as a coach. i think todd worked in the past with robby, and now he's with novak.
did you just lose to the world's greatest tennis player ever?
can you talk about when you were sitting in the chair and the crowd was chanting your name, what did that mean to you?
how is it possible to hold your concentration? you served from behind on 10 occasions with the title at stake.
how would you describe what you did today?
does it hurt more though when you're that close and it's that long, 95 minutes the last set? how does this compare to the other ones?
what happened on the high backhand volley?
when do you expect you'll start feeling better and feeling sort of happy with how you performed and the occasion as opposed to the disappointment now?
even during the match, could you appreciate this as a sporting event, or are you too locked in at that point?
what do you take most satisfaction from in what you did accomplish, even in defeat today?
didn't look real easy to have to rally after losing that second set. was there a struggle inside of you to stay positive? were you able to blank it out right away?
roger is such a tough opponent. what qualities make him so outstanding?
in that sense, do you think sort of he's the only person who you wouldn't have beaten playing like that today?
how were you feeling physically in that final game?
this whole tournament, has it given you a new belief, a greater confidence that you can be a slam winner again?
when you took that fall, you stayed down long enough for it to cause concern around the stadium. did you hurt anything?
do you feel like that was the best match you've ever played?
a lot of people thought this was going to be about your big serve, roger's getting around the court, his ability to hit passing shots. clearly that wasn't really the theme there when you look at how well you played from the baseline and how well he served, did that surprise you at all?
is it crazy or is it a blessing in disguise that you're expected to play an indoor match on clay in four or five days?
liberate this man. well done, andy.
how hard was that compared to other finals you've played here?
what went through your head when you finally won the second set?
what are your feelings for andy now?
you said that as a boy you couldn't have dreamed of this. was there a point as a boy where the game captured you, inspired you, and you said, that's what i want to be?
was there a final or something?
a lot of players go through their entire career never winning one grand slam. what's it like to win 15?
your first grand slam title was wimbledon. now your 15th is wimbledon. both titles are memorable. do you feel destiny or anything?
he got here late actually.
when did you actually find out he was coming? it was a will he, won't he, will he, won't he for the last couple of days. were you given notice he was going to be there?
you've reclaimed the tennis throne, winning the french, here, no.1 spot, without facing rafael nadal. does that take anything out of it in any way?
what is going to be your next priorities?
from here.
do you feel like you're the happiest person right now?
up till this point of your career, do you still have some regrets in your personal life and professional life?
15 slams is such an incredible accomplishment over a long period of time. what qualities are you most proud of that you brought to this achievement?
no, that you brought to achieving the record of 15 slams.
what does it say on your t-shirt?
how do you feel about being a legend, except feeling good?
where does that rate amongst your performances in recent years?
it seems like a lot of streams came together to make the river today: fitness, the backhand working. can you address that.
want to talk about larry's contribution to the success this week.
in previous matches with roger, how varied have your game plans been? he spoke earlier today that he felt as though almost every time he played you that you were trying different things, that it wasn't necessarily one approach. can you describe how varied your approaches have been?
in the third set tiebreaker, there were 16 points; you came to net eight times. what enabled you to pull the trigger?
a lot of good movement out there. also a lot of calm amidst the storm. talk about your feeling out there.
you said when you came off the court that you weren't sure, it's been a little while since you thought you'd make a grand slam final. did you ever really seriously doubt that you would be back here?
has this era of roger and nadal been a bit demoralizing for players at your level?
fantastic, but they seem to pick it up. they've cleared the grand slam circuit for a few years.
the thing that most pleased you today was the level of restraint and focus that you were able to keep against a player like murray, who sometimes draws lots of errors out of his opponents?
am i correct in saying that a year ago you were just coming through an airport lounge and you saw the last set of the federer/nadal final; is that correct?
were you coming back from here?
you're coming off two huge wins. what is going to be your approach for the next match against a tough competitor?
within yourself, what are your thoughts about the upcoming final?
you talked about your family. roger is a married man, too. how much of a role does your family play in your success of this year?
in the third set you were down a triple breakpoint early. looked like maybe it could get away from you. that set had a couple of ups and downs. do you think that was a decisive moment there?
in your mind, how do you change as a person and as a player since you got the chance winning a grand slam last time three years ago in the us open?
in your own mind, how have you changed as a person and as a player since the last time you got a chance of winning a grand slam?
can you describe to us how much you want this title, how much it means to you?
could you try?
what memories stay with you most from when you were in the finals here before?
what is your take on what the next three or four years hold for andy murray?
back to the conversation you had with your wife at the end of last year of whether you could play or not. what side did you take and what side did she take?
and she convinced you?
remember the line about not wanting to shoot bambi? was it weird playing a guy who was such an overwhelming sentimental favorite? and how much did you kind of make taking the crowd out of it part of your game plan?
you're obviously focused on what you're trying to accomplish here, winning your first wimbledon title and second grand slam. what sort of appreciation do you have for what your opponent is trying to do with getting his 15th and breaking that record of pete's?
does it help mentally that he finally lost the final here last year?
the other day you said in terms of the stones concert you had a better view of the action. not up to the first row yet, or where are you in the seating pattern?
did you feel you had the edge in vitality out there?
well, you just seemed more ready for the whole thing.
yes.
what's given you the greatest satisfaction as far as how you're playing in this tournament?
what happened to you on the stairs as you were leaving?
can you envision yourself lifting that trophy on sunday as the winner here?
when was the first time?
you're obviously thrilled to be in the final. it means so much to you. how do you guard against being the happy-to-be-there guy?
you said it was important to know what to expect when you go out there. have you any idea on sunday what the crowd will react to, maybe you beating the british guy?
you seem to have run into the roddick of 2003. were you expecting that?
how do you rate your own performance?
do you think you were playing too passive or he was playing too great?
were you surprised with the sheer quality of his play at the net?
did you have a knee problem during the match?
could you talk about andy's return? and secondly give us an assessment about the final. does he have a good chance against roger?
yes.
despite his record against roger?
overall, how would you assess this tournament?
on that point, you went a round further than last year; you're 22 years old. you'll leave here more convinced that you can win wimbledon now?
did you say something to the crowd at the end? what would you say to the fans about coming back stronger next year?
will you be able to move on from this, or do you think, you know, i lost to a better guy on the day?
will you have a break before you go back to the court?
are you aware of the level of support you've had back in scotland? how much do you appreciate that?
you've talked for years about your feeling for the us open. has to be more than just the surface. what do you like about that tournament?
i'm sure you'd like to clear up the code violation warning.
what is the overriding memory or lesson that you take from this slam to put into future matches?
roddick said because all the pressure was on you he could swing more freely than you. do you agree?
which part of your game do you want to improve the most?
talk about the matchup and shots between andy's serve and federer's incredible return of serve. how do you think that might work out?
you looked extremely smooth and fluent today. everything coming with ease. how do you feel yourself? did you enjoy the match? did you feel any nerves or tension?
this is your record seventh wimbledon final and your record twentieth grand slam final. if you win the championship, you'll go back to no.1 in the world. which of those numbers means most to you, or do any of them mean anything to you other than winning?
all sports have incredible records, marks. what does the history book mean to you?
certainly the record for grand slam victories in singles is the most important record in our game. could you comment on that particular record.
we had a few interesting moments in that match. do you remember the point when both of you came to the net and you tried to make the pass? tommy just waved his hand. did that affect you?
obviously not knowing which of the andys you're going to face, we'll ask you about both of them. when it comes to roddick, what do you remember most about your finals against him? how does his play now compare with then?
you made the point previously that although andy murray has a good record against you, you've actually beaten him when it counts most.
the form you're in at the moment, you must feel you have a great chance if you should play him again on sunday.
will there be more nerves for you, because it could be 15 if you win it?
you mean bigger than achieving roland garros?
you were more nervous about the fifth?
mentally?
have you been texting with your buddy, pete? is he coming? what's the report?
if you do meet andy murray on sunday, it would be strange, because most of the crowd will actually want andy to win because he's a brit. how will you deal with that, or doesn't it bother you?
what do you think pete sampras' legacy is? what did you admire the most in his game?
what has been your approach to all the talk about whether you are indeed the greatest of all time? how would you describe what your approach has been? how much do you listen to it? what do you think about it?
have you enjoyed these discussions, hearing about it?
we have a revival of the, new balls please generation here in wimbledon. is that because experience is very helpful especially on grass, or are there other reasons for that?
you've won a lot of big matches over your career. does this one rank up there recently in importance when you add it all up, the opponent, the stage, five sets?
what was the toughest portion of that match for you?
right at the end of the match it was pretty obvious that you were emotional. what exactly were you feeling at that moment there?
have you got anything left in the tank for andy murray?
a lot was made after monday's game about andy murray's recovery, that he's only 22. you have four years on him. is that a significant time in tennis or are you still there or thereabouts at the same level as a 22-year-old?
yes. is it a significant time factor, that four years, in your recovery compared to his?
lleyton hewitt thinks you'll have to play a helluva match to beat andy murray, thinking you're very much the underdog in this game.
do you feel that way? do you agree with that?
you hit 43 aces in the match. you came up with huge serves. impossible to point out which was the biggest. can you talk about your serving, what role that played in the match.
were you consciously going for more?
take us through the break game in the fifth set. pretty incredible. two fighters. not certain which way the match is going to go.
did he surprise you? because he seemed to get injured midway through the second set, but he kept going.
is there a more mentally tough opponent out there than lleyton hewitt?
you've had many games with andy. where would you put his return of serve, given it's such a massive part of your game, the serving option?
if it should rain on friday and the roof is required - i'm sure you don't want to think about this - but do you have any concerns about taking a few moments to get used to how the ball might behave, or the fact that murray has had a chance to experience that?
andy said it's very humid in there and the court plays a bit slower. if they do have to use the roof, is that going to play against you friday?
you've had some trouble with murray since you started playing. the rivalry has evolved. you played him eight times. do you have to play your best, best, best? and has your game improved enough during this year when you face him to get him if he's playing at a high level?
you said when you came off the court that you felt like you've been out of the picture. do you feel now with two slam semifinals that you are back in the picture?
do you step on the court and think of yourself as the best server in tennis?
we're unused to this kind of weather in this country. is it fair to say you kind of grew up in this kind of stuff, your tennis education anyway?
so this really is nothing to you?
what are you expecting from the crowd? what do you think the atmosphere is going to be like here playing against andy murray in a semi?
last year after your tough loss, you said it was like watching a rolling stone concert from the eighth row when you're used to seeing it from the first row. what row are you in now?
who do you think rick astley will be rooting for?
what is your assessment of how andy murray has improved since this time last year?
is it possible to grind with him and win?
what are your thoughts on roger now reaching the 21st straight semifinal?
what do you think are the weaknesses of andy murray's game?
are you an admirer of murray? do you like his style?
what do you respect and admire most about the williams sisters on the other side, the way they've dominated here?
how does your maturity play into a match like that? do you feel almost a sense of calm at all?
what was your verdict on that performance?
physically you were happy?
little bit of an adjustment monday night being indoors to being in the breeze and sun?
you have a winning career record against roger federer, but today he reached the semifinals for the 21st straight time. he's tied with pete sampras for the majors record. when you think of roger federer's accomplishments, what has made him the player he is? what stands out most for you?
you seem to be dealing well with the hype and pressure surrounding you. that's building as we get towards the semifinal. how are you doing that? do you feel you're handling it better than in previous years?
having come through that, having won comfortably today, do you feel unstoppable now? do you feel this is the best tennis of your life?
is this the best consistency you've had in your career?
you're the youngest one in the final four. you're the only one whose age is under 25. apparently you have two generations here. how do you assess the players of your age's performance compared to the older ones in this tournament?
did you know that miss scotland was coming down to watch you?
are you pleased she made the effort to come and see you?
have you ever played tennis with her at all?
were you aware that kate winslet was there? are you pleased she was cheering you on?
following from your messages from the queen and sean connery, have you had any other notable messages this week?
the weather forecast for friday isn't great. do you have any fears of playing under the roof again?
do you hope you get a bit more warning this time, though?
what was your recovery like yesterday after the match on monday?
were you surprised at all that the court was a third empty when you came on?
do you think in any of your matches yet that your game has peaked, or do you think there's still another level you can reach?
i wanted to ask you about your serve today. you hit your fastest serve of the tournament today. did you feel that was a platform for your success?
ferrero just said the match very much turned in the 10 minutes of the second set when you broke him twice. he felt you raised the aggressivity of your game in returning to his serve. was that a conscious decision, or did it just happen?
you mentioned your ashes-themed forfeits last week. can i just ask how much of a fan of cricket are you, and who are you going to be supporting next week?
how do you feel about jamie going through today after the year he's had?
you spoke a moment ago about what strikes you most about roger federer. how about the williams sisters? what goes through your mind when you consider their dominance?
given that roddick and hewitt are 4-all in the third, would you talk about the challenge that each of those would pose for you.
looks like their match is going to be a tight one. is it going to help you the fact you wrapped it up in three sets today?
are you going to meet up and discuss your respective matches with jamie, take some time to relax together?
was it quite a shock to be broken already in your second service game?
you felt better after you took the sunglasses?
did it affect you psychologically losing that service game? did you find it hard after that?
can you explain what roger does differently than other players with your serve? does he hit it back sooner, or is it clear to you why he can handle it a little bit better than others?
just better in general, not a specific thing he does?
did you believe at one point that you could turn it around or...
was it a bit of a shock to get broken so quickly in the match today, after having served so well?
what was your level today? do you think you played a good match? was it just roger, or you could have played better?
can you identify any weakness in roger's game? is there something you try to exploit or attack about the way he plays?
did your serve suffer because of the problems with the sun? how did it affect you?
you've played roger a lot of times now. how well do you think he's playing at the moment?
have you seen a player out there, that if roger plays like this, you think he can beat him?
how is it different to play roger on grass? you have played him on every surface. how is it different to play him here?
how much of a boost has it been for you to reach the quarterfinals here?
do you have any problem with the hand?
had you ever had no chance in a tiebreak after hitting all first serves in?
did you get a sense, maybe even from early on, that federer was able to read your serves better than other opponents, that he was able to tell where the serves were heading?
what was it that made you nervous? the fact you were playing on centre court, the quarterfinal, or the fact it was roger on the other side of the net?
hard to combat that service game of andy's?
you were clutching your leg at times. how big a factor was that?
double-faults early on. was that an issue with your serve?
in a few days when the disappointment of this match subsides, how do you think you'll look back on the championships as a whole?
you've seen andy roddick's game in all the different stages of his career. what are your thoughts on the way he's playing right now?
what are your thoughts on the matchup, andy versus andy?
how much does a five-setter like that take out of you physically and mentally?
a lot was made of murray's recovery after the game on monday, the fact he was 22. andy roddick is only four years older. will that be a significant factor?
andy said after the match that maybe going back five years, six, i don't know how many years, might have been a bit sort of fi or scrappy between you two. but i think his quote was, we're just a couple of old married dudes now. it was a different sort of sense of the match. did you feel that as well?
take us through the break game late in the fifth.
compare andy's serve to the other great serves that are in the game today.
the umpire missed a call or the linesman didn't make a call, and andy was disputing it at the change of ends. did you get a sense he got a little distracted at that point?
did you have trouble with your grip there a few times?
you've moved forward in the rankings now. look forward to the next slam, the tournaments in between?
do you go back there with more belief than you might have had after this sort of week and a half?
a lot of players have had serious setbacks and great comebacks late in their career. how does this period now where you're fighting back compare with the early days where you had all your great triumphs?
in some ways is it even more satisfying now?
has your performance here suggested that you're ahead of where you perhaps expected to be, or have you sort of performed as you expected to coming in?
if you'd played murray, it would have been a nice ashes appetizer. who is going to win the ashes?
are you surprised what happened, or after what happened in queen's you were pretty confident you could repeat?
are you reviving serve and volley, tommy?
what was the difference that turned around the match against roger at the french open? why do you think he was able to win that match?
he said belief was the difference. that his belief is what carried him through that match. how did you see that manifest itself?
you have had a lot of struggles and injuries. you're getting older. is there still unresolved business, a big statement you could make career-wise?
can you mention or say a couple words about tough matches you've lost here or the tough issues you've had here physically.
compared to someone like federer who is playing 21 semifinals in a row in the grand slams, do you think you were a little bit unlucky in your career when you look back? past is past, as you say, but a little bit unlucky.
can you explain why it has always been worth it to you to put in all the work that has been required to come back from some of these setbacks? what is it about tennis that makes you always keep putting in the time?
when you eventually retire and look back, would you see roger's inside-out forehand as the foremost opposition shot that you faced in your career that impacted your career?
if you could pick up a surface, you have to play federer, you can choose between indoor, grass, clay, and hard, where would you list first, second, third, and fourth?
no, the one you would prefer, then going down.
what about the others?
wimbledon has been a happy hunting ground for german tennis players in the last 25 years. are you beginning to believe that you might be able to follow in their footsteps?
novak spoke of feeling quite nervous out there. did you notice that? do you think maybe your age and experience were telling out there today?
you mentioned a moment ago that your next opponent will probably go down as the greatest player ever. what do you marvel at most when you consider what has made roger the greatest?
everything.
are you sick of look at that guy's serves?
is he the most boring player to play against? it's serving and walking from right to left, left to right.
before the tournament started, you said you wouldn't start thinking, it wouldn't creep into your mind, about pete's record until maybe the semifinals. now you're here. what are your thoughts about pete's slam record and your opportunity here at wimbledon this year?
and your thoughts on the significance of that slam record or major record?
ivo said that as much as you're better than the rest on all surfaces, on grass you become impossible. what adds the difference on the grass?
no one touched karlovic's serve during the grass court season. today he hit some big bombs at you and you're just reflexing back winners. do you see the ball better than most other players do?
you're understandably a private man, but you're approaching this wonderful week in tennis history. at the same time, you're going through an experience of becoming a parent. can you share a little bit of how you're juggling those and dealing with those.
you played haas on clay, and maybe clay is not your favorite surface.
may is not the favorite surface of haas either. do you think on grass he's even more dangerous than on clay? what do you think?
21 semifinals is certainly a testament to your excellence, but it also means you show up at every major. can you talk about your durability a little bit. why do you think you're so durable when other players seem to break down at some point?
is there any chance in the world that you'll be involved in coaching after your career?
can it be taught?
looking at the list of the final eight players, you, roddick, hewitt, ferrero, all from your generation. are you happy or surprised that your generation is playing great in this tournament? do you feel a bit of not lonely anymore with all the young guns around?
what is your sense of appreciation for the williams sisters' dominance on the other side of the draw?
what do you appreciate most when you do watch them?
when you've been playing a guy like haas for as long as you have, do you find yourself having to change strategies, and do you find the other veteran players changing strategies against you?
when you're playing a guy like haas or juan carlos or hewitt or any of the guys who you've been playing for a long time, do you find that the strategies they use against you or you against them have changed over the years?
of all your accomplishments, how important is it to you, the 21 straight semifinals?
against tommy at the french, what do you think it was that carried you through that match most of all?
just near the end when you got the mini break up, he knocked back a forehand winner to you and you got a pretty big smile on your face. it seemed to suggest, that's all i have; you're too good. would you say that summed it up?
you've played him 11 times now and lost 11 times. going into a match like that, do you think this might be your time?
are you getting closer to him or not?
how are you feeling physically compared to the other day?
have you ever served so well and still lost a match?
if you could pick a game you would like to play against him, with federer, out of tennis, what would it be?
do you now think that roger will go on to win wimbledon?
he only broke your serve once. did that surprise you?
why the marathon?
comparing to other matches against federer, what do you think about his performance today?
did you find him harder or easier to come up against than in france?
was it as straightforward as the scoreline would tell?
there's lleyton now.
what are your thoughts on him as an opponent?
is there a feeling among your peers that he's really on his way back now?
what was the key to you turning the rivalry into your favor in 2005? because he had a very good record going into cincinnati then, and now you've won the last four straight.
how different is your sense of appreciation for advancing at this time with this maturity that you have versus several years ago here?
the other day you said that it's tough to compare years, conditions are different, players are different, just about everything is different. how about your game? if you were to stack up your game today and your satisfaction with it versus years ago, where does rate?
i understand you're quite friendly with justin timberlake and that he came to see you on saturday.
he likes you.
absolutely.
no word from rick?
are you hoping to hear from rick? he's aware of your passion for him and his music.
your call with barack obama after the match, what did he advise you of the hewitt match coming up? (laughter.)
you probably weren't really that concerned about this, but did you feel they pulled the trigger a little bit early on the roof, considering it was pretty dry the last few hours?
the tiebreak was your friend again today, huh?
are you feeling pretty confident when you get to that point in the set?
could you describe what it's like to play against hewitt, for those of us who never have.
he's got this huge knot of fans that are very, very noisy in their support for him. can that be off-putting for you? is that a big weapon in his armory, or not?
i know you're saying you don't want to go back and talk about evolution of game...
i'm gonna talk about game now. but if you look at lleyton's game from 2001 to 2009 coming off the hip surgery, do you find he's a little bit different? he's not counterpunching as much now? a little bit more aggressive? does he come in a little bit more?
speaking of earlier in this decade, is this starting to look a little bit like an aarp convention here in the draw with haas, ferrero, and hewitt, all the old guys in there?
do you personalize that at all? are you heartened by the fact that you can see a comeback even from hip surgery and make a deep run?
did you do anything exciting on the rest day yesterday?
what did you do?
who do you think the two or three best movers in the game are now?
how is the grass playing? speeding up as the tournament is going on?
what are your emotions right now?
must give you a lot of confidence to have won such a match. can you actually win wimbledon? does that actually come into your mind after winning a match like that?
in what way are they different?
did the court play differently?
were you surprised that you started the match under the roof, or did they consult with you?
did you have a problem with the lights when the sunlight was still there as well?
is it fair to say then you would much rather play without the roof than with it closed?
did you think overall the conditions helped your game or hindered it?
how long was it actually before the start of the match that you were actually told definitely you would be playing under the roof?
would you put your performance in that first set down to the conditions?
what's the game plan for tomorrow?
can it be an advantage for you in the next rounds that you will have played under the roof and your opponents with not have?
how concerned were you to receive the letter talking about ball-boys being sent home because of flu-like symptoms?
ball-boys and ball-girls.
did you feel something of the character of the tournament changed a little bit tonight in terms of the atmosphere? it's a departure, the fact we're playing 20 till 11:00 at night. but the atmosphere was more boisterous maybe than it has been before because of the roof and the lights.
it seemed deafening for us watching it. was it a help or hindrance, all that extra noise?
you seemed to be encouraging the crowd.
would you like to see night sessions here one day in the future?
how would you assess the quarterfinal challenge you have? will the queen's result have any bearing on it?
can it be an advantage to have a five-setter at this stage, or is it a hindrance in terms of sapping your energy?
what happened there with your thigh?
it was like a different game from then on.
did the treatment do the trick, or were you pushing through a bit of pain in the last three sets?
sometimes if you cool down during the delay, it might come up again.
will you have to have any more treatment? are you confident it's going to be all right for the next match?
what was going through your head? you're two sets down, probably hurting a bit. are you thinking, i might be out of here?
are you starting to feel the invincibility of the days when you were first in the world?
going back maybe 18 months, two years, do you think you would have been able to pull out a comeback like that with the state your body was in back then?
you made a point of going over to thank your supporters. how much of a role did they play in lifting you today, and how much have they helped you through the tournament?
given the australia/england thing, do you particularly want to play murray?
how do you feel about andy roddick? can you turn around that result from queen's, do you think?
with andy roddick, you're both veterans on the tour. probably nothing that is going to surprise him about you, and vice versa. how do you go about preparing matches against an old rival like that?
the fans today, are they the same guys that have followed you over the years?
you haven't got them tickets?
is he here, wozza?
do you think it gets annoying or a bit unfair for your opponents when you've got them being quite as loud as they were today, being told by the stewards a couple of times to tone it down?
bec sort of left. not sure whether she needed a comfort break. she came back at the start of the third. are you superstitious who is in your entourage, where they are?
that was a very convincing win. everything went perfectly for you today.
quiz question first: do you know who the last 30-year-old to win wimbledon was?
male. do you think can you do it?
arthur ashe in '75. it's quite a leap.
how have you kept going? any secret to it?
it's been a good season on grass, hasn't it, after the win in halle? feeling comfortable on the surface?
everybody is talking about the grass slowing down. if this tournament continues on form through this week, it seems to have the most number of aces ever recorded by men in a grand slam. surprise you or...
you mentioned before that you've been out, you're in, how quickly things can change. you find yourself in the elite 8. you had roger down two sets in paris. it seemed that he was sort of settling into the no.2 spot. now if he wins this tournament after what happened in paris he'll be no.1 again. is that something that surprises you at all, how quickly things can turn around in this sport?
is there a question about that greatest of all time on the basis that he's had not a great record against nadal, who is his closest peer in his age group?
were you convinced that was going to go into a fourth? the way the serves were coming down, tiebreaks all around.
a letter has gone out from the club about some ball-boys being sent home with flu-like symptoms. what have you been told and are you concerned about it?
there's obviously a lot of pressure on andy murray this fortnight. is it helping you, the fact that all the eyes aren't on you for once?
do you prepare any differently for a match against someone you know you have that 10-0 record against?
you said you've been quite pleased with how you've played, how you've made it through to this point. what have you been most pleased with so far in your game?
is there a way to explain a period where you go through and you say you feel uneasy, unsure of which shot to play, after so much success, is that just basically the human mind or the human brain at work?
how do you prepare to play against someone against ivo karlovic?
but in practice sessions...
i know, but when you practice, do you practice returning this serve?
despite last year's final, do you still regard this court like home cooking? it's like coming home to this court?
the first time you were on the centre court, was there a feeling of awe or fright? rod laver said he just wanted to leave as soon as he could; he was overwhelmed.
i think tennis fans would find it interesting that you have sort of all the scouting reports in your brain ready to go. is there an example of where you really have had to change a scouting report and approach against a major player?
does an example come to mind where you changed your strategy or approach with a particular player?
how have you been killing time away from the court? do you stay around wimbledon? do you get to go into london itself?
verdasco might be your next round opponent. that match is going on now with karlovic. what is your scouting report on him and the different type of challenge he would be for you?
your concentration on some key points was quite impressive. also giving the history of court 3, can you elaborate on that?
you will be the last player to win on that court.
you play tommy haas next. can you turn around halle? what went wrong in halle and what will go right this time?
you seem to be more serious these days than you used to be.
is that right, or am i getting the wrong impression?
serious question, novak.
fourth seed on court 3. were you surprised to be out there in such an important game?
your form has been a little bit variable this season. is it much to do with the change of racquet or your health?
as far as you're concerned, is your form coming good at the right time for wimbledon?
players have talked a lot about the courts having got slower. we seem to be on the way towards a grand slam record in number of aces being hit this tournament. can you explain that?
you just played a young israeli tennis player, dudi sela, who is ranked way below where you are located. how would you impressed by his tennis today?
the rest day in the middle of wimbledon, is that a bigger advantage to the bigger players or the unknown players?
the sunday off. is that a big advantage to the big players?
have you got a cold?
we thought you were going to retire, but you managed to get on.
how confident are you you'll be okay for your next match?
where is your doctor coming from?
how do you feel about lleyton hewitt as an opponent?
is he particularly difficult if you're not fully fit?
most of the players play with racquets from the major manufacturers. you play with a different racquet. could you tell us about that and why?
what is the key element that they've customized for you?
you and tomas are doing very well in this tournament. does this give you a lot of confidence for the next davis cup tie?
did you expect to get to the fourth round taking into account your knee problem?
what is the problem? you say the knee gave way. something you didn't suffer before. it's a pain?
if you win this tennis tournament, will you do the worm for us?
how would you sum up that performance?
you walked in with a stat sheet in your hand. what do you look at, and what can you tell by looking at that?
did you have any problems with the ankle you injured at queen's?
going back to the stat sheet, how closely does that conform to what you feel when you're on the court? are you blown away sometimes, or is it pretty much what you expect?
a lot of the older, more experienced guys like yourself and lleyton hewitt and tommy haas are all doing really well here. do you think a lot of the young guys don't get the grass yet and it helps that you're back year after year?
are there still even more gears to go up in the second week?
in the fourth set, you were up a break, got broken back, then broke right back. are you more inclined to be upset at yourself for getting broken, or pat yourself on the back for responding immediately and breaking right back?
how different do you consider your game today than it was when you made it to the finals here in the past?
if you were to compare, in terms of which you think is a stronger game, your game today versus when you made it to the finals in the past, for you which is the stronger?
do you feel you're playing better than '04?
in baseball over the past decade or so with bill james, a whole bunch of stats like batting average, win/loss record have sort of been undermined a little bit. do you think there are any stats in tennis that are not so useful, or should there be any changes in the field of stats?
yes.
wimbledon has the off day. makes monday pretty unique. you have the whole fourth rounds of the men's and women's. talk about that day in the calendar. a lot of tantalizing matches.
berdych can be almost as good as anybody on his day. how do you feel about playing him? do you think he's a guy that if he plays his very best is just about as good as it gets - on his best day?
what is the difference between finishing the year no.1 and just getting the no.1 ranking? what's the difference in your mind to those two different accomplishments?
you said in the tv interview about the roof. has there been a lot of talk in the locker room among the guys who may be the first one to play under it?
you spoke a bit about tomas. when you've played him in the past, he's given you so much trouble. what are the common dominators there? what is it about his game that's been so difficult for you?
how does, if at all, starting the second week at a grand slam change your attitude, your preparation?
you've been with larry for a while now. what's the best part of him when it comes to preparing him for a match? what do you appreciate the most in him getting you ready?
do you feel any stronger in this tournament going into the second week than in the past?
how much of a motivator for you was last year's showing here, which was not up to the standards you'd established here?
and this year that latter feeling, as well?
can i get your thoughts on the press? how much do you like or dislike dealing with the press, having to talk from everything from rick astley to the game?
in a press conference with several people. as a kind of whole, what do you make of all of us here now?
federer is one of the worst challengers. does that surprise you? what do you think of that?
tiebreaks, you've had a really great record so far this year. obviously that came into play today. are you feeling a little mojo when you get to that point in the match?
how much during a tournament like this do you scout yourself possible future opponents, watch them? even berdych, those guys, do you watch a tape of any of that?
how polished a performance do you think that was?
stanislas wawrinka told us you're quite good friends. can you talk a little bit about your relationship with him.
how would you sum up your first week here? has it gone even better than you might have expected?
is it special having a guy like chris hoy in the royal box watching you?
was he complimentary afterwards?
there was a suggestion that your mum left halfway through the game after a disagreement with somebody in the crowd. have you spoken to her? can you shed any light on that?
it goes up a whole level obviously next week. do you feel you've been stretched and tested to the right extent?
were you worried it was starting to rain at the end?
we expected you to go second on court. you were on third. did you want third?
i think there were 24 olympic champions there today. is that a humbling experience, and did you get to meet any of the others afterwards?
can you talk about stan's game on monday, what you're going to be looking out for.
you're playing so well. there's going to be a huge ramping up of expectations next week. do you have a strategy for dealing with that, you and your team?
do you feel different this year in terms of how the first week has gone?
you've been responsible for the most addictive game during wimbledon 2009, matching players with different foods. you've had lleyton chewit, vania king size mars bar, but has anyone come up with a name for you this year?
what's your favorite one?
what's your favorite one for your name?
your game sometimes involves covering a lot of the court. how different do you find that on grass compared with clay or hard? and do you like it better?
you state really clearly this year you want to win the tournament. is this also kind of a strategy? you could also keep the ball low and say, i don't want to make the pressure bigger by stating that you want to win the tournament. you're making the pressure even bigger. this is also a strategy?
you obviously do play up to the last ball. is there any point at which you know you've won or lost a match?
do you know yet how you'll be spending tomorrow?
you said you watched some of roger's match yesterday. how closely do you pay attention to the others in the draw, your rivals in this kind of championship?
you told us before the tournament started that you got a few dvds in to sort of relax in front of. can you give us a clue of what you've been watching in your off time?
are you a rugby fan? will you be watching a rerun of the lions at all?
was that tim henman you're talking about?
did you invite him in, or what was he doing there?
tim said on the jonathan ross show that it's definitely still henman hill. is that something you'd agree with?
when you practice with someone regularly, as you do with stan, does it change your approach to a match? does it make it easier or harder because you're so familiar with each other's game?
with everybody else talking about it, do you ever at any moment find yourself drifting towards thinking about federer versus murray next sunday?
what did you do last night to relax and prepare yourself again for this morning?
how do you feel now?
after a marathon game like that, is it understandable to you why perhaps rafael nadal decided not to play wimbledon?
with your play here and at the french open, also the lead-up tournament into wimbledon, what do you attribute your resurgence to?
was that federer match, do you think, a major breakthrough for you, even though you lost?
what do you tell yourself when you're walking on centre court knowing that in one break the match is over?
how about this morning? how was it coming back out just to finish off?
were you very nervous this morning?
what did you do last night in order to try and relax?
do you think that you've learnt a lot from this match for next year, and for the us open you'll be more prepared if you get into these situations?
unlucky today. can you describe the experience of being aced 46 times in a match? can you describe what that feels like?
do you feel helpless? there's nothing you can really do about it when somebody is serving like that?
do you think, with that serve, he can go a lot further in the tournament?
how about your own level today? are you happy with the way you played?
how do you mean, you didn't play?
you looked to be getting very frustrated out there.
is he the best server you've played against?
before the match you said it will be a mental battle. did you expect such a tough mental battle?
did you have high hopes of getting far in the tournament before the start?
you must be delighted with your performance today.
given how so many of your matches go, is there anything specific you can do to prepare for tiebreakers? is that something you work on with your coach?
when you start a match, your game is different than most players, but are there one, two, three checks that you say, i must do this, i must do this, i must do this?
in the next round you are playing verdasco, whom you beat in nottingham. a few words about verdasco and federer.
are you getting angry about persons who are saying you can just serve and that's all?
was goran one of your idols when you were growing up, starting out?
was he somebody you modeled your game after?
your record here the last four years has been not very good. one would think your game would be more successful here. how do you explain that?
could you sense tsonga getting frustrated out there?
do you think it's going to be more difficult this year than in nottingham against verdasco?
roger federer, everybody gives him compliments. you do this. you do that. what is the best compliment you've had about your game from somebody?
did some person say something to you that you have a fantastic serve or the way you play is unique, something like that?
can you name any player who gave you a compliment, a player we would know who said something?
you had your own clothing label. what happened with this? do you still have it?
how good is novak playing?
do you think we should factor him into the picture of next weekend?
how was it out there for you?
people have been saying the courts are slowing down, the grass is slowing down for years. do you sense a difference now compared to other years?
when goran was coming on in his heyday, he was blasting a lot of aces. one theory was that the authorities were pretty cautionary about it. the surface getting too fast, do you think that's kind of what happened?
sounds like you're a bit uncertain.
what has he improved since you played him last in a big match?
when push comes to shove in terms of your run here at wimbledon, would you say deal or no deal?
so that sounds like a deal?
a guy doesn't get to play that court very often. when you're out there, any chances to appreciate the moment?
anything in particular that strikes you sitting on the chair during a changeover, maybe something we wouldn't notice?
when you say you're trying to figure out how to play on the grass, are you caught between the reputation of the grass and what it meant when you were growing up?
other players this week have said that the grass courts are starting to play a bit more like hard courts or some have said a bit more like clay courts. did you notice which direction they might be going?
what is the verdict on that today?
good for you terms of the tournament to have had more of a test?
where were you and what were your immediate thoughts when you heard the news that michael jackson had died?
what do you consider the aspect that you appreciate the most of his performances?
a lot of people are inevitably already speculating, looking at the draw, a possible federer/murray final. i presume you feel that's fairly premature at this stage, would you?
in a few weeks, nelson mandela is going to be honored in our country. could you comment about your thoughts on him and your meeting him?
what do you think his legacy is?
before playing the wimbledon final, you will replay the roland garros final next round. what is your feel being playing soderling once more? can he be more dangerous on grass than clay?
your wife is pregnant obviously. would you be happy if she gave birth in england? would you be happy to have a son or daughter born in england?
you broke agassi's record today. 47th win.
yes.
does that mean anything at all?
just another record?
fabrice santoro has played his last singles match here. are there any shots in his armory that you would have liked to have had or you'd like to acquire? it seemed when you played him you actually had quite a lot of fun. what was it like playing against him?
that santoro forehand, do you ever practice that?
because of the unique day off here on sunday, is there more of a sense here than anywhere when you get to the second monday it's almost the start of a new tournament?
when you enter a match against soderling with such a lopsided record in the past between the two of you, does that enter your mind at all either as a confidence boost, thinking he never has beaten you on any surface anywhere, or is there part of you that thinks maybe at some point he's got to win against me?
you're playing so well through the first three rounds, yet it seems that you're getting very little respect for being a top four seed. another strong win again today. why do you think you're not getting the kind of respect that a top four seed deserves?
in what way do you think it's an advantage to be under the radar a little bit?
after today, that could change. that could have been a very complicated match for you, but you took control of it very early, played extremely well.
do you think you are playing well enough at the moment to go all the way in this tournament?
do you think it would be silly of other people to underestimate you?
given that the grass isn't playing like a hockey rink, that you've had a lot of success on fast surfaces outside of grass, there shouldn't be a reason why your style can't fit into grass, no?
you have a pretty complicated relationship with the crowds. it was not too long ago where after the matches, especially at the us open, you were doing your impressions. seemed like you were everybody's new favorite player. seems like in the last year, perhaps because maybe you offended the wrong people with certain impressions, seems like you're a more reserved character, don't care about what the crowd thinks anymore. is that true? do you care?
you said at the beginning that all the attention's been on roger and andy, and deservedly so. is that because of roger's rsum at wimbledon and andy's been playing fairly well recently? talk about what that has to do with you. i know you've had some bumps in the road this year, but you've also been pretty consistent.
is it special having your brother in the stands cheering you on and cheering every point?
you made a great performance of thriller in monte-carlo a few years ago.
by youtube. how are your feelings about his death?
how would you assess that performance? is there any disappointment for you to get broken and lose a set, or you come out with a win and a win is a win?
somebody was mentioning you and lleyton both winning today. you've been sort of the standard bearers of your countries for seven or eight years. do you feel like there's nobody behind you? i wonder how lleyton feels about the same thing. you just keep rolling along and there's no successor.
do you feel a burden? it's an individual sport, but do you feel any sort of burden in sort of carrying the weight?
a question about your twitter account. what made you do that? do you have fun? do you update it yourself?
do you have fun updating it?
so can you talk us through rick astley here?
you can get arrested in this country for having rick astley on your ipod.
how did it come about, this passion for rick astley?
your next opponent is an austrian, jurgen melzer. spoke to him before. he said you're good friends. is it like that? would you explain this friendship a little bit?
he's your opponent now. what do you think?
wimbledon hopefully will be two weeks for you. is the two weeks all pressure, pressure, pressure, or in downtime can you have fun and enjoy yourself? do you constantly feel under pressure?
does it help listening to rick astley?
you played lleyton at queen's. have you been surprised with the result he had today? could you see that result coming?
do you find some of the younger american players come to you for advice, pick your brain at all, even particularly playing at a place like this where you've had success?
jesse levine is playing today, a qualifier. do you know him at all?
have you had contact with him? has he asked you for any advice?
what are your thoughts on shaq being traded to cleveland?
what do you think it will do to james and the cavs for next year?
if i have that right, there are three guys from your high school still in the draw.
so talk about what's in the water there.
if they said to you years ago there are three left in the draw, what would you have said? any idea that would happen?
was your high school tennis team undefeated, or did you go down sometimes?
friendships aside ahead of your next game, i think you have an 8-0 lead, but you haven't met on grass. do you think that might make a difference?
talking about jesse levine, he's recently taken on a sport mental coach. i think it's the same one that ivan lendl used. a few years ago you had taken a look into bringing someone like that onto your group.
you did.
truth be told, who was better in high school in basketball, you or mardy?
go to the hoop?
you said you like going into london for dinner. i hear you enjoy going to the ivy.
been there this year?
thoughts on the nba draft, predictions?
what do you think of the first pick?
you don't follow it at all?
if you had to pick one nba star to be a prospect on the tour, who would you go with?
any other favorite spots in london that you like?
how many marks out of 10 would you give that one?
anything at all that you came off the court wishing you had done any better? it seemed almost perfect.
have you ever made less than five unforced errors in a three-set match?
quite impressive, isn't it? shows how together you were.
how much of a surprise was it to get a letter from the queen?
what did it say?
have you had any other interesting letters from people that you didn't expect?
i don't know if you heard, but had you a proposal of marriage at some stage during that match. are you comfortable with receiving that sort of attention?
you said at the end of last year you had two ambitions. one was to win wimbledon and the other was to pass your driving test. have you had any time to having any driving lessons, and have you taken your test yet?
the day before yesterday you talked about the roof. did you notice the roof again? did it trouble you at all?
can you tell us a little bit about the forfeits you've been handing down to members of your coaching team?
do you have any thoughts about the next round?
just you left now representing us. poor nation. it was bound to be most possibly you in the end anyway going the farthest. does that sadden you in a way?
how important are the forfeits and things like that in a big pressure tournament to have a bit of relief?
the third match of the day seems to be your regular slot now. are you happy with that? it does mean that you can never be quite sure what time you're going on?
what was the atmosphere like out there with the crowd?
there may not be many other british tennis players for you to have a camaraderie with here. lleyton hewitt has been talking about how the australian sportsmen talk to one another. do you have communication with other british sports players?
sport in general.
for the consistency of the performance throughout, have you ever played a better match here, do you think?
just on the forfeits, they're very funny. but who chooses them? because you never seem to lose. is it you who sort of says you have to do this or whatever?
they haven't thought about maybe changing the game?
you told us your game plan the other day, and it seemed to go pretty much a hundred percent to the script.
just from your reaction, that seemed like a pretty special win.
the crowd seemed to be on your side. they gave you a great ovation there at the end.
did you feel like the underdog? are you surprised to have won?
kind of been waiting for a day like this for quite some time, haven't you, when everything works exactly the way you wanted it to work? how good did that make you feel?
is the hip completely fixed now?
how long before you've been able to play completely injury-free like that?
john mcenroe on the tv said it's the best he's seen you since 2002. would you follow that?
what do you feel when he says that you were an idol for him, and it was funny when you said, c'mon the first time he was in front of you?
how important is support from bec and your family?
can you take us back one year ago just before your surgery? did you ever have the temptation to say, i had a great career, i have a good family, it's enough, or not?
because of the weight of public expectation, is it in some ways easier for you to be playing here than at the australian open? can you relate to what andy murray goes through at wimbledon during this fortnight?
what possible semifinal opponent for you now?
roger is going to be a father in just a little while. if you could give him one piece of advice of being a touring pro while being a dad, what would you say?
mostly be on her shoulders?
and you're pretty good at changing those nappies?
while you were on court, elena baltacha crashed out. just andy murray left. do you agree it's him flying the flag, and britons should be doing better here?
does it feel kind of weird coming out of tournaments when you're one of the older guys with players looking up to you as opposed to years ago when you were the guy looking up to other players? does it make you feel old at all?
have you set yourself that target? what would be a good wimbledon for you this year? what would you be happy with?
taking all that onboard, do you still feel you're a good enough player to go all the way in a grand slam tournament?
what did you think of your first centre court experience?
do you think he's improved a great deal since you last played him?
which area of his game do you think is the most dangerous?
federer is obviously the main challenge. do you think he can beat federer if he plays like that?
can he beat federer, do you think?
what do you think of his return of serve? in his half of the draw he has hewitt and roddick. they're obviously great servers. you have a big serve. how do you think he handles the big serve?
or waiting for your dropshots?
how is his slice to your backhand more difficult on grass than on a hard court?
any regrets over your comments regarding andy? you said the other day that he operated some gamesmanship at the match at queen's.
did you talk to andy about that today? did you clear it up?
have your coaches ever told you, this match, just for fun, no dropshots? have they ever had penalties for too many dropshots?
you had a forehand one i think when you lost your serve in the first set. it was a groundstroke, not a volley. do you remember that one? you missed the dropshot into the net on the forehand.
you've been undergoing a lot of intense physical training this year. you mentioned briefly how it sort of affects your game that you have to get used to sort of your new muscles in a way. can you maybe tell a bit about how far you are in that process.
the improvement in murray's fitness, is that a lesson for all the young players in how much it can improve your performance as well?
was it too easy today?
i think it was the same round you went out last year, right? you ever have the thought of that when you go out today?
when you look at mardy fish across the net, what do you see? what are his biggest strengths and challenges to you?
what do you think he's improved in the most?
you seem to be downbeat about your chances. clearly you have the game to trouble anybody.
is the crowd important to you here? do you try to build a relationship with the crowd?
when you try, what do you try to do?
you said that you're just as happy people aren't talking about you; that you're not the favorite. why is it that, and how is it different when you are one of the favorites for you psychologically?
you're fairly friendly with gulbis because you trained together.
you know andy fairly well. as a spectator, how interested are you in that match tomorrow? what do you think about it?
what have you made of all the hype surrounding andy murray at wimbledon?
what do you think of the hype that surrounds andy murray?
have you noticed anything in him? is he still relaxed on the practice courts?
you played on centre court the other night. you played on no.1 today. was any difference between them?
you were saying you felt at the australian this year you didn't handle the pressure as well as you could. do you feel that's true of your 18 months since you won the australian, or do you feel you've done yourself justice, perhaps?
clay, grass and hard courts, where would you put your confidence or your best game on the three surfaces?
grass is way down?
there's a story in the british press this morning about match fixing in tennis. can i ask you, have you ever experienced anything like that in your career?
when you watch roger federer, what do you appreciate most?
let me ask you about last year's olympic games. you were playing there, but there had been discussions about air quality before the games. were you actually worried going there playing? how did you feel when you were actually playing there?
is this really it, you and wimbledon?
how do you feel?
really?
don't wish you had a run like last year for your final wimbledon?
you played some great matches here at wimbledon. could you pick a couple of your favorites for us?
putting all the years together, how do you think in five years' time will you look back at wimbledon? will you have fond or bitter memories?
when we first saw you on the tour, many of us saw this big russian kid hitting hard, big win over sampras. how have you changed as a person and player since then?
one single thing in your career you could sit down and change?
if your mother hadn't been a tennis instructor, do you think you still would have had an interest in tennis and still would have pursued it?
do you think you were also born for sports or if you were put in school you might have gone in another direction?
when you set a date on retiring, is it hard to keep going? does it feel like you're going through the motions towards the end?
what are you most looking forward to next year when it's all over with?
you're such a free spirit, yet you said the game is so uptight, too many controls. what are your thoughts about that in general, and smashing a tennis racquet in particular?
do you think the rules and the code conducts should be changed so people can express their feelings?
what did you know about your opponent today before the match?
was there anything about his game that impressed you today?
in your wimbledon career, who do you rate as the best grass court player you faced?
we can probably assume grass was not your favorite surface. now that it's behind you, do you have any different feeling about it?
when people look back and say, hey, two majors, that's fantastic, but overall the guy has been an underachiever. i know you bristle at that. do you think there's any truth at all to that take on you as an under achiever?
so what should have been your overachiever mark?
is that the kind of match that you're just happy to see get out of the way?
after 12 minutes it was 5-love. you'd only lost three points. did you think you would be in for an easy afternoon?
great weather. obviously they don't need the roof today. when you're out there, do you glance up and take a look at it?
you've been on twitter a lot this week. how would you sum up your performance in 140 characters or less?
did you enjoy the hangover?
did you ever have a night like that yourself?
an ankle update, and just also assess how you felt out there today.
just assess how you felt out there today.
how did you find the condition of the grass, whether it was slippery or wasn't? was it a concern at any point for you?
question about american sports. you live in austin, the heart of longhorn territory, lifetime husker fan. now your brother is going to head the enemy. what are your thoughts about that?
it could lead to divorce from him?
nothing more important than husker football?
could you see any benefits from a broadcast, a fan, or an injury perspective of reducing best-of-five to best-of-three in the majors?
could you see any benefits from an injury perspective, broadcast, or fan perspective of reducing that?
you were asked about this in your tv interview after the match about all the hype being about roger and andy murray, that you were coming in slightly under the radar. can you expand on that a little bit. i believe you said you're fine with that.
how would you sum up your own chances then in case?
the fact that you are again in the top four, at least if you look in the book-making odds, that means something? it helps your confidence or not at all?
how much would you like to see another american guy, say sam or mardy, make a push to the second week here?
could you just assess how you feel they've been doing.
how much advice and encouragement do you give the other guys? they talk about you as a leader, even outside of davis cup.
a guy you haven't played is your next opponent.
what do you know about him?
do you like playing a guy you haven't played before?
how much do your past experiences here help you at this stage of your career?
obviously your focus is on your run here. you were talking about american tennis. any thoughts about your teammate, james, who got to a clay court final earlier, but has had some rough results?
close but no cigar, wasn't it? hard to take?
did last night's break hinder you at all?
any consolation that you've taken part in a good match, arguably the best match of the tournament so far?
you were 4-4 in that final set. it looked there at that point, you were dealing with your serve and you had got on top of his serve.
amazing service game, six or seven deuces. you served it out in the end. did you think at that stage you'd got him or you had the momentum?
what can you learn from that kind of experience, from that kind of defeat?
a year or so ago you would have got down on yourself after a result like this.
regardless of the fact you took it to five sets.
you also turned out for, i think, sutton tennis and squash club the last couple weeks.
what do you get out of it? is it that you're able to work on stuff?
last night you were banging down plenty of aces. today you weren't able to. was it the sun?
pleased with the way you carried on from there not serving aces but still winning service games?
jeremy said that you changed your racquet just before the start of the championships a couple of weeks ago, which is a bit of a gamble. he also seemed to think you played a hell of a lot better with a shorter racquet.
why?
what is your overriding emotion right now? do you feel pride in your performance, or are you frustrated at the big upset that just got away?
how determined are you to get what would appear to be the second singles spot on the davis cup team again?
how do you feel the season's going? are you happy with the way the season's progressing?
looking forward to the doubles?
pretty disappointing. you were in there each set. just didn't work out for you.
eight years in a row now, isn't it, that you've not got past the first round? how does that feel?
was there ever a time in those eight years that you thought you should have got through?
i think you have the worst record of any man here. how does that make you feel?
do you think you are getting better?
twelve months ago we sat in this room after your last defeat, and you said you were determined to keep coming back until you did win. is that still your mindset?
do you enjoy it here?
why do you do so badly then? why do you never win here?
there has been some questioning about the fact that you get a wild card all the time. do you ever think to yourself, oh, don't give me a wild card, let me try and qualify? do you ever have that in your mindset to ease the pressure in some way?
so you'll be back next year?
does it bother you that you get all this stick?
what do you think you'll do if and when you do finally win one? have you pictured that moment?
what about the davis cup? you didn't get picked.
what are your views on that as the no.2, not getting picked for the davis cup?
you're in the men's doubles. will you be entering the mixed doubles as well?
you'll have three shots at it this time?
how many years do you think you have left in you?
how did you feel after the french open? you did so well in the first round here.
everybody talks federer is very strong. you obviously played against him. so what is the biggest point of how strong he is? why?
presumably you would have cared for it to be a little bit quicker than that, the first match.
did you feel that you were getting more into your timing as the match went on?
you're confident that as the rounds go on that perhaps you won't have to go 3 hours 28 every round?
what is the special part of wimbledon for you?
it's not often you see a player have to call the trainer on a match point. what were you thinking?
was it particularly slippery out there today?
a lot of people are talking about andy murray, roger federer as the main title contenders. are you happy?
to be below the radar or hype in the building?
and we've spoken before about how you two developed together coming up through the juniors. is the ego kicking in a bit now?
john mcenroe said today from what he saw he thought you played too defensive. i wonder what you think about that claim?
obviously roger federer is one of the greatest players. as an opponent, what is his greatest point as a player?
after queen's, can you talk about the disappointment losing here first round.
the final tiebreaker, it isn't often that it gets away from you like that. did you feel it was your own errors there that was the cause, or his pressure?
there seemed like there were a lot of backhand-to-backhand rallies. am i right about that?
those two points in the tiebreaker, you talked to the umpire. did you think they were out?
this loss aside for a second, big picture, where do you think you're at right now with your tennis?
the fact you have so much experience, does that make it harder to accept or easier to accept?
could you please tell me what was more effective of the game of seppi? because normally he plays very well on the backhand, not so well on the forehand. what did you find more difficult to play against?
that court has a nickname and reputation. did that even remotely cross your mind at any point?
tens of thousands of players out there would die to have your career. could you talk a little bit more about the comment you mentioned, what's more frustrating, to have had the opportunity and not really been able to come through or to never have that opportunity.
how can you turn around your confidence?
you have a game that looks like it would translate well to grass. obviously you had some success at queen's. is it a movement issue? is it a footing issue for you on grass? is the grass here different than queen's in any way?
do you find when you're not feeling that confidence that maybe you're playing a little too safe?
you still plan on staying in europe before the davis cup?
did you have any physical problems today?
when you see a guy like nadal that's young and injured, do you ascribe any of that to the five-set format we have in the grand slams, or is it specific to him, do you think?
fewer masters?
how is your knee?
what were you thinking when you had to call the trainer on match point?
how did you manage? you saved the match point. how did you do that?
is that the biggest trophy you've ever won?
tough match, wasn't it?
you've won three titles on three different surfaces. your football team did pretty well last night.
wimbledon finals on the 4th of july this year. do you think it could be america's year?
you watched it last night?
did you watch it with mardy?
did you prepare for the match today with mardy?
warming up.
start of the week looking ahead, very strong field here. realistically what was your goal? how far did you see yourself going here?
a win like this must give you a lot of confidence giving to wimbledon?
is wimbledon sort of forming as a possibility in your mind? do you see yourself as a future wimbledon champion now?
what do players think of federer losing today in germany? does that perhaps give you hope or do you think that's maybe just a blip?
if there is one area of your game that you think you can improve on, what would it be, do you think?
what's your ultimate ambition in sports? what are you capable of by the end of your career?
there are some very famous names on that trophy: sampras, mcenroe. how does it feel your name is going to be up there?
if you could win one grand slam, which one would it be?
what's wimbledon mean to you?
an up-and-down match?
what happened in paris seem a really long time ago now?
when did you last feel like this, like having fun and enjoying it again?
really?
have your family traveled with you before? they're over here en bloc? how many family have you got with you?
was that the problem when you sort of high-tailed it out of roland garros? had you just sort of had enough of being on your own and europe and everything?
what did you do between then and now to refresh yourself?
do you find london a more agreeable environment than some of their european cousins?
is your mother staying over the whole time?
so who's cooking breakfast when they're way?
your game really looks amazing on grass. you have a big serve and you have a big game. a lot of people probably assume you're going to be a challenger on grass. is it a surface where you have to really learn, you have to put in your time on it to actually learn how to play on it?
somebody who stands as tall as you, how does the low bounce feel?
can you talk about your potential opponents in the final?
we had a spaniard here earlier in the week who served and volleyed just about every point, but very few players do now. what's your attitude, serving and volleying on grass?
you say it's the hardest surface of all, harder than clay. how do you come to terms with it? is it just patience, or somebody like roddick who initially had the same problems as you but now loves the stuff, have you had chats with him?
can you just elaborate? if it is mardy, you say he is one of your best friends. do you have any story about the two of you together?
just on the tour? i mean...
horrible clichd question, but will the two of you watch the football match tonight together?
are you a soccer fan?
just keeps gating better and better, doesn't it?
what was the crucial factor of the match today? what did you do that won it for you?
left-handers don't bother you or you don't mind them?
will it be special playing against sam? he's one of your mates?
who is that coach?
south african, isn't he?
how long have you been with him?
you've been coming here long enough to know the expectation that the british media and the british people put on britain's no.1 player, obviously is andy now that tim has retired. you've beaten him quite comprehensively the last few times you've played.
well, i think that he would suggest that you did. can you give us your thoughts on what that is like beating somebody, when you're in your own country, with such a championship as wimbledon and the way that you've probably done him a bit of harm psychologically this week?
he'll still be a threat?
did you sense anything on the court that his body language wasn't perhaps as positive as you've seen on previous occasions?
you play your tennis in a way that grass court purists like to see it played. where does that come from?
when you were a kid, did you watch anyone play serve and volley and think, i want to do that?
how much did you lose?
this is during the european swing, two finals with two americans?
will you watch the soccer match together tonight or not?
could you imagine walking in here tomorrow with the usa having beaten england in football tonight, and two americans on the center court?
is that an ice precaution or a problem?
you did say yesterday that you thought it might be a very difficult match. that's exactly what it was. he played brilliantly.
how do you feel your own game is?
were there any injury problems today?
do you feel ready for wimbledon?
do you know what time you will arrive in wimbledon?
what will you do over the weekend? will you do any work? will you pick up a racquet over the weekend?
this weekend.
do you think it matters that much whether you play three matches on grass, four matches, five matches before wimbledon?
does it matter that much that you play three or four or five matches or just that you've had some competition? does it matter how much matches you've played?
you were just saying that this weekend you will not pick up a racquet. will you do any sort of work? any sort of training at all or nothing?
will you do any sort of training? will you go for runs or you'll do nothing?
family and world cup?
is there any one reason why so many seeds have gone out? is that because of conditions here?
you have obviously played a lot of matches in the last two months. if you look at murray, roddick, djokovic, they have not played many matches. but would you rather be in your position maybe a bit more tired by having won more matches than to be fresh and not having won so much?
would you like one day to see there be a little bit more of a gap between the french open and wimbledon so we could have three weeks perhaps on grass?
your thoughts on that match?
you seemed a little kind of distracted from the outset yesterday and got off to a very slow start. was it then tough to get any kind of momentum at all?
but at the start of the third set again you had a little bit of a...
how much do you feel last night's suspension disrupted your momentum?
you made your feelings known on court. did you speak to anyone else last night?
did you speak to mardy about it in terms of him disappearing quite quickly?
is there a sort of feeling of general unsatisfaction the way it's all panned out as defending champion, you had a match last night stopped under very unhappy circumstances and this morning you sort of shoot out while you were trying to defend your title?
i mean, the circumstances...
does this disrupt your preparation for wimbledon at all, andy?
is your knee holding up okay? you have a brace on it.
compared to last year when you were obviously going like a train at this point, how short of that do you feel right now?
will there be any temptations to play an exhibition somewhere or would you stick to practice?
do you feel there is a sort of slight missing ingredient at the moment that you're trying to search for?
do you think it could be a help this year you'll go in with lower expectations, given the results...
do you sort of know when that is? like if something clicks when you're playing, you think, right, i've got it?
is this the most difficult transition in the year, do you think, from five sets of clay to three sets of grass?
something earlier in the week you mentioned about drug testing. were you tested again and again and again? as you expressed before, your irritation at the system, are you still irritated by the system?
this is a number of occasions you have expressed irritation. is there any feeling it's getting any better?
you've been in a couple of episodes recently where darkness has played quite a part in the outcome of situations. do you think it's about time that tennis took a view on this and maybe had light meters so we would know exactly where we stood?
when you say "we were talking," you mean the players were talking amongst themselves about...
that was put to the powers that be at roland garros, and they said, we're not even going to consider it because most of the officials are so experienced, they don't need a light meter.
it wouldn't be difficult to do, would it? i mean, you've got hawk-eye and everything like that in this day and age. if you have a light meter, it could be up on the scoreboard, a light reading.
which was worse, last night or the berdych match?
is that your best result playing on grass? you had a good wimbledon a couple years ago.
andy roddick said you played an almost perfect game and you had a very precise game plan. was a lot of thought that went into the match beforehand?
have you ever made a diving volley to win a match before?
do you practice it?
can you tell me what difference it makes when you come into a tournament, you look at a draw sheet and you're seeded?
what are your hopes for the tournament and for wimbledon?
what do you plan to do next week?
next week.
has there been any reaction to your injury and the treatment you had? has there been any reaction to your injury when you went down to see the physio? how is that now?
how did you do it? were you running and stretching?
when you say behind the leg, is it behind the knee or further up in the hamstring?
further up?
tight? little tight?
hamstring. and the conditions out there, so cold, so windy?
when was the last time you played in conditions quite as horrible as that today?
how do you stay focused in the rain delay, not knowing how long you're going to be off the court for?
when you have to maybe make a decision tonight about whether to go on or whether to say maybe it's better i don't play, do you ring uncle toni at home or do you make a decision?
do you talk to your uncle much when he's not here for a week? do you ring him on the telephone to tell him how the matches went?
what do you think of your opponent? he played pretty well, didn't he?
are you going to play doubles? have you decided not to play doubles now in this tournament?
but you still hope tomorrow to play singles?
thinking of wimbledon, what's your first memory of when you first went there?
your first memory of going to wimbledon. what do you remember about it?
you have to play lpez next. what are your thoughts on that?
you had the queen's granddaughter, princess beatrice, cheering for you today. and you'll be playing in front of the queen at wimbledon if the schedule goes as planned. how much interest do you have in the british royal family, and does that excite you?
how are you feeling? you seemed to be suffering a bit with your shoulder in the match.
do you know what the reason was for the shoulder? just suddenly came on or what?
you must be pretty pleased with the way you played that first round and getting through seppi, and then to actually come back in this match. i would think you're feeling pretty good on the grass.
what did you do the last two weeks when the french was going on?
did you not think about qualifying, trying to qualify for paris?
you're the next big thing in australian tennis. do you feel some pressure from that?
what will you do now?
has there been any indication of what course of action might be taken as far as the wildcard is concerned?
you sounded a bit disillusioned when you left paris. are you sort of refreshed and have got a different attitude now?
compared with slugging around the clay court circuit, is this sort of a nice difference for you? do you like grass?
you find the traveling difficult?
it's ironic in one sense. he knocks you out in paris and you feel so disillusioned, and then you get a chance to redeem yourself by beating him over here so early in the tournament.
what do you have to adjust to grass? for your game, what do you need to do?
when you reflect on roland garros, was it a case of just playing too much prior to that or...
how big is wimbledon gonna be for you after a first-round loss in melbourne and at roland garros?
how about when you pulled out of doubles at roland garros? how did john take that? was he okay with that?
but didn't you guys say you wanted to, as a goal, qualify for the year-end championships?
you still playing wimbledon?
once you got back to la, what did you do and how long did it take you just to get over the feelings that you had paris?
did any of the players call you, any of the american players?
did andy call you?
articles in the u.s. press talked about american tennis being in decline. can you explain what the feeling is over there and sort of where this talk comes from?
so in terms of the grand slams, do you think it's sort of on you and john to try and make the headway into the grand slams?
looking forward to going to colombia?
so after two years off the grass, what's it like to play it again?
i mean real tennis.
you feel you move well, as well? you move well?
can you compare how you're feeling now compared to 12 months ago obviously when you played at hurlingham and had to go home.
but how difficult was it for you to miss wimbledon, and did you watch any it?
did you watch any of the tournament? did you watch any of the final?
because you have transferred in 2008 from clay to grass and were so successful, mentally is it much easier now to deal with this move?
do you think the hardest transition of all in tennis is from five sets on clay to three sets on grass? because you can have ten minutes of bad tennis and you're out.
how does it feel to be no.1 again?
two of the times you were in london last year with the hurlingham match and then with the o2 arena when your knees were hurting again and you were very --
i said last year was obviously a difficult year, as you said, at roland garros. were those two of the worst sort of moments of that year when you were in london before at hurlingham and at the o2.
do you think you're a better player now than you were wimbledon 2008? and if so, what specifically -- especially on grass.
how many times have you watched the 2008 final?
have you found a solution to the knee problem?
what have you done to help it?
the most important thing?
you're world no.1 again, but wimbledon has this ability to change the seeding 1 and 2 if it looks at the previous record. will you expect to be no.1 seed at wimbledon this year?
won't mean anything to you?
is what happened on sunday still in your mind, or is that now in the past and it's all concentration on grass and what's coming up?
playing on grass, is it easier for your knees or do you worry about twisting on grass?
natural?
last saturday for the first time an italian woman won roland garros. after winning, francesca schiavone told us that she was wondering what you thought about her win, and she was very keen to know your opinion because you are the master of the clay. can you tell us if you met her, what did you say? what's your opinion about her victory?
it was a good win today. are you pleased with the way your form is going immediately on grass?
you play andy murray next. what do you remember from your match with him here last year?
miami was the last time you met, wasn't it? you won that one, so presumably...
he was defending champion there in miami. does that put any added pressure on a player when you're coming back to a tournament that...
how have you progressed do you feel in the last year from the match last year? how would you say you have progressed?
how did you break a rib playing tennis?
it's a few years now since your highest ranking. presumably if you stay injury-free, you're fitter, you can go back up...
do you enjoy playing against guys who have got the home-team support behind them?
how does it feel to have grass back under your feet again?
does the first match get easier year by year?
is that win almost too easy?
when you have long since hung up your racquet and there is the andy roddick tournament in austin, texas, or wherever, would you like to hold it on a grass court? would you like to see grass courts back in the states more?
getting rid of that red stuff?
is that a realistic possibility that that would ever happen?
do you talk to the other guys about it? does it ever come up in conversation?
you see, from our perspective we look at the calendar and we say there are two great big american hardcourt tournaments in the spring. then there's clay. then there's grass.
then there's another big american season in the summer.
something's got to give.
have you seen a way that the fan reaction to you has changed at all this year compared to other years?
today when you were practicing there were more people probably watching you practice than on some of the courts where players were playing.
since you got here, how many times have people mentioned last year's wimbledon semifinal?
sorry, final.
has there been as much reaction -- was there more reaction to last year than, for example, to your first wimbledon final?
i think also, you know, post-final speeches normally don't say very much, but what you said really caught the british public's imagination.
you say you haven't watched it. will you watch the final at some stage in the future?
good start to your grass court season?
when was the last time you had two wins in three hours?
it's unusual, isn't it?
what about the knee? i see you got the ice pack on?
was it good to have kim back on courtside cheering you on today?
the reason you're on doubles, presumably just grass, getting more and more grass under your feet?
how did the regeneration of the partnership with jamie come around? did you suggest that to him or did he suggest that to you?
disappointing, then, first set and then there was the delay a factor?
must have been a bit disappointing, those two double faults on your serve?
were you hoping to prove a point, having had to qualify?
was it a surprise when you discovered last night that you are not going to be given the wildcard at wimbledon?
what do you think about that? is that fair enough or...
have the lta or wimbledon explained that to you, explained why they're not giving it to you?
what's your sort of thinking behind your decision not to play davis cup?
isn't it a good chance to sort of start afresh as the new davis cup captain, wouldn't now be the time to...
what would have to change then for you to say, yeah, i will play?
what do you feel you can achieve in the game? what level do you feel you can still get in the rankings?
how is it that people ranked lower than you get more funding than you?
how much money did you lose? how much funding did you lose?
what do you have this year?
that's a big drop.
are you out of pocket?
are you out of pocket? are you funding it yourself?
why do you think you have not fulfilled your potential so far?
you've played ilhan, i think. did you play him in australia?
it's a sort of dangerous tie, isn't it, would you say?
can i just verify, you said your conversation with leon, you think that led directly to you not getting welcome?
i suppose you're a little disappointed having got that lead in the second set, james, that you didn't go on and get to a third?
can you say what the difference is -- i mean, i've seen you do tremendously well, going around and picking up points going to the plateau almost where you are now, the difference between that and then getting to, say, 120 in the world, what is it in the players? is it consistency?
how can you get more consistent?
do you still feel as if there is that step within...
do you get the sense also that it takes the crowd here a little bit of time to warm to the fact that there is a british player out there?
that crucial moment in the match when you could have done perhaps just a little bit more oomph there, it wasn't really there?
have you spoken much with leon since his appointment?
and getting the sort of the lithuania result -- i know you have your win, but getting that one out of the system, it will be nice to get out there and be on the winning side?
you had those chances in that third set.
you've played him 11 times. did he show you anything different?
how are you feeling now?
was that tiebreak some of the hardest tennis you've played mentally?
the end of the tiebreaker you were touching your left hip. was there a problem there or just tightness?
is there a sense as matches go by that you feel closer to him in these terms? are you getting closer in grand slam terms?
was there one set point in particular you felt you should have taken?
everyone talked about your aggressive approach against nadal, and others as well. how would you compare that match and your approach there with your approach tonight?
what did you learn about dealing with that weight of expectation from the uk?
what does this do to your mindset for the rest of the year and what's to come?
does getting to the second one make you hungrier?
if you have one chance to go back again out there now, what would you do differently?
is there anything in your game that you were particularly disappointed with tonight?
you've fair enough to say you probably played some of your best tennis over the last fortnight. is it dispiriting you've not been able to win a title after playing like that the last couple weeks?
how painful was it to be standing on the stage for two or three minutes when roger was joking with the crowd and making his speech and told you, don't worry, you'll win a grand slam one day?
agassi won his first slam when nobody expected on grass. do you expect you can do it on clay, which is not your favorite surface?
would you say maybe your ability to retrieve is just as important as shot-making, the balls you ran down?
did you think it was a great strategy tonight, more than usual?
we saw you engage in psychological warfare, talking about the pressure on him, how long it's been, using 150,000 years out on court. was it so much sweeter beating andy because he has a very good record against you and has got under your skin in the past?
after the emotions of wins 14 and 15, how do you rate a 16th title?
how do you keep doing it year after year, grand slam after grand slam? you make it look so easy, and obviously it isn't.
would you have been confident even if you lost the third set? how were you feeling at that point?
andy said he can cry like you, but he can't play like you. you were very gracious about what you said about him afterwards. what makes you think he will win one of the trophies?
this is your first australian open for a couple of years. can we now start talking about a grand slam? is that on your mind with nadal having some issues and you looking very good?
do you let yourself sort of think about what sort of legacy you'd like to leave on the game when it is done?
the way you feel and the way you're playing, is there any suggestion that you couldn't go on for another four, five years? doesn't seem to take that much out of you. you have a new physio working with you.
you mentioned a couple times it's your first major win as a dad. did you ever doubt you'd be able to keep winning as a father?
how will you celebrate tonight? any different?
can you understand why andy got emotional at the end? you've been through that yourself. you say it's hard to win the first one. can you appreciate why he felt as deflated as he did at the end?
were you fully fit tonight? you grabbed at your stomach a couple of times. did your stomach give you problems?
were you tired because of the previous two five-setters you've had?
federer was pretty awesome out there tonight, wasn't he?
what did you think of his game?
what did you learn from the game? did you learn anything from it that you've got to do in the future?
were you surprised by how good he was tonight?
why?
do you think you can play better against him next time?
how?
what was wrong with your game tonight?
were you mentally exhausted, as well?
if roger plays like that, do you think anyone can beat him?
what were your tactics before the game to try to counteract roger?
what do you think andy murray could do to stop roger federer on sunday?
do you have any advice for him?
how do you rank yourself now? you were a finalist two years ago. are you a better player now?
so you're reasonably happy with this tournament, the way it went?
the australian open is your best grand slam. why do you like playing here?
that was a pretty relaxed and amusing interview you gave jim courier. is this as relaxed as you've been going into a grand slam final?
are there days - maybe this was one of them - that you can feel it in your bones you're going to be roger federer plus?
it's actually only 74 years since we haven't won a grand slam.
you said 150,000.
can you imagine what it is like for a nation to have wait for so long to win a grand slam?
feels like it.
normally the guy who plays you has nothing to lose at all. andy is in a slightly different predicament. do you think that will affect his game at all?
do you still feel a need?
given the fact that andy has had another 24 hours to prepare and rest, how important was it for you tonight to be off the court early, 90 minutes, done, finished?
some of your shots you seemed to change mid-stroke.
you were going to play a dropshot and you played a longer one.
how much is instinctive and how much is thinking during the rally and during the shot?
on nights like tonight, does it ever bother you at all that it might be a boring match to watch?
you were not expecting anybody from the corner of muhammad ali to throw the towel in the middle of the match?
he got you to run around a lot early on in the game. you matched every challenge there. besides hitting a thousand tennis balls in practice, what do you do to keep yourself so aerobically fit?
what has been the maximum number of hours in a gym in one day in your life?
you've won finals against andy, but he's got the better record. why do you think that is?
has he improved since the us open final from what you've seen?
the last two matches where you did beat him and stop the four-match losing streak, were there any things in murray's game that you found that you could exploit more now?
when is the last bad match you played?
how do you feel after that?
the emotional lift you got and the whole crowd got from that one shot, how important was that in your own mind?
you said you often practice that shot. how often do you hit it as well as that?
you talked about the nerves. in the first hour, i think everyone in the stadium could sense it was nerves. is that the semifinal-itis?
how concerned were you early in the second set?
what is the opportunity to play another grand slam final mean to you at this point in your career?
how do you deal with the expectation building back home?
can you give us your thoughts on your prospective opponents?
the tv coverage highlighted you kind of clenching at your back. any concern there?
the buildup to this final is very different to 2008. you basically were there before you knew it because of the scheduling. is this going to give you different problems? you have a lot of time to kill.
from the experience of roddick, did you learn things from that that you could apply today?
i think there's a general perception that you were extremely nervous in your first slam final. can you describe your feelings that day?
you only lost one set so far. could you be feeling better going into the final?
is there any extra motivation for you to know that you could be the one to break a long grand slam drought for britain?
and what would it mean for scotland to you?
so much time between now and the final, is there a danger you might play the match too many times in your mind?
when you bring off the kind of shot you did bring off in the second set, then in the final game of the match, the crowd really is loving it, how do you feel out there?
you told us yesterday you like to enjoy any match you're playing no matter what the stakes are. do you think you'll be able to enjoy the final, considering how important it is?
do you have a preference?
is there a danger you could end up playing the occasion rather than the opponent?
you played in some amazing stadiums. where does rod laver arena rank against the others?
novak talked about his problems. he had some problems during the match. when did you first notice that he was having problems?
how were you feeling at the end of the third set when you were two sets to one down?
i mean were you feeling worried when you were two sets to one down?
what do you have to do to beat roger? you've beaten him before. do you take confidence from that?
is it good to know you have beaten him before? does that give you confidence?
roger said in the press conference before your match against djokovic that djokovic had the edge and experience over you and that might help him tonight. how much is that gonna be a factor against federer? he's got so much experience at this stage of a tournament in five-set matches compared to you.
so you think yourself that mentally and so on that you'll handle the occasion well?
how do you think you are a different player from 2008 when you reached the final?
why do you think you've done so well here at this tournament over the past three years compared to other places?
the crowd support you have here, you seem to be very popular here. is that something you can feed on in the next match too, do you think?
after the hewitt match, you described yourself as a great frontrunner and the importance of winning first sets. how deep did you have to dig today to get out of it?
what was happening with the sun?
serving for the match in the fourth and davydenko fires those two rocket returns; what were your thoughts when they came back and he broke you?
23 straight grand slam semifinals. where does that rank in your accomplishments, and can you believe it?
so many incredible records. this one today is one that maybe nobody will ever remember. you won 6-love in the third set hitting only two winners. how does it come? how do you explain it?
when you were on the run today, so you feel that was that some of your best tennis?
do you feel you can get better still? does that drive you to make your game better still?
do you feel like you can still get better, though?
yeah. just be clear.
can you talk about how your game matches up against tsonga and djokovic?
are you the sort of character that seeks revenge given that novak beat you last time here?
now that the defending champion is out, are you feeling a little bit less pressure?
there are many players that don't read much and don't know much about tennis. you come here and you say that you know tsonga played for the first time five sets and you know that tsonga beat four times out of six djokovic and things like that. that means you read a lot? you like to keep yourself informed on what happens during a tournament? you read papers?
as a fan, who is your idol apart from roger federer?
what was the problem with your health?
was it something you ate?
did you have any memories of last year here when you had to withdraw from the match?
when did you start feeling ill?
are you injured in your legs or something like that?
how did you think he'll go against roger federer?
you still were playing some great points in the fourth and fifth sets, some great rallies. what would you put your level at in that fourth and fifth set?
did you think to give up?
you will be no.2 if murray doesn't win the tournament. is it important for you?
down two sets, was it a matter of playing catch-up tennis that proved too much for you?
what was the story in the fifth? talk about the shoulder or arm or whatever was bothering you.
you fought hard and clawed your way back into it. you had love-40 in the first game of the fifth. did that kind of suck the wind out of you a little bit?
ever played in a match with so many twists and turns?
were you forced to flatten the ball out more off the ground on the forehand? was it hurting your hand hitting topspin?
did you feel after the second set you might not play the third?
what are your impressions of him as a young player coming through?
disappointment or do you just say to yourself you hurt the arm, just leave this one behind?
did they explain to you in medical terms what it is? is it a muscle? tendon?
no.
you'll get further attention?
further examination.
cilic has played two five-setters in a row, three in the tournament. how much of a factor do you think that will be for him in the next round, two five-setters?
in terms of the young players you've seen coming through this game, his ability to get through the fifth sets, be unflappable, resilient, where would you put him in the group of young players you've seen in the game?
could you let us know what the condition is, what the latest story is with the knee. it's very unusual for you to stop during a match.
was that the most aggressive he's played against you?
is it the same sort of injury?
does it feel worse or the same?
does it feel as bad as it did last year?
it happened the end of the second set?
you were talking about your level of play today. when do you think you last played as confidently and as well as you were doing for the first two sets?
here last year?
are there any changes you're going to make to your training style or your playing style?
how confident can you be that your knee problems are going to suddenly stop?
you know what it takes to win this tournament. you won it last year. what will it take for andy to win it?
are you worried how long your knee might keep you out?
you don't think it will keep you out for a long time?
apart from the serve, what was andy doing particularly well tonight that perhaps you hadn't seen before in past matches?
your first grand slam semifinal. how did you get there? what was the key to the game?
andy said as a 21-year-old he was impressed with your composure. is that something you've worked on or are you naturally relaxed?
does that composure help you through?
do you think it will also help when you come up to a semifinal?
what were your thoughts when you could see andy was suffering a little bit? what was going through your mind?
in the first game of the first set, most of us would have said, it's the end of the world. what do you do?
were you surprised you got out of it?
do you allow yourself to think about winning the tournament yet?
why are you playing such good tennis?
why are you a good player?
have you been doing any extra work over the break leading into this year or...
you say you know how to learn. is bob brett a good teacher?
do you have the game to take it to murray or nadal?
two sets to love down. how hard is it to come back from that situation?
did you think you had the game of the match when you were two sets all?
are you playing as well as this time last year when you had the five setter with nadal?
do you think he's looming as a potential champion? is he playing good enough tennis?
what do you need to do to get to that level of rafa and roger?
how did you enjoy your first five-set match?
you won the first two sets. what happened after that? did he play better?
what was going through your mind when you started the fifth set? did you feel good?
djokovic is next.
what is your game plan against him?
what do you feel you've learned since the 2008 final against djokovic?
you don't have any fears going into this match?
how disappointing was that?
do you get the feeling that he seems to lift his play against you?
what do you think you have to do against roger when he plays like that?
is it a case that you still feel you're driven to bridge the gap with him? is that what drives you now still?
did you feel like you had your a game?
when you reflect back on this tournament, what will you think about?
the way you played the last few weeks, where does that put your mindset for the rest of the year?
you had some different strapping on your knee. how is the body holding up generally after the first grand slam of the year?
everything else okay?
does playing lleyton bring out the best in you?
how did you rate the match tonight?
how important was it for you to take the crowd out of the equation and get a good start early?
when you talk about being a frontrunner, when you have the first set under your belt, does your mindset change at all?
where do you rate your rivalry with lleyton?
you said tonight you thought nikolay had improved his serve and that's what makes him more dangerous. how has he done that, and what makes him more dangerous on serve now?
you've got the grand slam record, family, and heaps of money. what motivates you now?
you mentioned tonight you played some amazing shots. how often are you genuinely surprised by some of the shots you come up with?
lleyton was saying you're still pretty much the best in the game. what makes you so good, do you think?
we try to answer it all the time.
do you think the way you played tonight is the form that helped you get your last grand slam? is it good enough?
are you getting enough sleep with the twins?
a lot of players are intimidated when they go on the court against you. can you tell us the last time you were intimidated going on to the court and how you get through that.
in the tiebreaker, were you trying to give your fans a heart attack or what?
fernando thought you looked very tired at the beginning of the fifth set. were you confident going into the fifth set?
he has a reputation of being one of the strongest and fittest players on tour. how much inspiration can you draw from winning in the fifth set?
will you watch tonight's game, the prospect of playing...
would you like to play at night, the night session?
if you play against federer, who will be the favorite of the match?
why?
did you change something in your way to play against him last two games, last two matches?
it's probably better that you play him in night because you beat him in doha. you beat him indoors at night. is it easier to read the balls at night maybe?
and can you read the balls better at night with the eyesight or is it easier during the day?
in your head is federer still the favorite?
for years you've said you don't want to be a star and you don't mind playing on the back courts. but you seem to have quite a profile here. has this been fun? what's it been like?
has this been a fun week for you being in the public eye a little bit more than usual?
jim courier is interviewing you on the court. that didn't happen in years past. this room is full.
we're interested in you, but do you believe this is your grand slam? do you believe this is the one for you?
have you allowed yourself to dream that it might be this time?
seems that prince has found your phone number again. they offered a contract with the racquets again.
you said last year all the money was for sharapova.
what will you get up to tomorrow? what's your normal day off?
well done. you survived a couple of breaks in the third and fourth. what happened in the last? how hard was the last set?
do you think he has the game to be able to go on and maybe take the title this year?
what about for you? the game was so long. how are you feeling now and is there a bit more belief for you?
all about the fight, not necessarily about the form.
did you get more aggressive from the ground in the fourth set?
did you feel down and out in the second and third set when things were going against you and he was making all those winners?
all the previous victories you had over him matter at the end of the fourth set because it seemed like he was getting close, but you sort of knew inside you could out-tough him a little bit.
did you feel that broke him a little bit, to have 40-love game and lose the set?
so you expected the point to be replayed?
he seemed to self-destruct after that. do you think he deserved a replay? he was saying he could have had a swing at that.
two guys 9-0 clashing in the next round. talk about that matchup.
you haven't played him for a couple years.
did you twist your knee or ankle in the second set?
there were some comments on tv, guys didn't feel like you were hitting out enough on the forehands. was that mostly conditions? do you feel you should be giving it a ride a little bit more?
a bit too chilly for your liking?
what did you think of the fans tonight? he had a lot of support.
are you playing as well as you would like to at this stage, with a view to playing the final? is your form to your liking?
how difficult is it to imagine where the serve is coming? you study the serve of an opponent before or you guess.
you always play every point very strong. against that kind of player, is it more important, every point is more important, than any other player?
how were you feeling at the start of the third set?
andy was pretty impressive tonight. do you feel like this is a really big test for him, where he can play you when it really matters instead of in smaller tournaments? is this a big moment whether he can stand up or not?
yes.
is it a more difficult test for you than you would like at this stage of the tournament?
what do you think of your record against top-10 players over the last eight months?
you tell us.
is it an issue with confidence at all?
which would you prefer, for you to win the australian open or for spain to win the world cup?
you spoke about your knees giving you trouble. how are you physically? are you fine for right now at this stage?
you talked about murray being a very difficult opponent. what is the hardest part about playing andy murray?
you served 28 aces today, but it wasn't enough. how important is that to you, that part of your game?
is there another part of your game you need to work on especially?
can you give us an idea of where nadal's game is at the moment?
can you offer a view of him playing against murray, how that matchup might be?
what is it about murray that makes him difficult?
is that something you have to be wary of, change your game? do you have just one speed?
yes.
do you think you came in enough?
you had a set point in the first set. didn't convert. do you feel if one or two of those had gone your way, maybe it would be a different match?
how did you feel physically out there?
looking forward, what do you take out of time over here?
what about wimbledon? will the grass suit you?
your results are improving. you're playing the elite players more frequently. what do you feel like is still missing in your game to get to that level?
do you have davis cup ambitions?
you're probably playing your best ever tennis. that makes andy's result even better that he managed to beat you in straight sets. do you think you lost to the finalist or this year's champion?
when we first ran into you, you were just out of college. you didn't really know where you fit in tennis, i guess. what's the difference now between that young john isner and the professional tennis player now?
you had steve smith back today watching you and also you had t.o. is that part of the same group?
it was a hard way to make your first australian open quarterfinal. tell us how did you do it in the end.
did losing last year's u.s. quarterfinal to him have any influence in the way you approached today's game?
did seeing him win the open provide you with any extra motivation or self-belief because you are so close in age?
how much has your game changed since you started working with bob brett? what kind of changes has he made to your game?
compared to the win over the murray in new york, how is...
to win it in five sets, more of a struggle versus new york, is that more satisfying?
can you talk about either roddick or gonzlez as your next opponent?
do you feel ready to win three more matches?
do you feel nothing to lose before the match?
what's the problem?
wrist pain?
which wrist?
did you have any treatment?
do you know what it is? is it tendinitis?
you didn't practice yesterday at all?
you felt it today in the warmup?
did you actually get to the court today?
have you had this before?
how disappointing is it after winning that long match now having to pull out?
do you have any idea how long? did the doctor say?
is it disappointing that you didn't get more match time, that the match finished early? would you have liked to have a little bit more?
will you have to change your preparation for the next match in any way?
when did you notice that he was in trouble? did you know at all?
you must feel pretty pleased, it seemed, to be at the end of the match, even though you seemed a bit up and down. you got through it pretty well.
do you feel as if this is a tournament in which you can go all the way or at least be very dangerous?
against tommy haas, what do you think made the difference in the end?
how happy have you been with your game throughout the first week?
so you've got room for improvement then? it can only go up.
what about your memories of two years ago here and the great run you had? does that help a bit when you come back here?
what do you need to do to play your best tennis in the second week? you said you haven't played your best tennis.
some players get intimidated when they walk on to center court and there's 15,000 people there. you seem to really enjoy being out there in front of the crowd and putting on a show for the crowd.
what about your next opponent, almagro. tell us how you need to play against him.
when were you aware that marcos was in trouble?
is this the ideal lead-up for a match against roger federer?
what do you do in your preparation now to compensate for the fact that you didn't have a big workout tonight?
so you would rather have a shorter match than a longer match leading up to playing someone like roger?
is there a slightly different letdown process that you've built yourself up to a game and obviously it didn't go the way you expected it to?
could you hope to be in better form coming into a match against roger?
fitness-wise, is this the best you've been going into an open campaign for while?
you lost the last 14 matches against roger federer. how can you beat him monday? what will be the key?
do you feel very different coming into this match than you did in new york in september?
are you expecting to play monday night if you get a choice?
when does that start to happen, the thinking about roger?
so you just enjoy tonight?
you have run into roger more often i think than any of the other active players on the tour at the moment. do you view this as one of your greater opportunity to get one back, given his record at the masters and doha, that he hasn't been in as good a form?
obviously you wouldn't be playing if you didn't believe you could beat roger. what is it that makes you continue believing you will eventually get over on him one day?
having played him 20 or 21 times, is this the greatest rivalry you've had, maybe the most special rivalry you've had your career?
sharing the billing on monday with sam stosur. good to see sam get through?
seems to have been kind of an injury-prone day for some of the other players. marcos was one of three people that retired in matches. it's not hot out today. are there some other conditions that you think might be contributing to it, or it's just the first big tournament of the season?
could you assess your game today? tell us what you thought of it.
i think you made 39 unforced errors. i know you've got high standards. is that a little bit disappointing?
are you happy with the way the tournament's going now?
do you sense that there is an even greater strength in depth at the top of the game? coming into this event, you could have made a case for probably 12 players having a great shot at winning this.
does that drive you, the fact that the youngsters on the block are nipping at your heels nowadays?
how do you feel in comparison to the last time you won a grand slam as far as form?
we saw nadal fighting pretty hard last night and getting through. everyone talks about his mental strength. do you think you get enough credit for your mental strength and toughness?
it's the first time we've had the top three players on the council. you've been in that role for a while now. do you feel like you guys are having any affect on the way the tour's run?
what do you think are the top pressing issues?
yeah, for the tour.
to follow up with that question, they're talking about a world cup competition which could be replacing the davis cup over two years. what do you think about that? we read some strange stories, like the players can be substituted during the match. so if it comes out from you straight as you said it, or you read it from the press, did you read anything about it?
you spoke on court after the match about the fact that your father worked here for a few months, and there was a chance for a while that the family could have emigrated to australia. could you elaborate on that?
what was your father doing out here? and secondly, australia day is coming up, and traditionally any new citizens who want to change nationalities choose that day to do it. you've still got time.
was that the best performance you've put up in the tournament so far?
it seems it's gonna be a replay of the belgrade final against kubot.
you chose not to play in a ranking tournament before coming in here. what was the thinking behind that?
do you feel fresh now?
the top players say you like to work into a tournament. how much of a game like that today will actually help you?
you seem to have a slightly perhaps lower profile here this year than last year. are you enjoying that more than usual?
has the locker room respect for davydenko grown over the past couple months?
are you kind of just quitely excited about looking forward to next week? would that be a proper descriptor?
in the 12 straight wins you conceded fewer games in a grand slam in this tournament. can you keep up this excellent form? do you think about it?
why are you playing better tennis this year than last year or the year before?
this year, everyone thinks you can win a grand slam. did you think that about yourself last year or is it different this year?
but in the slams before, wimbledon, us open.
are you a superstitious man? are you repeating what you do before every match that you've been on this run since london? do you have superstitions?
so much of the emphasis on tennis these days in the men's game is about players who are 6'7", 6'9". we have karlovic, isner, del potro. huge men. here you are.
relatively.
there are different ways of succeed in tennis.
trying.
a lot of stories in the papers are about how the male tennis player is getting bigger and bigger. when you walk past isner you must think he's a giant.
maybe you scare them more than they scare you.
are you still one of the least-known players? do you get bothered for your autograph? you said no one in london did at all. are you becoming a little bit more...
you live your life.
if you make the final, would you like to play on margaret court arena? you've spent a lot of time out there. are you disappointed that you haven't played on center court yet?
if you win a grand slam, what do you think will happen in russia?
do you think the people of russia will celebrate?
do you think you'll get a call from marat safin if you win?
you don't think he will call you if you win a grand slam?
if you're in russia, do people recognize you in the streets? do they know you?
when the girls won grand slam and myskina won the french open, putin rung her up. do you expect a call from medvedev?
what did he do? tell us what he did.
is the tournament really beginning now?
is it getting tough, the real tournament is starting now?
if you had to marry another russian tennis player, who would it be?
get married, like husband and wife.
sorry about that. (laughter.)
what was the nature of the injury?
so you were aware of it yesterday but thought you could get over it?
how did you feel during the warm-up?
you didn't get it playing beach cricket, did you?
was there a point in the match where you particularly...
what did lleyton say to you after the match?
what did you make of the way lleyton was playing? a noticeable improvement from the last match?
how do you rate his chances against roger?
you've played a lot of excruciating matches, but where would this one rate?
no, not at all. things couldn't have gone very wrong.
you had 21 unforced errors in the whole match. he said that was the thing that made the difference for him. you just didn't miss from the baseline. do you have the same feeling?
he said that.
anything about your game that you liked?
beyond just this match, how do you strike the balance between playing with passion but managing emotion?
overall.
are the stakes higher now that you're older than when you were younger because there's a finite window of opportunity to win this second slam?
how long do you think the window is open for that?
have you talked to larry tonight since the match?
was there something going on in the box during the match? i couldn't tell.
that strange shot where you reached over the net. seems like you forget the rules for a second or were going to get into a jawing match with the umpire.
talk about gonzo. good record against him. talk about that matchup.
in the fifth game of the second set, you finished, get a second ball ace on the sideline. kind of daring at that stage. then you finally broke him to get ahead. do you think that was a critical point?
no. it was 40-30.
tiebreakers are usually your friend. you lost the first one. how much concern was there after the first set?
can i ask you about a german junior named dominik schulz. you've been practicing with him during the off-season.
what is your opinion on him?
is this the most sound you've been in terms of coach and now being married as a package?
you were talking a moment ago about controlling the match on your serve. is that related to first-serve percentage?
how have you pulled up after that long match?
anything in particular you think you need to work on?
he seemed to attack your serve, especially your second serve. are you worried about that?
how was your confidence tonight?
does that match help you going into the rest of the tournament, that you improved?
what about your next opponent, karlovic? how do you approach that match?
did the heat affect you at all? do you prefer playing earlier?
do you spend time tomorrow analyzing this match or do you immediately look at the next one? what do you take from it as you move on?
what level do you think you need to get to feel confident? do you need to beat a top-10 player again?
what do you need to accomplish to get your confidence? what kind of level of player do you have to beat before you are fully confident again?
you played some amazing shots tonight. the volley after the pickup, some running passing shots. do you surprise yourself sometimes with your shots?
who chose your orange shirt?
do people like it? have you had good feedback about it?
when you went down with the back problem, has there been a problem, when you twisted the back?
obviously very pleased with your returns.
you've not gone beyond three sets. would you have wanted to be more tested by now?
you've broken your opponent's serve the first game the first three games. is that important? usually is that what you're trying to do?
do you sometimes watch speedway on sky sports every monday night?
you're not into extreme sports, like watching them?
no chance to get an invitation by jenson button?
you said before the tournament you want to at least get to the fourth round. can you start to afford yourself thoughts of a nadal quarterfinal?
where would you rate that one?
big wins.
the last few sets you had the kick serve ace on set point. that was pretty exciting. good play in the breakers.
what sort of match are you expecting in the next round?
when somebody has such a good reputation and stats as a returner, does that affect your attitude?
have you hit with andy at all?
how do you explain the great recent form you've been, auckland to here?
how were you introduced to steve smith?
do you see andy as one of the main threats for the tournament here?
did beating roddick at the us open do a lot for your confidence?
do you have to push yourself in the tiebreaks? i know you can serve big when you want to, but to play aggressive with the forehand, do you have to kind of tell yourself, okay, don't play too conservative with this guy?
how do you think your serve compare's to andy murray's?
you say andy is good at everything. what is the best thing about your game that andy has to look out for?
what is it like playing someone like monfils who chases balls down, pumps the crowd up? is that a bit of a distraction?
great to see you have a straight-sets win. playing someone you don't play that often, he probably surprised you a bit in the first set. what turned it around for you?
when would you prefer to play on saturday?
will you request the early match on saturday night?
is that last one with marcos two years ago still the most memorable of your career?
tomic was pretty critical about the scheduling of his match last night and the fact that it went too late. just wondering, as someone who has finished a match after 4:00 a.m. does he have a case?
should he expect any sort of leniency? he said because he was young, it was hard for him that late. is that just part of the learning experience?
would you be surprised that a 17 year old would be complaining about playing a night match on rod laver?
was today's match ideal for the baghdatis confrontation?
but he ran around a lot.
are you enjoying this growing rivalry with baghdatis?
when you played with marcos the other day, was he any different than the last time you played him?
his match went nearly four hours today. do you see that as a good advantage for you?
how do you feel?
were you surprised that cilic was taken to five sets last night?
do you think he's moving closer to davis cup contention?
did you watch any of marcos' match today?
what are hoping for in terms of fan support against baghdatis?
do you think it'll be quite even out there? i mean, he's got quite a big fan club here.
was it good to beat someone a lot younger than you today and someone that scrambles around and has big tickets around the world?
do you think the powers that be in australia can learn from how the americans treated donald young early in his career giving him so many wild cards, and that possibly put his career back a year or two?
do you feel your game suits marcos'?
what do you do to get psyched up before matches? are you still watching rocky movies, or is there a new form of inspiration?
kim clijsters is called aussie kim since her relationship with you. what do you think about her comeback?
what music do you listen to before a match?
were you warned beforehand that there may have been a royal visitor tonight during the match?
did you expect the reaction that came with the flashes and the cheering and stuff like that?
yeah.
what would be the most intimidating person that's come to watch a match of yours?
was that game perfect for you for the next round?
back to the prince, he visited -- sorry.
he visited new zealand on his way here. what about your memories of playing in new zealand in 2000, and also do you plan to visit again?
will you get a chance to chat more informally to william later, maybe see him later tonight?
what did he say to you?
have you met other members of the royal family before at wimbledon?
yeah. (laughter.)
but chatty-wise?
just a question about rafa. he's had a lot of problems in the last 12 months, although he...
although he's your major rival, is there part of you that wants to see him back to his best?
have you given any thought to how many years you can stay at the top of the game?
do you prefer playing any time of day or not, or doesn't matter to you? supposed to be 36 degrees in the next couple days. or is it all the same? you just go out there and play your best?
do you think you're becoming a more patient player? you seem to be taking a patient approach and waiting for your opponents to make mistakes.
a slow start, and then on paper it looked a relatively easy game. you seemed a bit frustrated.
why did you struggle in the fourth?
what are your expectations for the tournament? would you feel it would be unsuccessful if you achieved anything less than the title? where have you set the bar for yourself coming into the season?
when did you work on in the off-season to help improve your game from last season?
are you playing well enough to win the tournament?
there's been a lot made of the 2:00 a.m. finish this morning of cilic and tomic. what are your feelings on the late games and late finishes?
how hard do you think it is for a 17 year old to deal with that way past his bedtime? what's your advice to him?
you and roger and rafa have been at council now for a while. describe how that's working with the three of you. do you feel like you have been able to see at the same level on the issues? you talked about the world cup. what other things are important to you guys as far as the tour is concerned?
to shorten the season, is that a high priority still?
a lot better players like yourself have a particular trademark shot or style: federer, movement, say, forehand; roddick, serve.
are you searching for a style still?
you won the singles title last year in belgrade. are you happy or satisfied overall with the attendances in serbia?
what will you be doing for the next two days? we don't have the heat wave that we normally do in melbourne. do you spend more time on the practice court, or stick to the same routine?
perfect start of the tournament.
did your opponent look scared?
something more personal. looking at your bio, i see you changed nationality when you were 18. before you were ukrainian. can you explain a little bit why that happened.
would you love to write a book? because you're an interesting figure, a great character.
whatever.
why are you always talking about money every time?
are you a vodka drinker?
is that where you get your strength from?
if you retire and you explain to your children why you're not working anymore...
if you explain that you don't have a grand slam victory in a tournament, would you be happy?
would you want to have them so they can still see you play?
she thinks you can win the tournament, your wife?
and what do you think? you are the favorite or one of the favorites of the tournament.
your victory against federer in london has changed something for you? more confidence since this victory?
you said your wife says she thinks you can win every tournament you enter.
after, does she analyze your tournament?
so she's a good coach?
how do you feel about a possible matchup with verdasco in the quarters?
it was quite a celebration at the end. you're a happy lad.
talk us through it. what was going through your mind?
what was the emotion and the celebration?
do you think the crowd helped you turn around and fight back?
how do you feel about your first serves? can you be better?
can you tell us what they say when they sing in the crowd?
was it like 2006 all over again here?
are you the fittest you've been?
the cramping at the end, did you have any concerns with the new rule with cramping that you may have to pull out?
you might play lleyton again. how do you feel about that?
the last match that you played against him here, how does that sit in your mind?
big game today. what physically do you need to do to get your body right now?
getting back to the fitness level, have you been doing anything extra?
you said he got tired in the third set. did that surprise you given that he's regarded as one of the fittest players?
you talked about the night match you played. there's been a bit of talk about the night match last night, tomic and cilic, a 17 year old. he said early this morning that he felt it was wrong to have him scheduled at that time. what are your thoughts on that?
do you have a preference, day or night saturday for you?
10:00 at night start?
why do you think it is that you seem to be especially energized by this part of the year? i know it's the start of the new year, but you more than anyone seem to find something special at this time of the year.
how are you feeling after that?
when you say you can't play after 1:00 or 2:00.
do you think you learned anything tonight about your game, what stage you're at in your career?
the level of your popularity is putting you on prime time and the television viewers...
what do you take out of this match?
did that line call overrule rattle you at all? you lost your next service game.
do you feel you might be ahead of schedule given your results of the last week and a half?
you talked about trying to get into the top 100 this year, competing with the men, making the transition.
do you think you might have made a statement for the davis cup selection?
what next? where do you go?
what is your schedule? will you continue to play the challenger in victoria?
what did you talk with marin about after the match?
such an unusual style. to what extent do you think that style is a result of your dad not being classically changed as a coach?
your first five-setter. was the experience what you expected it to be?
do you have a goal for the year now revised because of the last week and a half?
the five-setter you had in the wild card playoff, do you think that paid any benefits tonight? did you learn anything from that experience?
i didn't see the end of your match, but did you have some sort of problem?
did you argue that you could have had a swing at that ball?
you don't think it was a bad call after having watched it?
what about the tennis? how you doing?
on a general subject about umpires and calls, do you think hawk-eye has helped umpires or hindered them? do they go more into their shell?
in that respect, have umpires been rather neutered by being themselves?
at 5-4, two sets to love, match point, a match you've had under an enormous amount of control, is it worth the fight?
is there any element of you enjoying the dialogue with the umpire? you seem to be a little chattier than other players.
it's very entertaining. people enjoy it.
are you prepared to do it to the point of humiliating a linesman?
you said you're not going to play davis cup after a decade. will you miss it?
do you have a view whether the cup should be played less recently?
do you have a preference?
do you feel like you've done your duty, now these last few years of your career you can just be looking after yourself a little bit?
are you happy to see roger on the other side of the draw or...
with the hawk-eye system, do you have faith in it?
apart from the win, what did you like about your game today?
you weren't overextended?
did he surprise you sometimes with some of his shots?
do you think you played better than against luczak the other night?
davydenko told us yesterday he never wants to be really famous like federer or you. how do you feel about being so famous?
after your knee problems last year, how close do you think you are to full fitness now?
last year the first part of your season was exceptional. a lot of people thought you could realize the grand slam. then you had injuries. this year before the tournament, there were many questions about what you can do, having lost against a lot of top-10 players. how do you deal with that? were you sad? do you read about that?
is it difficult for you?
one year ago you were a king, and this year will you win. many questions about you.
you were ranked no.2 for so long, then got no.1. last year you won your grand slam title, losing your no.1 ranking to roger. now you're no.2 again. what is more important, getting the no.1 ranking or winning more grand slam titles?
you're very popular here with the crowds. do you find australian crowds push you and you feel the love from the crowds other than your home?
you seem to take a lot of time signing for fans.
roger had a tough match yesterday against andreev. did that surprise you about how tough that match was? do you prefer to have these tough matches initially so you get challenged and build on that momentum?
could you give us a sense of how tricky it was out there this evening; the wind, the conditions.
was it a routine second-round match? how would you describe your performance?
how well do you think you're serving at the moment? took you to deuce a couple of times.
when you needed to get your first serves in, you seemed to make them today.
dropshots in those conditions, a tough shot to play. but in the wind... you did it very well tonight.
your next opponent, florent serra. you haven't played him much. know much about him?
i assume you didn't know a thing about that guy.
what went well for you in the match?
do you feel you're riding a confidence wave right now?
will you do just a light hit tomorrow?
who are you playing with?
i think, if i'm not wrong, you have monfils next?
you played him?
just talk about that matchup, things that he does, what challenges that presents for your game.
so this was it?
you competed against many generations in four decades. how do you look back at these matchups against many champions? was it a big adventure for you?
could you talk a little bit about the decision you made to come back here another time after you decided to retire.
of all the players you named, could you single out who was the best in those four decades?
what will you do after you plan on retiring from tennis?
would you like to be a coach?
you said you made the decision to come here on the 6th of january.
wasn't the entry deadline to sign up for the tournament a lot earlier?
because you retired, they didn't put you off the list?
fair bit to be happy with that one.
conditions a little tricky out there?
for the night session, you happy to play earlier?
you seemed to hit the ball really cleanly in perth and tonight. can you compare it with any other point that you've hit the ball this well consistently?
you feel like you're hitting it as well as you ever have?
you said after the match you always aspired to win this tournament. does it still have a real burn for you after getting so close a few years ago?
obviously always had a fair bit of expectation on you, too. are you ready for that to start growing?
do you like it?
being ranked 22 at the moment and playing the way you are, you have a look at those guys underneath you working down to no.1. do you see some names there that you think, well, you know, we can knock over a few of those and see where you're gonna end up in the not too distant future?
is that the next aim, to get back inside that top 16, that next level?
can you talk a little bit about how much you have to recover from these games these days in contrast to previous years?
where is the cap this year, the baseball cap? is that something new this year?
but it's been constant for a long time. is it just a constant thing that you've chucked it away this year?
what about the next opponent. i haven't seen the score, but donald young, how do you match up with him and potentially rochus?
just to get your thoughts on the current state of australian tennis at the moment, obviously there's some talent coming through. you've made some comments in the past about the leadership of the game and the direction it's going. do you see any progress or development since you last commented on that?
close call, or based on past experience, you figured you would get to him eventually?
are you very happy to play the best of five?
after such a tough first three sets, how do you explain 6-love in the fourth?
would you say that you saved more the set points or that he missed a little bit of those set points he had?
what's your relationship with hawk-eye these days? i know you don't like it, but have you accepted it more?
how are you finding the challenge of being a dad and the world no.1 player?
nikolay davydenko said everyone in the draw is scared of him. are you scared of him?
not scared?
do you fear him?
can you say something about the wind in the stadiums in grand slams? which differences between this year when it's windy on the two different sides of the court?
can you think about last year where you were at coming into the australian open with nadal at the top of his game and this year? how do you feel different about your game and your attitude now as compared to last year at this stage of the australian open?
was the back bothering you during the australian open last year?
most people go to the office; sometimes they wouldn't like to go. does it happen to you, too? or, i mean, does it happen often that you get bored and you said, okay, today i wouldn't like to play or practice? does it happen often or never?
i think the office is the practice court.
you see the benefit but you don't enjoy?
santoro said today he had the most respect for you out of the whole career. do you have any words for him?
how did you feel after? looked pretty comfortable in the end.
the passing shot he made in the 9th or 14th game, you had a smile to yourself. was that a catalyst for, right, i'll get you for that?
he won the point, though.
what do you think the key is gonna be for you to do as well as you want to at this tournament?
mentally do you feel better prepared than you did, say, during the grand slams last year?
you were having great fun two days ago in the hit-for-haiti game. will you keep this kind of rhythm during this tournament?
for the victims?
do you think it's realistic to say that there's maybe six or seven guys that could win this tournament? a lot of grand slams you go in and hear that, but there's usually three or four guys. this time seems like a bunch of guys.
i read some of your comments on the world cup of tennis. clarify your position. you've got a big davis cup match coming up, and i would say that's been important to serbia before.
you are one of the favorites of the tournament. how do you deal with this? this year many players like nadal or murray thought davydenko can win.
your confidence is 200%, 400%?
do you enjoy scaring people?
scaring everybody that you're scaring now.
this is a new feeling then?
do you feel the attitudes of the other players, the top players, have really changed towards you?
your win in the masters, what has it changed for you?
what did you do with all this money? did you buy a house in russia?
did you buy something for your wife?
what did you buy for her?
do you notice anything about yourself, that you're playing better, anything that is better now?
has del potro taught you to play playstation?
who won at playstation?
since you won the masters, are you more recognized in the street? do you sign more autographs?
are you a celebrity in russia?
do you think players like federer and nadal have an advantage here because you have to win three sets? they always do well in grand slams. do you think it can change something?
you say the masters didn't change a lot. except for the money of course, is it going to change something if you win this tournament?
how much time did you spend in maldives?
how deep did you go in diving?
do you talk to your wife a lot about tennis? is she the one you confide in?
are you a u.s. citizen? i know you're an australian citizen.
what do you take out of a match like that, albeit you lost?
what was the difference between winning and losing in a match that tight?
tell me what happened at 6-5 in the third set on your serve. you served, looked like an ace.
where to from now? you've shown you can match it with a guy who is a form player on the tour. what happens now? do you go back to the states and play?
talk about your davis cup prospects. gooch is injured. do you see yourself in contention for the second singles spot, perhaps?
have you played much doubles with any of the other aussies?
how about here?
you've had conversations with todd about coming back. has he said you have a chance for that second slot?
do you feel the australian public are warming to you? do you feel you get wholehearted support here?
what was your schooling in the united states?
have you played tomic?
is syd teaching or what?
whereabouts?
he was in the crowd, your dad.
do you have brothers and sisters?
are they players?
is j.a. your godfather?
yes.
someone told me he was.
is that a continuation of the sydney form?
so there's plenty of improvement?
how are you finding your form compared to this time last year?
a judge about your opponent? it was his first match in a grand slam.
did you find the conditions tough with the wind?
did you prefer to play on margaret court arena or hisense or maybe the center court?
you had a lot of supporters out there today. does it make a difference when you have crowd support?
you had three really good matches against roger. what makes him so hard to put away?
yeah. you know, you've had opportunities and you play well against him, but you just can't seem to beat him.
what did you feel when you were up serving for that third set? did you have a feeling that, wow, i might be able to beat roger federer today?
yesterday your friend miss kirilenko said you had urged her to make a loud noise to enter the year. she said she did that and now it was your turn.
are you playing doubles?
did you have difficulty with the rain delays and maintaining your concentration?
rubbing your eyes a lot during the last set. was it the wind, too? dust out there?
what pleased you most about the match tonight?
were you very conservative tonight, did you think?
had to mix that with the patience of making sure you kept it in play all the time. how did you work those two against each other?
how much did those winds in kooyong and adelaide help you tonight?
there's been some talk that this barney with you and lleyton has been a distraction for you in the preparation. is it a distraction?
have you spoken to anybody from the hewitt camp since you've been over here for the open, and has the air been cleared at all?
would you like to?
how does it feel being in the second round of your second australian open?
last year you were quite tired during the second round.
is that still way past your bedtime?
the fans at the start of the game, they were fantastic for you. are you getting used to that sort of reception on the big arena here?
they were singing you were australia's no.1. is that where you see yourself?
looking at the next match, may be marin cilic. are you confident playing him?
what about if it's santoro?
can we have your thoughts on your first match?
a lot of the players say that about first rounds. sharapova goes out today. what is the key when you're going out there not to get too overhyped?
looks like you were pretty anxious to get back out on the court in brisbane. at what point last fall were you saying, i have to get on the court to play some matches again?
could you make a comment on the de bakker's game and his potential?
did you take a tumble out there?
has that ever happened to you before?
no injury, though? didn't get hurt at all?
you pinched what?
how would you rate your physical shape now compared to the normal start of a year?
as a long-time davis cup player, what is your take on this new world cup idea?
would you see it as a bit of a risk if the davis cup format went away, given that that competition has a long history?
wouldn't it be a bit of a risk to go that way? because if it doesn't succeed, davis cup might lose part of its allure.
who takes care of your dog when you're away?
you tweet about your dog.
thank you.
do you find it a little strange that the australian open would have an official partnership with a betting company, betfair?
you must be very satisfied with that.
you played under the roof at wimbledon with phenomenal noise. was it very different under the roof here?
did the hopman cup experience help you under the dome, as well, mixing it around with the mixed doubles as well?
how much bikram yoga did you during your off-season?
do you have a preference if it's closed or not? how much difference does it make to you whether you're going to play indoors or outdoors here?
can you run us through your next opponents?
having changed your buildup to this open, starting with a new sponsor, does it feel different this year in any particular way?
must have been quite a buzz for you out there tonight?
what was going through your head at 5-3?
despite the loss, a productive month for you.
when you got to that tiebreak in the first, were you kind of thinking, what if?
what about actually playing out there, though? a double-edged sword? you get to play center court, but against one of the best in the world.
you had a bit of aussie support. gooch was in there.
you going to head to south america now.
do you feel as though you've nailed down that second singles spot?
do you think you're playing the best tennis of your career at 30?
you have to sort of revise your season goals after the past month?
did you speak to lleyton before the match?
fifth time you've picked up this particular trophy. how satisfying is it at the end of this week to have come through in the circumstances you have?
at the end of the second set when he came back at you, what were your emotions then? did you feel it was going to be a tough, tight third set?
three games into the final set, did you sense his energy level dropped a little bit, and did you go more on the offensive then?
what do you think of the way you started the match, were playing really fast, not giving him any time, any rhythm? was that part of your plan?
how have you changed or have you changed the way you prepare tactically for the matches and the tournaments since paul joined your team?
rafael nadal was 11 months without winning a title. you had ups and downs last year. many people thought it was an end of the domination of nadal/federer. this year you won all the four slams, you and nadal. is this going on now? do you think the domination, nadal/federer, will go on also next year?
many, many, many journalists.
i want to know if the gap was bigger and smaller, between you two and the others?
some of your battles with rafa were tough. today you performed fantastic, especially the last set. what makes you give us such a good performance and how do you feel winning the championship?
i know money is not important, but you've won 1 million in eight days. got your eye on anything particularly special?
after the magnificent form you showed today, do you have any plans how long you're going to carry on playing or are you just going to do it as long as you can?
a question about the semifinal match with novak. how would you compare this semifinal to the us open semifinal? was novak really playing much better then or did you start playing better in basel and here?
for some people you open a dictionary and your picture would be under the entry for gentleman.
in a certain way, do you think this tournament is also a message sent to people sometimes who question your form, your mental status, et cetera? as far as i'm concerned, you showed some flawless displays, saying 2011, watch it, i might be back?
on that point, how important was this title for you as you look ahead to defending the australian open in a couple of months?
most of us in december have to watch what we eat and drink because or waistlines get bigger. do you have to watch what you do over the christmas period? can you indulge yourself a little bit, get crazy, have a couple nights out?
a technical question.
i would like to know what kind of string tension and weight of the racquet you were using in this tournament? you change given the surface and everything.
give us your thoughts on today's match.
in the final set tiebreak, you were down 3-love. describe what you were feeling and how you came back into the tiebreak.
the particular moment in the third set when you were love-30 down, would you say it was a turning point in the match, more than what happened in the tiebreak? also what was really going through your mind at that moment?
love-30 in the third set, 1-0. he had four straight games in a row.
how do you feel physically and how do you think you'll be for tomorrow's match?
you repeat every day is it is the worst condition for you to play here. you are in the finals. how can you explain that?
in what ways? surface too slow, too quick?
did you have to adapt anything in your game? did you do anything different on this surface under these circumstances, like playing different balls, different tactics?
when you say you were feeling tired in the match, was it mentally or physically tired? what happens then? you lose a bit of concentration or do you feel a little bit slower?
andy said he really enjoys his matches against you. i wondered if you felt the same way.
your thoughts on reaching the final against rafael nadal?
earlier in the week, boris becker said you probably have to play at a higher level to win a masters cup than a grand slam. would you agree with that?
final against rafa. it means career grand slamer versus career grand slamer. i think this is new history. this is a unique matchup. what do you think about it?
what do you expect for tomorrow's match after rafael has been running for almost three and a half hours against andy, and even rafael is saying he's very tired? how do you feel about that?
do you remember the last match you played in london with rafa?
wimbledon, the classic wimbledon match.
things went well for you today. twice in the match, novak was able to get back from love-40 on his serve. does that concern you for tomorrow?
you have to play nadal, that listening to murray, has a great second serve. everybody says nadal has a huge forehand, improved a lot the first serve. but murray said he was in trouble to return his second serve. is that also something that bothers you a bit, something that you noticed, that you suffer in a way or not?
well, you played so many times.
the competition between the top eight players is supposed to be very close. so far in this tournament, only two out of 14 matches went to the third set. do you think it's coincidence that we have so many straight-setters?
do you base your game plan playing against rafa on what you know from being the other end of the court to him? do you study him much when you're not playing? you often make the final, if there's a final, you get knocked out, you don't watch the final. do you do much homework on television or tapes about rafa?
very difficult to face roger when he's in that type of form.
anything at all you could have done to stop him from playing the kind of way he was playing?
do you think this is the best roger's ever played against you?
how did it compare to the us open semifinal against him?
what do you take out of this week as you prepare for the davis cup?
you've played both nadal and federer in this tournament. can you compare the way the two are playing? what do you see in the final?
it looked like you were struggling physically for a while. was that the case tonight?
anything specific tonight?
a question of "what if's." if you had beaten nadal, you were close, would that have given you momentum? would your physical condition have sort of improved because of the mental condition if you'd won that match? did you have enough in the tank to go through?
out of the 12 matches that we have seen, yours was the only one that went to a third set. does it say anything to you? you against the no.1 in the world.
i'm just asking you if you feel confident, because even if you're not in great shape, you were still capable to fight for three sets versus nadal, who won three matches in a row, and you won all the others in two sets.
he's tried it.
thanks.
as much as you love playing in front of crowds, are there some days you wouldn't be under the spotlight in front of 17,000 people?
when you get home, you said you want to get yourself back in good condition, all that. what will you do as soon as you get home? will it be nothing with the racquets for a few days? when will you start training again, start thinking about australia?
you're still an active player. have you ever thought what you will be doing at the end of your career? would you like more to be a tennis coach or a tv commentator and a journalist?
do you see yourself as a proud father of a boy who is a tennis player?
do you feel next season you might sort of copy federer's example and take more breaks during the season?
with the end of the season going on quite long, maybe at the front play less tournaments.
you've trained with somdev devvarman in the off-season. what is your impression of him? are you going to train with him this off-season as well?
are you going to be training with him this off-season as well?
this is more personal. i heard you like south park. do you still like that? i like it.
yeah.
obviously you're into the semifinals. the emotions are very different from last year. three wins rather than three defeats. how do you feel?
obviously the point in the first set where you queried the awarding of the point to berdych. what do you think happen?
the ball came in.
you seemed to be pretty upset at that point. somehow after that you were able to use the aggression and run away with the match from there. how do you manage to do that?
i know people have been asking you about your season all week. but specifically about the us open. you love all the majors that you have won. was the us open so important to you because of the changes you made to win in new york?
after andy's game last night, he said he didn't feel he had a very good chance of beating you. can you understand why he said that?
he doesn't have a good chance.
would you ever say something like that?
one more point to clarify on that controversial point in the first set. when you wanted to speak to the supervisor, what did you say to him and what did he say back to you? can you remember?
to ask about that point again. i think tomas' argument was that you had challenged already, that you had stopped play.
you put your hand up.
is it possible to have an even better season in 2011?
you had a lot of success attacking andy's backhand. was this like a predefined game plan for you?
that looked easy tonight. was it?
obviously roger federer is your next opponent tomorrow night. is it going to come down to energy?
was your eye okay tonight? did you ever find out what the problem was?
you had that great win over roger in new york. you played a couple of times since then and lost. is that going to affect your confidence or game plan?
you said at the start of the week that you were prioritizing the davis cup final, but fully concentrating on this as well. have you actually been more relaxed because you're in a win-win situation and that may have added an extra level to your game?
you came out to the court with a pirate or you were trying to practice with only one eye?
didn't look very happy with some calls overall in the first set, but you were not challenging. why was that?
how much did the hawk-eye calling the challenge, the resulting outburst at 5-6 affect your concentration? was that the reason why you lost the tiebreak?
were you disappointed with your play in the tiebreak in the first set?
you had a very good year this year. you reached your first grand slam final. but still when someone watches you, it seems you still have a lot of room to improve. what are your goals as this season closes for next year? what are you going to work on in the meantime?
what do you want to improve in your game? where do you see the possibilities to improve?
you played france last year in davis cup. you played serbia this year. which team is a better one? you just played in belgrade.
after what you said before about nadal, that ball, can you explain exactly what happened. i had the impression that nadal was saying he could still play the point. that's why he thought he needed to have a replay of the point. you wanted the point. what happened exactly?
how do you reflect on your experiences of this tournament overall?
players gave recently the fair play sportsmanship award to rafael nadal. what is your opinion about it? were you one of those that voted for him or not?
even after today, you still think that way?
one of the highlights of the season was getting to a wimbledon final. what was it like playing rafa again today?
the backhand at 6-5 and also the first game of the second set, you had two breakpoints, do you think those were the two key turning points?
on the set point when you let the ball go, did you know immediately it was a mistake?
since you played with andy murray and federer, could you compare a little bit what the different feeling is to play against these two guys? who do you think may be in better form?
you've done very well this year. career-high ranking. assuming this is your last match, moving on to next year, are you playing any tournaments in the lead-up to the australian? do you feel confident about keeping up this level of form?
you seem to be flying the flag on your own for swedish tennis. what do you think is the problem with swedish tennis?
does that actually put more pressure on you? does that change the way you think at all?
you had a great year, very consistent. what do you think you can still improve? don't answer that you can improve everything because i know.
what do you need more? for instance, today, i think some volleys were at eight, over number 5 or 4 in the world, and you lost your first break because you didn't go to the net on the previous ball.
you were just talking about your start to the year with brisbane. when will you begin training? where will you train? how far in advance will you get to australia?
just in case ferrer beats murray in straight sets tonight, you probably will end up playing nadal on saturday. any thoughts about playing him on this kind of surface?
are you going to sweden for christmas?
(no microphone.)
strange situation to go into a match knowing that you just need to win a set. did that add to the nerves for you at the start?
what are your thoughts on reaching the semifinal now?
a quick thought about meeting maradona. what did it mean for you? what did you say to him?
as you said, it's a very different scenario playing in the group stages. in some ways will it be nice just to get back to the straight knock-out format at the weekend?
you're now back again no.4 in the world after tonight. you could become no.3 if you win the tournament. at the beginning of the year, after having been twice in a row no.4 in the world at the end of the year, were you expecting something more from yourself or...
is no.4 this year more difficult than to be no.4 last year, two years ago? is this no.4 a better player than the one we had last year and two years ago?
you mentioned you'd enjoy playing rafael nadal in the semifinal. what are your thoughts of the other group at the moment as you head to the semi?
i'm intrigued with you saying you don't think you have much chance to beat rafa. you beat him the last time on hard courts. why don't you think you'll have a good chance this time?
so you're not confident?
now you are with alex corretja. do you remember the match in australia with brad gilbert as a trainer? you have done a good evolution, it seems. i think it was 2006.
your first-serve percentage was pretty low. how are you going to try to improve that before saturday?
could you sum up your match, how you felt you played throughout the tournament.
today you got off to a good start. what happened after that?
did you feel like you had a real chance at the start of the match?
yes, to qualify.
having faced andy murray tonight, if he is to face rafael nadal in the semifinal, how do you think he would do against him?
how have you found the whole week here in london?
andy, i suppose the last of the first set was really tough.
the last of the first set. you were very close, had two set points, as well.
it seemed as though your tactics from the outside were a little different to what they were against rafa nadal. do you have any regrets now sitting there?
better to break the racquet than the foot. can you explain why you were angry with the umpire. there was a hawk-eye decision. was there something i didn't understand?
you were discussing something with the umpire during that game. what was that about?
during the game?
actually, during the game you were talking to the umpire.
anything you could have done differently on those set points?
i would like to ask you, what is the different situation of this tournament when all players more or less calculate or have to calculate points and things like that. for instance, tomorrow federer knows that if he wins one set, he's in the semifinal, things like that. does it change things a bit for a player? you never count anything? you're just told what's going on? does it change your mind if you play and you win a set, you know you're qualified. it's a different atmosphere completely or doesn't change absolutely anything?
i guess not the way you expected the match to go after it being 5-all in the first set.
knowing that novak probably had trouble with his eye, was it sort of distracting for you also?
you appeared to be asking the umpire some questions at some point. was that about the kind of technical procedures for these sort of things?
now you have more opportunities to meet roger in the final. what do you think about it?
you're in a very different position this year compared to last year in terms of your form and fitness. when you look back at the year you have, it must seem incredible to have achieved all those things. how do you feel about the year you've had now?
before today berdych said that he doesn't make any calculation when he plays. he just tries to win. he doesn't know if he is up one set or two games or whatever. what about you? this masters is a special tournament. you just said you know to win one set will be enough for you. federer the other day said also said all the things, what is the score, who is going to win. what is your opinion? who is right, federer or berdych?
you don't relax?
you said the umpire asked you to hurry up between points. that's not the first time that has happened.
what do you think of that criticism of you, that you are too slow between points?
maybe you know there is an exhibition of rafael's painting in the victoria and albert museum. what do you think of your masterpieces and his?
after the first match you said that you were very tense. can you take something from your game today to be confident again for the next match?
you were playing very well until 4-all or so. what happened to your eye? did it ever happen before, something like that? did you lose the contact lenses in your eye or you couldn't find it or what?
can you tell us if you lost it inside the eye?
in any case, you still have that match, you can still qualify.
looking ahead to your match with roddick, you must be still quite wary of what he poses even though he lost two matches.
do you feel like you should have been given more time, given the unusual circumstances?
did the bright lights and the flashing from the cameras make the situation worse?
you've had a problem with allergies in the past. might this be connected with that?
can you tell us if you were happy the way you were playing until 4-all? you were playing probably better than him until that moment. also, when did you start to put the contact lenses, when you were three years old or 18 or what?
obviously delighted with your first win in the championship. how does it feel?
in the first set at 4-5, 15-40, what was going on in your head?
your return is a lot more better in the second set. is there any reason for that?
london is one of the tennis capitals of the world. i don't know if it's a coincidence, but many of the players you have done well with this year, but also in general, they are here. what to you prefer, covered court, open air, clay?
on the atmosphere here, this is your first taste of it, second match, but to find a full-house crowd on an afternoon, it's quite extraordinary, isn't it? what is it like for you to play out there in those kind of circumstances?
soderling last night said that the court is becoming faster. he thought it was slower the first day, and the more you play, it seems faster to him. do you agree or you don't?
rafael nadal will be your next opponent. a rematch of the wimbledon final. a player you have quite of history with. what sort of match do you expect with him? is it more of a motivation than ever to play the world no.1?
it seemed to me there was a guy with a plastic mask sitting on your bench, is that right? could that be?
did you have someone with plastic on his nose sitting on your bench.
i want to come back to bercy. if i am not wrong, you scored only four points in the last set against davydenko. i supposed it was a very low part of your season. what a difference today. how can you bounce back from that defeat today?
how would you describe the second half of your season overall? today would you say this is one of the best matches you've played since wimbledon?
these special tournaments where you can lose one match and win the tournament, what would be your reaction, tomorrow, if federer wins a set, he will be first in his group, if he makes five games he knows he will qualify. does that change something, in your opinion, when you have to play in that sort of situation, whether you are the opponent or federer himself? would it change it for you? does it make a difference?
how comfortable were you today in comparison to the match you played against murray on sunday?
how good are you in maths, mathematics? do you know how many games you have to do?
but do you know what can happen when you play federer, that if he makes more than five games, there's any way to qualify?
how did it affect you today knowing you had to win that match to stay in contention?
you were here last year. the court, is it completely equal or do you find differences? is it slower? do you have to adapt to any kind of thing?
what is your game plan against roger?
let's say that you have the chance to pick up the court where to play against federer. which surface would you choose? what about this one?
can you explain that one away?
you also hit a lot of unforced errors today. were you feeling nervous, tight?
when you were talking about your year in general last week, you repeatedly used the word 'inconsistent.' i guess coming off a really good performance against soderling, this is a perfect case in point, isn't it?
you just seemed very flat out there from the outset. your body language, everything, just gave the impression you weren't mentally quite tuned in.
what are your thoughts going into the final match with david ferrer?
how hard is it? you said you made a bad start to both sets. how hard is it for a player to sort of prepare yourself mentally going into a match to make sure that you get off to the kind of start that you did so impressively against soderling?
are you a little annoyed that you didn't at least take that to a third set?
even though you lost, you still have a chance to get through.
you have a good record against andy in the past.
how difficult was it to face the soderling of today? you created very few breakpoints.
you can still technically make it through to the knock-out. how confident are you of doing that and what do you need to do against murray on thursday?
what would you change in this match today against soderling? backhand passing wasn't working as they can do for you.
did you see andy's game today?
roger, probably most of us were expecting a tight, tough, three-set match. i'm sure you were thinking that as well. circumstances take you somewhat by surprise today?
also not dropping a set today.
roger, andy murray in his interview mentioned his inability to really nail the serve and return was the reason for the way the match went today. is that your reading, too?
andy has won eight of the 14 matches he's played against you, but you've won four of the five either in grand slams or at the end-of-year championships. what do you read into that?
how long does it take you, when a guy comes out and misses nine of his first 10 serves, do you pick up on that immediately? does that help set the tone for you?
maradona has been here the last couple days watching. he was watching your match today. did you meet up with him later on? if so, how did that go?
you've had lots of spells in your career when you've had a coach and spells where you've been on your own. how difficult is it when you have nobody to sort of bounce things off with after the game?
after two straight-set victories, what are your thoughts going into the final match with robin soderling?
how much do you think experience counts in this competition, the round-robin? most of us are trying to work out who is going to go through, the arithmetic. is it going out there playing, knowing exactly what you need to do, is that an essential part of this competition?
good match. you were close. what would you change that that match could go your way toward the end?
are you seeing new dimensions to his game or is this a good tennis player the same way he was in 2008 or whatever?
so if you weren't obligated to be on the other side of the net, fair to say he's your kind of an athlete, your kind of guy?
in the first set it seemed like you were faster on the court than at the end. were you tired or...
you play berdych next. are you happy with your form going into that?
how much did rafa's serve tonight have to do with the score? was he serving worse in the first set than the second and third?
you made 17 aces. do you think the court is slow, like roger federer said, slower than paris bercy?
it's very slow. but in any case you made 17 aces.
what was the turning point in the match? at which point in the match did you feel like the match was slipping off your hands?
your first match at the o2. what do you think of the atmosphere and the crowd?
do you find it distracting, this kind of atmosphere, this kind of court?
so the music and the sound effects doesn't bother you?
novak, tomas said he was very nervous at the start. is that something you thought about before the match and that you would make a strong start against him?
you say it's such a big stage. where are the great imitations gone? this is the perfect stage for the imitations, like in australia? so...
because there was a guy who could learn something from you, maradona, because he made the point in the hand, in football is forbidden, but at the same time you gave back a point in today's match to your opponent.
is he just here on holiday, just watching?
do you think we should be surprised that you and andy and roger have had such emphatic starts here or not?
how easy is it to concentrate on this week when you have the davis cup coming up?
today the french team is starting to prepare for the finals. do you know where are troicki and tipsarevic are? are they preparing for the finals?
you keep in touch?
with maradona, did you speak more about tennis or football or everything?
murray met him as well. were all the other players keen to meet him in the players lounge, as well?
do you remember seeing him play?
a year ago here you turned up at the o2, but you did seem particularly tired by the end of the season. is the fact that you have a davis cup final next week, does that help reenergize you and give you an extra lift at this time of year?
one more question on maradona. you said this is the first time you'd met him, but had some contact with him before.
how did that come about, that contact with him?
what have you done with the shirt?
novak, we remember robert de niro cheering for you in new york. perhaps in the future you are also an actor or is it because you are good in public relations? explain.
tomas, a sloppy start. did you feel too much pressure because it was your first match in the masters?
how difficult was it having gone down an early break in each set to actually fight back against djokovic?
how confident are you that you can find your form in the next two games? you have nadal and roddick still to play.
just wanted to know how you feel the court is playing as far as the pace, the bounce, and how it concerns your strengths.
usually in the tournaments you have a few rounds to become used to the surface and the tournament. is it very different to arrive here and directly play to the biggest player?
it was a difficult start for you.
is there a reason why you weren't there?
obviously the pace of the court was hugely different out there to what it was in paris last week. did that have any bearing?
how impressed were you with andy's performance today, his level? were you surprised how well he started?
as you just mentioned, you came to the net quite a few times, but he kept passing you. was that a predetermined strategy, to come in?
can you compare the speed of the court with last year? is it the same?
to qualify for the semifinal, you have two tough opponents. how do you feel about that?
is that about as good as it gets really?
you know how tough it is in these round-robins. but to come through in straight sets, dropping six games, that must be especially pleasing for you.
especially your backhand slice under pressure, you had to stay in a lot of rallies, especially in the second set. you confused him a lot of times with your slice and spins.
your return of serve, especially of the second serve, was exemplary today. any particular things you tried on that?
what did you think of the speed of the court, particularly compared with last year?
there is a possible matchup against roger on tuesday. how much do you take that you beat him the last two times you played him?
robin said he felt that he wasn't really there in the first set. were you surprised the way he came out today?
(question regarding the crowd.)
did you have any input into the new kit you're wearing today?
it's like the lendl style, the old style?
last year the fact you didn't get a straight-sets win counted against you. how important do you think it is to get that today?
soderling praised your defensive game in this match. you have agreed now that you were defending. are you planning to keep defending in the next matches? is that going to be your style during this week or are you planning to attack more?
to jump to the no.1 position in the world, will you have to attack more?
how happy were you with your serve today?
as a player, how different is the experience playing here compared to the centre court? obviously a different surface. is one more appealing to you than the other?
if you could give us your thoughts on tonight's match with roger federer.
the second set was very close. do you feel a little hard done by that score line?
federer had quite a bit of support in the crowd during the match. did that affect you at the start of the match?
the bounces are very low here. is it okay for you or not really?
at 5-4 in the second set, on the breakpoint, you made a crucial mistake on your forehand. do you remember that?
this year you changed your racquet. what is the weight and how much are the strings?
how much are the string?
all the time?
really not a big difference out there between the two. just real close match. what do you think was the difference?
the second tiebreak, you were at the net and it was very difficult for you to stop the point and he passed you.
i would like to know, for you it was a turning point?
yes, but because you were on fire at this time.
you seem very sincere about his value to the game in your speech on the court. do you want to elaborate on that at all? is he just generally a good guy?
always tough to lose in any circumstance, especially a final. when you catch your breath down the line, what do you think your take will be on the tournament as a whole?
you're known for your great play in tiebreakers. yet in some big matches over the past 10 months or so, kind of rough. was that just a fluke that you...
a definitive match in a slam is pretty much a big match, i would feel.
heading straight to another masters series event isn't easy, but you must be taking a lot of confidence.
from what you've seen of ivan these last few days, how would you assess his chances of getting back into the top 10 right now?
it will be up to 13.
you talked about the bridge to rowdiness yesterday. did you feel it was a pretty decent bridge? did you feel some pretty good support out there today?
it's about time you time won one of these.
so what's the next ambition?
you're going on to clay, which is probably not your best surface, but...
how much does this extra relaxation, new fitness regime, the quality of this win change your outlook for this year?
you're not going to take davydenko's approach, saying people should be scared of you?
you were gracious on court when you spoke about andy, but some people sort of dismiss his game as just power only. could you talk about what he brings to the sport of tennis and what you value, what you see?
you say he's playing better now than...
can you talk about your play today in the tiebreakers?
in the second set tiebreak, do you think that ninth game of that set was really the crucial game when you saved those break points?
how much confidence did you get from this tournament and from that third set against rafa? how did that confidence help you relax in the tiebreakers today against andy?
you speak with a lot of respect for andy roddick; you call roger federer your friend. in the past in tennis, relationships between players have often been much more fractious. we hear nadal speak of federer and federer speak well of his fellow players. what do you attribute the change in atmosphere to?
you're sort of talking in a big perspective here, and you've played season after season, tournament after tournament. for playing the sport, traveling the world all these years, what do you think is the prime thing you've learned from this sport?
andy made mention of this. did you ever consider retiring?
how will you plan to celebrate this victory, and how will that be different from your birthday celebration?
with your prize money, are you gonna buy something special for your son?
when you were practicing with roger before the start of this tournament, did you even think, dream about the prospect of sitting here right now?
how's your bracket looking?
what does it mean to you to get to the finals here, and what would it mean to win this tournament?
can you talk a little bit about that end of that second set and the third set. he broke you late, and then he broke back early. what was going through your mind, and how do you get it back on track?
ivan was asked about playing you or soderling, and he said he had gotten the sense you were pushing the ball back a little bit. that you were serving well, but his impression was that you were pushing the ball.
you don't feel that way, obviously.
what kind of match are you looking for tomorrow?
what do you think you've been doing well this week that's been helping you play well?
returning deep, returning hard?
you won a bunch of tournaments. what would it mean to win this one, considering the field and everything that's kind of gone on the last couple years?
after memphis and san jose, did you just go home and get healthy? did you do anything specific workout-wise? what's been the change?
the reputation of this area is sort of quiet and sleepy, kind of place full of rather ancient people. do you think they can get going tomorrow and maybe play an important part in the outcome?
i didn't say it wasn't great.
but do you think these nice gentle...
can you talk about just playing a final in america compared to finals everywhere else? how has that been different for you?
let's go to the hoops. how do you break it down?
what happened to your bracket?
had you ever heard of ali farokhmanesh?
what's the biggest shot where you would be, no, i shouldn't; oh, yes, i should've?
i was talking about tennis.
when you came off the court today, did you say anything to larry?
anything in particular today about the finals or anything like that?
talk about your finesse game. you had some great retreats earlier in the tournament and a really nice dropshot today. is it just a lot more confident? do you feel more comfortable? just talk about your finesse game.
people tend to come to these events with an expectation that probably one of the top 4 will be in the final. what do you think it says about the strength of the men's game that it's you against ivan tomorrow?
is this event as important as miami? there's a certain sense the energy is going to miami this year.
rafa, can we talk about the singles match first?
what happened in the tiebreak? it seemed like you were a little passive almost in the tiebreak.
as you said, you played very good tennis this week, the first tournament back since the australian open.
how do you assess your game now? and can we assess it before you return to clay, or no?
how good is your level now? can we say you are back to your best, or do we need to wait until you are back on clay before we can say that?
don't you think that the last thing there is still missing in your game is the ability to kill a match?
in the meantime, you are thinking too much at what is happening? you think too much than before?
so after you missed the forehand volley, second point of the tiebreaker...
but then after that you lose five points. was it all nerves there, or...
this week you played very well with your forehand, very aggressive.
maybe the last year you try to improve a lot your backhand, your volley. maybe you want to use mainly your forehand, your biggest weapon now.
he did say, ljubicic, that he thought the important thing, other than serving, was that he stayed with you in the rallies. did you feel like he was staying with you?
do you remember last time you lost seven points in a row in a tiebreaker?
masters cup?
does being 31 get better and better?
did anything in the first set give you hope that what you were doing - even as you lost - that made you think, yeah, i still have a chance?
17 aces obviously was great, but your second serve probably...
you managed to get a lot of kick.
do you think he became a bit less aggressive as the match went on? he seemed to start more aggressive and maybe just pulled back.
there's obviously still one step to go, but having the week that you've had, beating the no.2 and no.3 players in a week, what's that say about you and where your game is at the moment?
you were saying yesterday going into the match that you felt you had to hit four or five winners to win a point, but today that wasn't necessarily the case. you played patient at times against him.
can you just talk about andy or robin, what each final might be like tomorrow depending on who you might play?
most young boys have very protected almost innocent lives, yet you have that incredible experience when you were 13 years old, escaping the war zone. is that something that is still a part of you? do you reflect on that?
of course you had your great moment in the davis cup here in southern california, so you kind of like playing in this part of the world.
did you ever think you'd see the day when nadal would be out of the singles and in the finals of the doubles?
you've had to wait a long time for your second win against rafa. how much sweeter is it getting him at one of his favorite venues where he is a twice champion?
can you talk about the dynamics of playing in an american tournament if you do play andy tomorrow?
are there any parts of your career where you feel like you could have done things different or made some mistakes that might have had things go a little bit better?
couple things you might offer on that you want to talk about?
so what did you feel the key to the victory was today?
so you felt like you had to mix it up a little bit, be patient?
did you feel he moved as well as you would have expected?
it must feel nice to be in your first masters 1000 semifinal?
why do you think you struggled here?
do you think that a year or two ago when you didn't serve out the match from being 30-love up, he had a quick service game and then you were love-30 down, that you might have let the match slip away, but this time you came back and brought it back?
you've beaten andy roddick the two times you've played him. why did you have success against him?
can you talk about those tiebreakers against andy? because i think you won all of them. out of the three tiebreakers you play, you won all of them. why have you been successful in the tiebreakers against andy roddick? what's the key?
would be consider this win over murray your biggest after the nadal victory?
it seems like everything in your game has improved over the last year or 18 months. what's the biggest reason for that? what's the most important?
how did you change? did you use sports psychologists?
that's not an easy thing to do, is it?
how do you feel the way you're playing in this tournament?
how would you assess the quality of your all-around game in that first set today?
other than his serve, what would be considered roddick's best qualities as a player?
a lot of people think of him more of a super-aggressive player, but would you say in a lot of ways he's more of a consistent player from the back court?
when you take the courts against the very top players, the murrays, nadals, federers, have you made the transition from thinking if i play well i have a chance to thinking i have a good chance or i expect to win this match?
going back to your game, if there's something you feel like you could still add or something you'd like to add to your game, what would that be?
given that you've been a very talented and good player for a number of years now, are you surprised it's taken you this long to reach a semifinal of a masters series?
besides sort of the generosity on his last service game, you have to feel pretty good about the performance today.
did you see him trying to do anything different? because you figure coming into the match given his record against you he might try to change it up. did you feel him do that, or was it pretty much the same kind of thing?
is it a challenge for you when you go into a match and you've dominated the guy?
little extra psych-out for a match like that?
so you've been happy with the return overall?
you hit the ball on your serve about five feet in front of the baseline. were you taught that? is that something that you learned naturally?
at the research center we have an it right to the inch. sometimes you're 5'1", sometimes 4'11".
they're both great.
you want to talk about the guys coming up? they both present big challenges, i would think.
i saw earlier in the week you were twittering about how much fun the player parity was. can you talk about the ambience of that and this event and maybe how that's figuring into your performance?
lessons coming up from billie jean?
four out of six years you've made the semifinals here. can you talk about playing here and what kind of works for you and your success?
talking about your age, can you talk about the younger americans coming, john and sam, and what you think of their progress and even also their relationship as doubles partners?
i think you do.
has larry talked to you about the fact that he won this title 25 years ago?
not today?
when is the last time he talked to you about it?
what kind of things did he say about that title he won here 25 years ago?
can you talk about the evolution of your rivalry with murray from the first time you played him in '06 all the way up through wimbledon, how things have changes, how you approach playing him, how you think he's playing?
even a guy like him, though, probably forced you to improve? i mean, beyond roger and rafa, he got you a couple times in the beginning.
to be able to beat him at wimbledon last year, you had to improve, also.
regarding nadal, are you surprised after the layoff that he seems to be playing a pretty high level quickly?
what are your thoughts on the match?
do you think you had a chance to take over the momentum when you broke him late in the second set and had a big service game, as well?
you talked about your movement. was there something hampering you today?
was his form in the first set the best he's played against you?
novak congratulated your serving. do you feel like you served particularly well today?
it seemed like he thought that he was going to be more consistent than you were. he wasn't aiming to take real control of the points. he was just keeping the ball more in play. was that your impression?
it seemed like a pretty good atmosphere out there, too. the fans were really into it.
what's the difference between stadium 1 and stadium 2 for you?
can you explain how tough the next davis cup with serbia and croatia is going to be?
what will it take to actually get any real change in the schedule? it's something that's been talked about for some time. we've had players come into the press conferences here and talk about how short the break is between the end of the season and then getting ready for the australian open.
how much can be read into this match regarding davis cup?
there's nothing about today that would change that decision for you?
novak said he's still a little bit drained from davis cup last week.
can you sympathize with what he went through?
your expectations not having played him before, was it the same as you thought, like you thought it was going to be playing against rafa?
how would you play him next time? would you adopt any different strategy?
did you feel this court was too slow to do that?
how was it just to deal with him off the ground in general?
could you read him at all off the ground, or did it take you a while to figure out what some of his patterns were?
he returns well; he's been serving well. how do you feel like you served today?
so how does this fit into the chain of recent experiences, davis cup and winning your first title and all the things you've been going through the last couple of months?
it was pretty hot out there. how did you feel in the third set?
when you talk about gobbling, now you're top 20, the mountain gets a little different at that stage. how do you think about that, you know, how to play those guys like murray in australia and djokovic and nadal?
coming to net against him, how quick is he at picking up some of those volleys? i guess you really have to stick it, or he's right there.
you're doing awfully well right now. do you think what the difference would have been, say, you'd gone on the tour at 19 or 20 or not gone to college?
when you were 18, if somebody told you you'd be where you are now or where you were at 20, would it have been...
are you gonna put a lot of time in on the clay, or are you thinking keep it fairly limited because your better chances will come at wimbledon?
houston, rome, madrid? what else?
arag cup?
looking for another shot at novak on clay?
are you gonna play doubles at all those clay events?
and the slam events?
did novak ask you guys to come over and play? is that how it happened?
ivan already gave you a lot of trouble in dubai. was today a very different match?
is it fair to say that you never really sort of felt comfortable or found your groove this tournament?
are you glad to have a little bit of rest, even if it means you had to lose that you get that?
probably you don't have any regrets, but any regrets for playing davis cup or not?
will you look forward to playing him again in the next round of davis cup?
there's one more tournament before the clay court season. is it gonna be important for you to make a statement there at miami before we switch over to the clay?
have you rescheduled? last year, i mean, you had a great clay court season, and you came into roland garros a little bit tired.
so it's the same exact schedule as last year?
talking about schedule, i mean, can you just talk about your thoughts about the davis cup scheduling? putting it so close to a big tournament like this and having you have to make that decision or push to prioritize?
now how does it work? will you fly to miami tomorrow? will you take a couple days off?
anything you want to see in particular?
it's better at night.
can you just talk about how you feel about your game right now after getting to the quarterfinals?
what about the conditions out here? it seems like we hear a lot of the players talking about the conditions are kind of tough, and then you look at some of the results, and, you know, seems like a lot of players are struggling out here. are the conditions out here kind of different?
it just seems like a lot of people are having a lot more unforced errors and struggling hitting the ball. is there something out there about maybe the courts or the air?
you've started the year at the australian open the last couple years and done very well. do you feel like this is a major tournament to you that will make a big difference in your career here this week?
can you comment about the heat? is the heat okay for you?
seemed about as clean of a match as you can play. did you feel that way today?
you have had really good success against melzer and you know him well. what kind of match do you expect?
as a leading american player, you know what it's like to get the attention. i'm just wondering, tiger woods says he is coming back and he's playing the masters. do you have any feeling what it's like playing on the other side?
when you were no.1, was it different than it is now? in other words, were people chasing you and demanding stuff?
is playing out here a test in the sense of the elements? because the other day when you and james were playing doubles, the wind was blowing from like two different directions at once; starts out cold in the beginning when sometimes you play at night. this afternoon the conditions were pretty good. you think southern california, it's going to be sunny and warm, right?
are you confident about the next generation coming up behind you of american players? because right now, people, the average sports fan walking down the street, they don't know some of the other guys. what can be done to get some of these guys out there, you know, espn more stuff like that?
this is a great time of year for sports. tiger was mentioned. the tournament is going to start tomorrow. if you had to list your top five favorite sports, maybe college football first, i'm guessing, but what would be your five list?
i know you're a wimbledon fan. you love the allure. any similarity you think to augusta, even though you haven't been there?
finally, you're pretty proud of hoops picks. who's gonna cut down the nets?
you have had a decent year. you lost to verdasco, you won in brisbane, and then reached two quarters. do you like the way you're going? are you healthy now that the nerve thing is gone?
was that sort of out of an obligation because they're u.s.-based events?
can you talk a little bit about any new wrinkles you and larry are working on? just the relationship, kind of an update on that.
you've worked with some pretty good minds in tennis. would you ever think about going coachless for a while?
larry's known for a lot of things: fitness, core, core elements, techniques, cutting down errors. how would you categorize his coaching philosophy?
you have had pretty decent results here, semis last three out of the six years, but you've also indicated that it's hard for you to get a feel here. do you find you're starting to get a better gauge here at indian wells under these conditions here?
you've been at the top for america for a long time. it's a very difficult task, and obviously everybody appreciates it. to what do you attribute your ability to stay up there?
i have to ask, do you like those nike shorts that you've got now? they're certainly different.
just for this tournament?
many people liked the pink shirt at roland garros last year. they thought it was very, very nice. but because of the result we won't see that shirt anymore?
it was a match that you won fairly straightforwardly, but i don't remember seeing you win points so quickly before. i mean, many of the rallies lasted four or five shots or fewer and the point was over, so is that something you've been working hard on for the hardcourt season?
how are you feeling with your confidence? it's a tricky thing. how are you feeling?
do you feel confident?
do you feel after the month off, like after two matches that you know what to do in the matches? you don't feel rusty or...
but in the matches. it's different to practice than to play.
i think you are very happy with your performance today, especially with your serve. the idea or the goal is just to minimize the rallies in case you just get to the final again?
you have to be pretty happy with that serve. i think you only lost five points on your serve today. is that the best you've served in a while?
today andre agassi apologized for some of the things he said at the match friday night with pete, saying, you know, he was sorry that he called pete cheap and they were joking around a little bit. what was your take on that friday night?
did you take it that they were just having fun with each other, joking, back and forth?
with your knees and all, are there things you've done differently with your training? with your knees, have you done different things in your practice or training? have you altered things doing different things more or less?
it is?
if you play your best, do you actually expect to win the matches? do you feel like the matches are in your hands if you play your best?
novak said today he grew up and pete was kind of his idol. did you watch pete and andre? did you have one as your favorite more than the other when you were growing up?
seems like it's very important to you now that you can play for six to eight months in a row and show your best tennis. last year when you were having physical problems, do you just want to put that behind you and say, look, here i am; my best level is still there; don't worry about me?
never a doubt, eh?
match was never in doubt?
when you're down a match point, did your coach tell you how to play or think with a match point, or does that come all from your own brain?
on that game where you were down three match points, did you pick up the level of your serve, do you think, or what happened there?
then when you're down love-40 like that, do you quit worrying so much? do you just play more freely because you have nothing to lose at that point?
have you decided you're going to run for the council again?
have you decided you're going to run for the players' council again?
what do you consider your biggest accomplishments on the council?
when the hat came off, what was that all about?
apart from the win itself, what other positives do you take out of today's match?
the other night pete sampras did an imitation of andre. have you seen that?
he obviously has a lot of strengths, but what was the one thing that really inspired you? was it his strokes? his commitment to being no.1?
did you have a good conversation? did you learn anything about him?
did you meet at an organized event, or was it just randomly around town?
if you can take anything from pete's game and put in your own game, what would be it would it be?
not the net game?
talk about his serve. what, is it from a different planet, or what makes it so special?
yeah.
playing first, did that bother you at all?
did you have any trouble changing your clock last night? you lost one hour of sleep.
did you know anything about matosevic before the match?
what do you think?
how did you feel you played?
was the return to the practice court straight after the match just to get a few cobwebs out, or do you think you needed a bit more hitting?
did you feel a bit tense today?
what pleased you most about your performance out there today, andy?
do you feel as though you completely got the disappointment from the australian open final out of your system now? is that history for you?
when you're not serving well, is there anything you can do? obviously you like to serve well every day, but what is it you do when you're not serving well?
good way to start? where are you sort of, james, just in terms of what your goals are and what you want to get out of the season at this point?
does that make you edgier when you see the draw?
how did you feel watching davis cup, or did you?
kind of a tough situation if i have it right with your racquets. what's up? what's happening?
do you treat your racquets sort of like a stradivarius?
they just can't find the right materials?
how many do you have? how many racquets do you have left?
really?
you need to take a different racquet on the side, so if you want to smash it you can walk over...
when you say it doesn't feel right, what is it that doesn't feel right?
where does the string fit into this?
so obviously this is a tennis tournament, but a little more than a year ago you came out more articulate earlier than just about anyone in support of the president. now it kind of feels like it's the middle of the fourth set at roland garros or something. could you give us a little thought about your thoughts about his situation?
back to the racquet for one second. barring a fit of destructive anger, do they have a life? i mean, do you find after a certain period of time they get a little dead or...
they crack?
you travel around the circuit with three racquets?
did you play memphis with them or a different frame?
you played australia with a different frame?
was the brand w?
you're carrying more racquets than the three, right? you're carrying something you don't care for?
let me ask a different question. you mentioned books and so forth, and andre's book, he does talk about the match at the us open. he praises you and says it's great to be a part of one of the greatest night matches in tennis history. but he said at one point he did look in your eyes and he sensed that you weren't going for it. what were your thoughts about his passage? his take on that?
sometimes your forehand just, like you hit one in memphis that was just out of this world. what is that feeling when you just crunch that forehand for an outright winner a billion miles an hour?
you've had the top few players on the council for the first time ever and coming up in a couple years now. do you have any sense of like what their agenda is or, you know, what their top priorities are and also if they've had any effect on where the tour is headed?
do you have a clear sense of what it is they wanted to accomplish? you mentioned schedule. based on what the players have been saying the last few months doesn't sound like much progress.
at a certain age?
that's come in since they've been on the council?
you spoke about forehands. i want to segue to foursomes. i think you played some golf maybe over the weekend.
was it pete, you, andy, and mardy?
so of the three tennis players, how did we do? what's the leaderboard?
no. the next question is: pete's style is a big serve, big forehand, athleticism, comes to the net. does that translate to golf at all?
was that good buildup for the australian open, a good week?
what didn't work for you in the last set there?
what was going through your head in the tiebreak?
is the support that marcos gets a bit distracting or good fun? how do you see it?
is that the perfect preparation for the australian open?
do you get an extra lift when you walk into melbourne park?
have you had a look at the draw?
where is your confidence at in comparison to other australian opens you've gone into?
is australia a second home for you?
so you obviously love coming to australia.
you showed a lot of emotion when you won tonight. talk about how you felt when you won.
how long will you sign autographs for outside, or will you take a back door exit?
you must be delighted?
how long has it been since you played this many matches in a week?
right.
so this must be very sweet for you --
-- to be back that level?
how tough has it been for you the last six or so months getting back on the court after the innuendo and sniggers?
were you tired today because you had played so many matches this week, or you're still a little bit mentally tired from the fight.
you said earlier in the week that you were just hoping not to get one of the top four players in the australian open draw. have you seen the draw with youzhny?
are you happy with where your game is?
you knew it was won. you had your hands raised.
you must be pleased, because in the second set you were a break down and you had to come back.
have you ever won a match like that before on a net cord, the last point?
you can't remember?
if you play marcos baghdatis in the final, i think it'll be the first time you've met, which surprising given that he's lived in france.
it would be interesting, because you're both guys trying to climb again, because he had injuries last year.
are you aware of the french history of this tournament? guy forget last won it in 1991.
you obviously must be pretty delighted with that, quite a hard-fought victory.
what does it mean to make the final after you were disrupted the last few years because of injury?
and richard, you've obviously both live in paris and played there, but you've never played before.
no.
how did you go at the junior level?
towards the end of the tiebreak, mardy...
third-set tiebreak. mardy challenged as you netted a forehand volley. i think it was at 4-5. were you aware that he had made that challenge?
how much did you have left in the tank? could you have kept going on if the tiebreak had gone on and on?
how hard is it on a day like today? do you keep an eye on the australian open draw? is it hard not to have a sneaky peek?
a lot of players are already down in melbourne hitting up and getting used to the courts. do you find more match practice is beneficial for you?
you and richard are at very similar points. obviously both trying to break back into the top 10. do you see this as the first step to getting back to it top?
that's obviously not the way that you were wanting it to end. after getting the first set there, you a good position in the second set. where did it go wrong?
the lifting in intensity and your inability to go with it, do you think that's sort of good for your preparation?
he was getting a lot first serves in.
does a result like that leave you disappointed, or what do you take from it?
how did you find the conditions? windy?
you prefer it a bit hotter?
it's been two years since you played marcos. did you see any differences in his game, any areas that surprised you?
looking ahead to the draw tomorrow, you're obviously in a better position than last year with the ranking now.
probably nice not to draw someone higher up.
couple of foot faults there at crucial points cost you. frustrating that they came in?
serena is not the only one to get foot faulted.
any messages to your fans out there from today's match that you want to pass on in light of the australian open?
today's loss. is it a hiccup rather than a major drama?
niggles okay?
how many more melbourne parks do you think you've got in you?
playing.
how much more, lleyton, have you got to step up now, even though you're gonna get a good first round?
when will you go to melbourne?
you were a semifinal last year here. how satisfying do you feel after last year to be back in the semis?
do you feel like your play is getting better?
you return the ball very well today.
you seem pretty confident you'll to get back to where you were two years ago.
do you feel like you've got a good opportunity to win this tournament?
give us your thoughts about the next match, benneteau or mayer.
what was the difference in the second set that helped you turn things around?
how far away do you think your best tennis is? the second and third sets were pretty impressive.
what did you make of lleyton's game today?
how did the conditions affect you today? obviously reasonably cool. did you go right quite well in the heat?
obviously a slow start there, 6-1.
how does this rank as sort of your victories?
that eighth game i this in the second set, that was probably a big turning point.
i suppose it was a big change from center court out to court six today.
how much of a part do you think that did play?
i suppose the first game of the second set, that would have given you a fair bit of confidence.
the dropshot was the key weapon. is that you studied and thought about from watching him play?
last year seemed to work quite well for you. is that the similar plan, traveling to the higher end tournaments this year and traveling with the family?
you've got a nice situation for yourself and lleyton, quarterfinals of the same event.
how much of a boost has it been with lleyton and his support being on board as far the davis cup is concerned?
mardy fish. much experience with him?
playing someone like roddick and another big sever like berdych, does that give you more confidence against someone like fish?
have you a allowed yourself to look ahead at the possible matchup with lleyton?
was that okay, or would you have preferred longer on the court?
how did you pull up, lleyton?
obviously a much-anticipated game next against baghdatis. the fans are looking forward to it. how much are you looking forward to it?
be happy not to finish the match against him at 4:30 in the morning this time?
does that stick in your head though, that match? it obviously does for a lot of people given the timing and everything else, but it was an epic clash in all respects.
you had the two good wins in perth and the win here. is it just setting up the right messages for yourself and everybody else watching you as well?
have you heard much about the world cup of tennis? do you know much about it, or are you sportive of the concept? what do you think it might do to davis cup?
it's a 32-nation competition supported by the likes of federer coming into play the next couple of years, a knock-out-style tournament played over ten days. a little bit of talk that something like that would potentially long-term replace the davis cup.
do you think the davis cup the way it's structured right now bears perhaps replacing in the next few years? restructuring?
the back holding up okay?
good hit out for you today?
feeling even small improvements from your two games in brisbane last week to here?
will playing against lleyton be another step up obviously?
after the rough ride you had in 2008, did you really have a chance to pat yourself on the back, because you finished 2009 so well after all the injuries? did you feel like you needed to do pat yourself on the back, congratulate yourself?
can you explain your shirt. you normally wear adidas.
is a davis cup shirt?
do you see similarities between yourself and lleyton on how you're both trying to get back to where you were maybe two or three years ago?
from what you've seen of him, is top 10 realistic for him? he's getting on age-wise.
do you feel you should be there too, in the top 10?
talk us through that. i know you'll be disappointed with that.
do you think after brisbane and meeting someone like andy roddick...
are you prepared for all the expectations on your shoulders as you're getting a name for yourself already?
good start in the tiebreak there. 3-1. were you disappointed that you sort of a let that slip?
how much did you learn about your game last week, and what do you think you need to do to go the next step?
you the type after a match you just dissect it in your mind too much, or do you get rid of it because you got next week?
i guess it's a case of all these matches adding up to experience.
you notice your profile getting bigger in the states, too, because of l.a. and sam querrey? did you notice that?
where have you spent more of your time?
what made you...
do you feel australian?
is rafael better than ever before?
how tough was it out there?
do you think he's back to his best level?
what do you think, generally speaking, you have to do to try to beat this guy on clay? what is the tactic?
what happened when you called the trainer?
he was already giving you a headache?
did you feel you became a little nervous towards the end of the match?
you had lost to him very badly also in roland garros. has it changed anything from there? is it exactly more or less the same difference?
but you are a much stronger player now than you were probably two years ago. how do you explain the score was still so bad?
what do you think you needed to do a little bit better today to make it a real contest and have a chance to maybe get some doubt in his head?
only on clay or all surfaces?
behind nadal, who are the best clay court players that you think are in the top five?
yes.
what did you do the best today?
what kind of tactic was so good for you?
what does it mean for you to reach a big final like this?
which would you say is the best surface for fernando verdasco? hard court? clay?
what is the best surface for you to face rafael?
some players say the clay here is faster than indian wells. do you believe?
tsonga.
yes.
this year.
when you look back in your career, do you see the match you lost to nadal at the australian open as your biggest lost opportunity or you see it in a different way?
especially the match point?
talk about the condition you were in before that famous match and now. do you feel you're in the same shape?
the one in australia. do you feel as well?
do you still go sometimes in vegas to practice or do physical training with gil reyes, the agassi group?
if you win tomorrow, it will be the sixth time in a row and you will become the first player in the open era to do that. it's crazy, no?
no, in any tournament.
i understand when you say you want to finish your career before deciding what is the best record. up to today, what do you consider your best record of all? you have so many already. which one is really standing out?
and of all the records that roger federer has, what do you think is the one that stands out, the most impressive?
more than the 16 slams?
you always say it's been a tough match. after ferrero, after ferrer you said the same. how do you explain the easy-looking score line every time?
is this the best you've felt you're playing for some time now?
with all the airplane problems going out, do you already know how you're going to get back home or to the next tournament?
do you agree to say you play much better here this year in monte-carlo than last year?
what's the biggest change?
you seem very composed, calm, when you're playing.
calm and composed, relaxed. is this because you had maybe some problems before, you're not feeling this frustration, your mind is clear?
the other semifinal is not over. djokovic lost the first set. how do you see it different for you to play djokovic, to play verdasco? one is more a friend than the other or both are friends?
technically what is the difference?
how proud are you to have so many spanish players, verdasco is not so strong before, how proud are you when verdasco is playing at this level?
do you think because you're playing so well, the other players are playing well, the spanish players?
maybe you beat yourself with unforced errors.
what do you think he does very, very well?
seems you were not physically okay today on the court. were you sick?
you got only five free points on your serve today. was that the biggest trouble for you for the moment?
after such a game, what is your general mood?
do you think it's a problem of confidence?
what happened exactly in the second set? you were up, 5-1, match points, then 5-2, match points, then blackout.
you said on the court you hit something?
why?
were you thinking on the court of the nine losses you got in the quarters in the masters series?
tomorrow is going to be your first semifinal in a masters series. what does it mean for you?
have you seen novak's match?
how is your back this week?
are you satisfied with your performance, your form, everything?
there was never any moment when you think you played poorly?
how different is it going to be the match with ferrer? what is the big difference between the two players? since you have lost to ferrer at the us open and masters cup, clay for you is much different for you than probably for him?
do you feel safer on clay as opposed to hard court with your knees?
do you speak any spanish?
which feeling do you have to be the only non-spanish here?
you mentioned your serve a lot this week. were you happy with it today?
he is a very dangerous opponent. what did you do tactically? tactically you had a clear mind of the way to play him?
you arrived here not having played very well before. are you where you wanted to be now in terms of tennis?
when you arrived here, you had not good matches before. are you pleased with the level you have? are you where you wanted to be now?
you say nalbandian is one of the players you hits the most cleanly. you hit very clean today because you need to do that to move him around. were you happy with how you were hitting it?
and against a spanish player, what do you have to do?
so what didn't work today? your serve? the volley maybe?
you used your backhand pretty well, especially down the line. remember that first match point? you didn't use that kind of backhand against almagro.
you had pretty long matches. do you still feel fresh?
isn't that frustrating?
what broke your strings? did it have any influence on you during that first set?
does this match give you more ambition for the rest of the season? you played well.
in the end you went to shake his hand with a smile. is that what it means?
yesterday you were talking about having fun on the court, but apparently it was not the case today.
but still in some games there was very little difference between you.
we noticed when you were more aggressive on your return on second serves, he was sometimes making errors.
what next?
are you surprised about how kohlschreiber beat murray?
are you surprised by how easily you won?
how was it to be back here on center court?
this court especially, do you like it, the view?
you play berrer next round.
you beat him recently, berrer.
you beat him quite easily on hard court. what do you expect on clay from him?
better?
happy with that?
when you say the serve could be better, you tried to go back to your old serve or...
you try to bend your arm more?
is that something you analyzed specifically, sat down with a video recorder, taken the serve apart?
the fact you were playing on a court where you have so many good results, does it help?
when you say sooner or later you'll get back to your old serving, do you have a time scale on that, how long it's going to take you?
is it one of the reasons why you play doubles here? you intend to play some more doubles in order to work on your game?
do you enjoy it, playing doubles?
what do you need to do better tomorrow?
you look much better than the last few matches you play. do you feel much better, too?
julien said he felt like a bull in the bullring on the court today. what is your take on that?
he felt like you were playing around with him.
did you expect to play so well for the first match this week?
do you think that you played acapulco makes your adaptation faster on clay court or you think it's no connection?
when and why have you signed a new endorsement with the racquet with dunlop?
are you comfortable with this one?
better than the last one?
can you talk about the french guys, their level since the beginning of the season, and what are their chances on clay?
yes.
talent is one thing, but what do they have to improve the most? their mental and physical?
but sometimes if you have to face them...
would you say at this moment monfils has the best chance on clay of the french?
this is a classic, serra-robert.
it was tougher than last time?
he has a very special game, doesn't he?
how did you come to casablanca?
your weakness is you often put too much pressure on yourself?
how did you manage to be more relaxed?
this is easy to say but not as easy to do.
what is your head-to-head against novak?
apparently his game suits you?
do you believe he's going to make many double-faults?
do you have any regrets? you were not far?
what happened?
in the second set, you were almost able to come back again?
you are becoming more and more consistent at a higher level now.
what is your program now?
how would you describe the past months?
you had some very good streaks during the match, but it was very difficult for you to play consistently for the whole match.
it was very tough physically for you?
can you explain this injury exactly.
are you taking any risk by playing all the same?
can you practice as you wish?
can you ignore the pain when you play?
how long have you felt the pain?
what kind of treatment do you have?
and will you feel the pain in the french open?
how much time will you need to be back to your best level?
what is your schedule now?
at 3-all you were playing very well. do you believe that was your best tennis?
you had nothing to lose?
are you disappointed?
you're now playing doubles?
what is your schedule now?
tough, tough, tough?
you had no solutions?
did you expect to suffer so much?
you never played such a strong player on clay?
is his ball really heavy with his forehand?
but in the first set you tried to play serve and volley.
what is your schedule now?
where are you going to do that? in the stadium of roland garros?
after a second difficult set, what do you feel?
how did you explain this downswing?
did you want to be aggressive?
this monte-carlo tournament, is it special for you?
novak said this morning that he would stop with martin and that he would keep vajda and he didn't want to have two different lines with two different coaches. how do you deal with eric and gabriel?
are there different directions sometimes?
who defines the rules?
do you think it can work?
what is new with the second coach?
what does gabriel bring to your game?
do you think that gabriel is the coach and eric is more support?
when you say you couldn't continue with eric alone a whole year...
so you're saying he is too old (laughter)?
your ranking in the atp is a consequence of what happened at the time.
what about berdych?
so before you were stronger.
if we had gasquet when he was young, and we would tell him what he would go through, would you have continued?
what happened? you had difficulties in playing really into the match?
what about training? how long did you have?
did you have the impression that you were back on track?
there was one point where i could see you were saying to yourself, stop playing tense. you were very tense, but you continued.
every year you seem to have difficulties playing on the clay courts.
how many forehand strokes do you need to be ready?
how many hours a day?
did you have a lot of pressure, because it was a clay court?
what about next week? barcelona, right?
so the season's start was quite busy?
you are 4-0 in atp finals. talk about why it is you think you do so well in championship matches.
several very hard matches during this tournament, short times between matches. how do you like it? maybe it will help you to be in good form.
only three breaks in the entire match. talk about the two that you won and how important those were.
what do you think will remain today to help you win? maybe the experience of a final or something else?
you look with more confidence than half a year ago. is it a new team or...
first ukrainian to win since medvedev 16 years ago. is that significant for you?
have you ever had a week like this where you've had to play so much, had matches suspended?
what part of this tournament was the most interesting for you and then the most hard and fun?
when you decided to come to this tournament, what were you hoping to get out of it? was it preparation for the us open, more hard court matches? was winning a title in the back of your mind or not?
your first atp final. you obviously would have liked to have won, but how was the experience for you?
there were only three breaks in the whole match. what was the difference? he seemed to be able to change the pace on occasion.
were you thinking in the third set you almost had a break, could do it, or was his serve just too good?
now going to the us open, you have to be pretty happy with how the week went overall in preparation for the major.
did you have a problem with your racquet at one point? did you switch racquets before the third set?
it's been a while, but you missed two years with a car accident. how has the climb back been? do you think you are now where you should be?
you feeling it after playing three matches in two days?
must feel good, heading to where you're going now?
you've won three times. what would a win mean here? where would you that rank amongst your other victories on the tour?
i think there was only one breakpoint in the first set and you took advantage of it. how important was that game to how the match turned out?
can you talk about your serve today. was it as good as you've had it this year?
in the past three times you reached the semifinals, you won all of those tournaments. is there a different mentality in the later rounds or a reason you improve so much towards the end?
you're not exactly a household name around here. looking on your website for information about you to share for readers, i have a couple questions. you listed the top five people you would bring to a party if you were allowed to, and they were bono, tom hanks, princess diana, boris yeltsin and a russian arms dealer. where did he come from, the guy who created the ak-47? kind of bizarre.
it says your perfect day would be to spend it with your girlfriend, hanging out with friends, a restful evening at home reading. is reading something that you're that passionate about?
you have three tournaments now in a couple years. do you feel you're almost there where you're going to take the next step?
do you feel your game is at that next level where you're almost with the elite?
can you talk about after that second set, he had you down. how did you get back your mental state?
can you talk about the drop volley you had in the first break in the third set that put you over the top there.
he said you both didn't play well. do you agree with that?
a lot of players use this week as a tune-up for the open. do you view it differently? you're looking to break through. do you view this differently than a so-called 'tune-up'?
what would it mean to you to win here?
is this your first atp tour final?
are you excited to be in the final?
are you familiar with stakhovsky's game?
is your mother your coach, as well?
how unique is that among tour players and how special is it for you?
just feel like you couldn't get your first serve in today?
were you surprised by some of the shots he was able to get to?
seemed like there was one point in the second set that typified how the match went. looked like you had it won a couple times. he came back. you looked up in the air and kind of said, what do i need to do here?
did it affect having the match pushed back to a 7:00 start?
can you tell me what's more satisfying for you, getting your first title of 2010 or finally reversing your streak against roger in atp finals?
you talked yesterday, i think it was about how you're expressing yourself a lot more on the court this week. can you talk a little bit more about that?
this is the second straight canadian open. do you think there is something in your training schedule that allows you to be in better shape at this stage of the season than the other players?
are you surprised to have won a big title without a coach?
you don't show a lot of emotion in victory. what are you feeling inside when you've won the match today?
if i'm not mistaken, you said something after the match about this being one of the best weeks of your life. you beat rafa and you beat roger. it might be hard to tell because cincy is coming up, but is this the most confident you've been going into a grand slam?
the decisive game in the second set you seemed to find something a little extra with your serve at deuce. is that a conscious thing where you try and add a little more, or is it just the adrenaline flowing at that point?
i know you touched on this a little, just a little bit a little earlier, but how satisfying is it to beat not only rafa and roger in the same tournament but also win the tournament along the way right now?
roger was in here and he said that now i guess that you've beaten him in the final or beaten both him and rafa, you don't have to prove a point anymore. do you or have you felt like you have something to prove having reached two slam finals?
you have actually a pretty good record against roger, a winning record, for your career. he has i think won one tournament now in about the last calendar year. is there a difference in roger now versus roger maybe a year or two ago, and if so, what is it?
do you think your current form is good enough to win the us open?
you mentioned the relaxed state of mind that you've had on the court. can you pinpoint what caused that? is that just a decision you've made to be more relaxed, or is it something that's happened to make you feel more relaxed?
tied at 3 in the first set you had a couple of chances to break his serve, and he kind of took over from there. why was he so hard to put away at some points today?
talking about your serve, before the game started, you took a few more minutes to practice your serve. were you feeling that that was going to be a problem?
some of the points were fantastic today, the standard of tennis, as usual between you and andy, very, very high. do you think that's the best he's played against you?
overall, how do you compare yourself to how you feel now versus a year ago? a year ago was very different from your point of view. how does it feel a year on after everything that's happened?
let's say everything is good, perfect. you go to the us open and you win the us open. what would that mean to you?
you said you needed to improve your serve and your backhand. did i hear you right? what's wrong with the backhand? you said you wanted to practice a bit more.
you said that you have a different feeling when you -- like you're going to go to cincinnati and see what the feeling was there. what was the feeling you had here in toronto?
i'm not sure, because you said there was a different feeling here, the feeling you were going to move on to cincinnati.
oh, you were talking about the court surface?
i thought it was something emotional or the crowds or...
you've won four of the last five on hardcourts against nadal. what do you think, if anything, the surface gives you an advantage over him?
yesterday david said that you played more aggressively than he's used to seeing you play, and today obviously, as well. how much of a conscious effort do you have to make, to play offense?
with nadal being the no.1-ranked player in the world, people are bound to call this a bit of an upset. do you see it that way, or when you play the way you did today, do you feel this is the result you should achieve?
you say your quarterfinal win was probably one of your best wins of the season. was this performance today a little bit better than that?
your concentration on court looked, i don't know, better than it normally does. i mean, you didn't go off or scream or anything. you just kind of moved from point to point and showed a little disappointment when you would lose a point, but actually it seemed like you were very focused. is there any truth to that?
you were mentioning that on one end of the court you had to make sure to hit it flatter because the wind was tricky. which end of the court was that?
you say you're having fun and coming in with the right game plan, and you don't have a coach right now. are you tempted to go it alone for a while?
you've had quite a few high-profile victories against rafa really over the last two years or so, majors especially. what do you think it is about your game that seems to frustrate or halt nadal pretty often?
i guess your record against federer isn't as good as nadal, especially in majors. if you are facing federer tomorrow, game plan? how can you beat him?
first set went by very quick, and the second set you were down 2-love, but somehow out of nowhere it seemed like you turned things around. what happened out there? why the difference?
any reason why you think you didn't have that rhythm when you came out in the first set? anything you can pinpoint?
what do you think as the rallies went longer that you thought you had the advantage?
at the end of the match you came to the net and you were smiling and you said something to him. if it's not too personal, can you tell us what you said?
are you the kind of player who gets angry at yourself after this, or do you try not to?
with that slow start, i mean, is this something you look at your serve in the first set trying to help you out at least a little bit, get some free points, maybe get a little 30-love lead in the game so that you can start to find the rally?
if you were to assess your performance this week compared to, say, a year ago, how good do you feel your form is right now?
i guess your unbeaten streak had to come to an end at some point. how well do you think you played today, and how well do you think andy played?
do you think when he plays like that he's even more dangerous? in other words, he maybe should be more aggressive because when it comes off for him it's hard to play against?
you mentioned that you're a little bit tired from the past weeks and stuff. do you plan on getting any rest before the us open or davis cup or anything to prepare better for that?
the mistakes you made in this match, would you blame that all towards fatigue, or do you think parts of your game were just not on?
you talked yesterday about the injury and time off giving you more motivation. i was wondering if, during this time, you kept looking back at any specific moments in your career, good or bad, that gave you inspiration.
can you speak about how effective your serve was today? definitely for the beginning part of your match, but i just looked at the stats, you know, and on the first serves you were almost dominant when you got the first serve in play. what do you think you could have done differently in the second and third set to maybe try to close the match?
rafa is obviously the no.1 player in the world for a reason. when you do play against him, is it that important to not drop a level at any point just because he keeps coming and coming and coming and coming?
is it your best match against him?
there have been a lot of great german tennis players in the past. how does it feel to be the no.1 ranked player in your country, and what does that mean to you at this moment?
i just want to follow up on a point you made before. what could you read maybe years ago in nadal's game that he's corrected that you can't read as much now?
do you think that maybe in your game you can maybe attack a little bit more in certain situations when, i don't know, you're down love-30 in a service game to maybe change it up for yourself for your future?
after he very nearly broke you, i think it was at 2-2, he was serving at 2-3 and he got finally to his advantage. you had him backed up. you had him pinned. he hit the forehand pass that just clipped the net. is that kind of the difference between rafa and maybe the rest of the tour right now is shots like that and that kind of moment?
do you think that having a one-handed backhand is a liability playing rafa? could you just talk a little bit about how you feel about having a one-hander right now?
talk about the crowd. the toronto crowd was just electric out there pulling for you, real nice to see. elaborate on that a little bit, your thoughts on that.
where does this victory rank, even with all the grand slam championships, but avoiding losing three straight to this guy coming back from 5-2, where do you rank this victory?
obviously this one's not on grass, but can you explain at all how the match went differently than wimbledon did, tactically or how -- was it played any differently from your point of view?
you said you were thinking about the miami match. are you thinking about that while you're playing?
do you want to shut that off while you're playing or do you mind that running through your head?
having lost to him the two previous times, did you feel at all that this is a match you had to win? did that create any extra pressure that may have hurt you?
in that situation where you have to break in that final set and you're getting multiple chances and then he's holding and you're going back and forth, what are you trying to tell yourself? stay calm? or are you thinking tactically at that point?
rafa was in here earlier talking about the difference between returning on clay, grass, and hardcourts, and he was saying that he was having or that it's more difficult on a hardcourt to kind of figure out when to be more aggressive or when to play neutral. how do you go about, you know, figuring out whether you're going to be aggressive on a second-serve return, for example, or whether you're going to chip it back and kind of play a more neutral point to begin the point?
you were serving to put it into a tiebreak in the second set and lost your serve. you had a couple double faults in that game. can you just talk about what was going on in your mind?
what do you look for for tomorrow between djokovic and chardy, whichever one? what do you look to improve on? what would you think you need to tighten up a little bit in the semis?
you talked last time about the shots the guys can hit now with the new strings crosscourt and all that. are there a couple of shots you feel you can hit with the new strings that you couldn't have before?
you've defeated some good players since you've come back in july, but robin is definitely in a different category. how does it feel to beat a top guy like him today?
what changes for you from the first set to the second, third? it seems like you really locked in, you started to hit your spots a lot better, and, you know, played real aggressive off the return. what changed, do you think?
is there any comparison to the way you're playing now to when you were playing at your best a couple years ago?
you just won your 11th straight match and you continue to knock off top seeds. is there anything you're doing different in your training maybe in conjunction with your rehab from your surgery that's contributed to that?
sometimes when athletes are out that long and they do come back, they gain a real appreciation for the game, maybe what they missed and they thought might have been fading away from them. coming back now and being healthy, is this more fun for you being on the tour? did you maybe take it for granted years ago, or can you explain maybe that a bit?
just the fact that you're healthy and playing again. like you said, you're 28 years old. maybe a year ago you might have thought your career might have been over with the severity of the injuries and undergoing hip surgery.
obviously his serve is the biggest weapon, and in the beginning you seemed to have a lot of trouble with it, but after about two-and-a-half games you were able to break him. what kind of adjustments did you make?
over and over again, you continue in the big moments to bring the best tennis. what is the secret formula? what do you do out there?
earlier this week federer was in this room and he was asked a question, would you guys ever get together as a team to play doubles? he says, and i quote, the media wouldn't like it because we see you guys as rivals, but he said, yeah, i would team up with him. so what do you say? when is the dream team getting together?
maybe next year at the rogers cup, you guys double up?
okay. i will get back to you.
i'm curious, when you were younger and you switched from hitting with your right hand to your left hand, how did your uncle toni come up with the idea to try that? and how difficult was it for you at that age to switch from hitting right-handed to left-handed?
spanish athletes seem to be winning everything these days, in tennis, cycling, football, basketball. how do you explain that?
i'd like to congratulate you and your country for what you've achieved so far. how do you see the support that you've generated so far in toronto compared to other places you've been this year?
can you comment on former no.1, thomas muster, asking for your assistance during the fall season in his comeback to tennis?
after traveling to south africa and being with the spanish team for the world cup, how do you compare the emotions you've had and the victories in tennis to there, and your emotions on the world cup?
you said you wanted to improve some things on yesterday. did you feel that you did, your movement and so on?
it was up and down, is that because he's an unpredictable guy?
how satisfying to come back as strong as you did from a pretty, by your standards, disastrous second set to finish off strongly in the third?
when you're out there without a coach, to whom do you turn? is it yourself? is it self-motivating? is it a kind of different dynamic for you just at the moment?
what about nalbandian next, one of the form guys on the tour, 11-match unbeaten streak, just won a tournament?
what goes through your mind during a set like that second one and then after it's over?
how long would you last if you landed on the court as many times as he did in that third set today?
that's not in your repertoire except for maybe a grand slam final?
you mentioned that you were a bit maybe sluggish moving around the court yesterday. seemed like you were running around fine today. were you happy with how you were moving around in that aspect?
nice to play some old-school tennis again today?
has anyone ever asked for your shirt after a match before? when was the last time you were on the receiving end of an underhanded serve?
you know, i noticed maybe more than the past when you're ahead in the games you're starting to try and shorten the points, serve and volley. is it something you focused on, or was it something that you've added with paul annacone or...
who else asked you for your shirt, and did you give it to them?
it was another player?
can you explain exactly how your association with paul annacone came to be? who approached who? did you speak with pete or tim to get their insider info on what he's like as a coach?
i watched you practice a little bit in miami this year, and you were with severin and hitting with dlouhy, i think. you were just having a great time. you were...
looked like you like tennis. today there were some points of levity, also. you kind of framed one shot and turned around and laughed. how important is that attitude for you throughout your career? how does it help you?
speaking of shirts, your choice of color has been generating a lot of buzz for some reason. do you get to choose what you wear, or does nike choose to put both you and rafa in pink this week?
you talked about having a fun match and some kind of fun shots. one that jumped out to me, it was like a half volley in the game that you won -- you went up 4-3. do you know the shot i'm talking about? it was a half volley over the net and it kind of spun back and looked like it hit your opponent in the face almost with -- there was so much spin on it.
you don't remember the shot? it was a good shot.
what are you looking to change -- i guess your next opponent, tomas berdych, you lost to him the last few times out.
you talked about how the game has changed in terms of the style. llodra, you used to see a lot more of those guys. what about the depth? you see at an event like this, you don't have a tsonga or del potro, and roddick is not here, and yet there seems to be match after match -- the depth, do you notice a change over the past decade?
are you still feeling your last davis cup experience good or bad? are you still feeling it at all?
can you talk about your match today? it seemed a lot more routine than yesterday. i'm sure the weather played a part in that for you.
i'm just wondering if you have talked to ana ivanovic with what's going on with her at the rogers cup in montreal. she feels that she was insulted by the tournament director, had her feelings hurt, wasn't included as a wildcard entrant, and then now they've extended an invitation to her and then she's declined. have you talked to her at all? do you understand what she is going through maybe at this time?
if you could talk to us for a moment about your doubles partnership with nadal, how did that come about? whose idea was it? do you see you guys playing together as a pair again in the future?
actually, before opening ceremony, nadal said very nice words about you, that you're very talented and good partner for double. you now lost, but what would be your relation, say, if you met each other in the final?
obviously disappointing to lose, but what was the experience like? did you feel you gave yourself justice?
even though you ended up losing, taking a guy like the no.1 in the world to a tiebreaker like that, do you still find that an accomplishment right now in your career?
you've clearly improved, you know, to the point where now just a couple points are determining the matches, and now as you're progressing to better levels of players, you know, first -- i was there for the atlanta match with isner where a couple points in the third set determined, you know, what was going to happen. even here tonight with nadal it was, you know, again just one or two points turns. do you go back and look at video? does your coach go back and see what could you have done differently? is that something that you guys focus on?
so just to bite on that a little bit, when you're training, are you working on these specific scenarios, doing certain things in certain moments like certain set plays?
can you talk about the win yesterday and what it meant to you? you lost to querrey three times. you play a similar game. your second-highest seed that you've beaten. the importance of that match.
i assume you're going to cincinnati? do you have to qualify again, same sort of situation you started this week?
do you feel that what you've done here is going to -- you've got to the third round of a north american hardcourt event. you're going to another one. confidence must be pretty high at the moment?
you had a bit of a letdown last year after 2008, and i know you changed coaches or you hired new coaches in the beginning of this year. what goals did you set up for yourself early in the season? are you progressing on those?
after such a long time without playing tennis, how difficult was it to find your rhythm today?
what was your goal coming into the match? were you trying to be more aggressive than normal or trying to play with more margin?
was that first-set tiebreak as much fun for you as it was for us? do you remember having a tiebreak like that at all?
did you have any doubts throughout the tiebreaker at all?
through the difficult parts, yeah.
you've complained in previous years coming into the us open series that your forehand was a little bit off to start on your first match. do you feel that that's something that you really want to improve going forward throughout the week, and if so, what do you need to do to get it to where you want it to be?
in previous years when you've arrived at this time of the season, it's often been quite difficult for you because you've had so many matches and you've been quite tired. how do you feel now compared to previous years? do you feel fresher?
has there ever been a year at the us open where you didn't feel like your physical condition was a reason for your loss? and what are you doing this year to make sure that doesn't happen?
like part of the reason for the loss at the
after you won the first set, stan's coach said that if stan plays the way he did in that set it speaks well for the future of his career. you've beat him many times. is this some of the best tennis you've seen from him?
your doubles experience with novak only lasted one match. how did you find the canadian pair that you played? and will you and novak team up again in the future?
your impressions on the whole match and how it went, please.
you took out two canadians. you might need a bodyguard to walk around the grounds here. are you a little worried?
is that difficult sometimes, playing players who obviously have the home crowd going for them? today maybe not as much because it was a day game, but is it tough to play or is it fun maybe to play in that energy?
can you talk about the advantage your height gives you, especially in today's match? there was a couple of chip points you were able to get to.
your height.
how is it to hear only few romanian voices encouraging you and then thousands of choices cheering for the other guy?
at one point during the second set, polansky was leading 3-1. what happened? what did you do? what did you think to reverse the whole thing?
how important was it to win that match in two sets?
you dropped serve four times in the match. are you going to attribute that to the heat? is that the main factor? is there anything else affecting your game right now?
you mentioned the heat issues. could you explain what feelings you go through when it starts to get to you? what actually happens?
is this the same problem you were having in the spring or is this something else?
what are the dangers now? like what's the worst-case scenario for you if you push yourself too far in a really hot situation?
is it almost like a game out there? you know, conserving your energy and putting it all out during the point, figuring out when to push, you know, when to pull back? explain a little bit about that.
another heat question, but is it different in various cities? like this is a very humid city, for example. do you really feel the humidity as well as the heat in a place like this?
you smashed up your racquet pretty good in the second set.
right after that, you seemed to like find the next gear and be great after that. was that just your way of blowing off steam, letting out some frustration, getting it out of your system?
how many racquets did you break this year?
good-luck charm?
i was speaking with a lot of fans after especially the doubles match, and they love your tennis. there was another reason fans also told me they were looking forward to watching your impressions of maria sharapova and other players. any chance you may be able to do it sometime this week?
back to the heat, are you working with your team on nutrition or types of fluids to drink or things to eat in between changeovers like that? are you doing anything differently there to stave off...
you broke through at this tournament in montreal in 2007 when you beat roddick and then rafa and then roger, which nobody had done i think since boris becker several years ago. you had so much fun at the time. it was i think a little bit new to you, and everything was kind of open to you. it's been now three years. you've developed the kind of the heat issue that has hindered you a little bit. you have been playing in an era where roger and rafa win most of the slams. that's a bad timing thing. is it still as fun for you, the tour, everything about it, the grind, just the whole lifestyle that comes?
with roddick dropping out of the top 10 this week, i'm wondering what you make of it, if it's a big deal or overblown. what do you make of it, in general?
i think you're the oldest american now in the top 100. do you see what's happening now is a trend or more of a blip?
some of the experts have said that they think the american field is deeper than it was even two years ago. would you agree with that?
as far as the match is concerned, you seemed to take the first set pretty handily. what adjustments did sam make that made it a lot harder to play against him in the last two?
as far as the weather for all the players, really, how difficult has it been today? it's pretty hot and muggy outside. are the conditions difficult, or are you pretty much used to playing in this weather?
what's surprised you the most about sam over this year and how high do you think he can rise potentially?
what do you think sam has really done over, you know, this past little while to really, you know, make the jump into the top 20 now?
you finally beat andy murray at the farmers classic in la. what did it mean to you to finally get that win over him?
you've beaten michael russell before usually in straight sets. today he kind of got you at the beginning. he had a 3-0 lead, and then you seemed to be getting the better of him as the match wore on. i want to know if he did anything to surprise you today, and overall, how do you feel about him at 32 really showing a persistence and having a long career?
you and russell are friends, and you seemed to be having a little bit of fun out there smiling and he threw a ball at you at one point. was it fun playing with your friend?
john mcenroe once called you america's next great talent. what does it mean to you to have that come from him and what do you draw from it?
there's no americans in the top 10 right now. you were just talking a bit about maybe the next group coming up. do you see that happening? are you feeling a little bit of a responsibility maybe to carry that flag?
what did that win over andy murray in the final do to your confidence and show you what kind of level you can compete at?
i just heard you say when you were coming in, speaking about the top 10, how everyone's kind of in a panic because andy is not in the top 10 anymore. is it almost a little annoying to hear all that buzz of people panicking when, as you said, there's four guys who are about to be in the top 20?
i think you said at the french those 250s do nothing for my ranking, and you just won la and then lost early in washington. what do you do now to start making sure that you do kind of peak for those events which do affect your ranking the most?
it seems like your serve gets most of the attention, but i'm curious from you what you think is the most underrated part of your game.
normally when a player is off due to injury for the length of time you were earlier this season, they come back and it takes them a while to get their form. how do you explain your impressive display since you've been back in july? what's your secret?
are you surprised at how well it's been going for you?
did you think at all about not playing this week because it was so tiring maybe in washington last week?
a guy like ferrer is not so easy in the first match, no?
how much do you miss having del potro on the circuit with you?
you've played ferrer 11 times. this was the 11th time. he seems to have your number on clay and you seem to have his on hardcourts. what is it about the hardcourt that, you know, you stand a better chance at beating him?
obviously davis cup is very important to you, but what are some of your personal goals or some goals you set while you were injured coming back for the season?
early in the first set i think you reached behind your back and made a shot. didn't go over the net, but how nice is it to just kind of go out there and not really worry about the injuries? and during that whole time, you just kept getting injury after injury. were you just wondering are you ever going to get healthy again or feel good on the court again?
with that in mind, the injury factor, how are you managing your schedule leading up to the davis cup? how are you thinking with, you know, sort of making sure you stay fit?
yes.
you pulled out of wimbledon for the davis cup quarterfinals. how are you sort of thinking of the us open, you know, ahead of the semifinals? is it going to be kind of a warmup?
the argentine team has been hit with so many injuries. how tough is it for you sort of having to kind of be the linchpin of the team? do you like that, or do you wish that there was a bit more support behind you this year?
how do you feel? you seemed to be a bit rusty, if i may. that's basically what you said to the announcer down there. how did it feel tonight?
obviously you mentioned the rust, but a couple of unforced errors obviously tonight. was that a case of maybe you were just trying to play aggressive or was it rust?
at the start of your career you had a small team, and you were quoted saying that my team is mirka and my parents when i first got to the top. i'm proud of that. that being said, i know you had other coaches and brought other people into the team, but with such a small team, are you ever hesitant bringing in a new person such as paul right now?
no, i mean when you started your career it was smaller. throughout your career, have you ever been hesitant bringing more people in?
you've accomplished so much over the last seven, eight years. i wonder if there is anything on your list that before you retire, whether it be another french open or equaling pete sampras for the no.1 top rankings, is there anything on your list that you think, hey, i'd like to have that before i retire?
is it strange in any way for you to come here ranked no.3, and, you know, not no.1 and not no.2? does no.3 make it any different than if, let's say, you're ranked no.2? does it make you more hungry or does it demoralize you in any way to come here as the no.3?
what, if anything, tonight did you employ that you might have spoken about with paul annacone?
maybe it's not a fair question, but...
you obviously have a chance to win many, many more slams, but if you could only win one more slam, which slam would it be?
so there's...
you've had a period of time when you've had no coach. can you say that you acted like a coach to analyze your own game?
how did you feel today?
french open semifinals and then wimbledon finals. how important are these milestones for you?
you said you need to let go of that, but so much of this game is mental and so much of this game is confidence, and that's something for you that has seemed to be so important this year. how much has this year changed you in terms of your confidence in your self-confidence in big moments, confidence against the very, very best players?
you've beaten all the top 5 except for rafa. is it still different playing him, like is there any intimidation there? i mean, because you haven't beaten him yet.
you talk about confidence and how it's so fragile. when you were out of the top 20 a couple years ago, was there ever a point where you didn't think you would be able to get back to the top 10 where you are now?
your success this year has been well documented. obviously the french and wimbledon, but at the same time you haven't won a tournament yet. how important is it for you, you know, to really consider, you know, cement the year with a tournament win?
people have been saying for a long time just how talented you are, how much natural ability you had. i imagine you're probably tired of people telling you that. talent is not something that you can just make happen or bring together like that. how nice is it, after spending a long time trying to kind of master your talent and unlock yourself, how nice is it for it to be happening, for you to be kind of finding the game that you've always wanted?
you are the fourth czech tennis player to reach the wimbledon finals. the other ones were also legends, like jaroslav drobn_, jan kodes, ivan lendl. can you tell us who were your personal tennis role models and examples?
was that the most satisfying moment for a little while for you?
what did you make of the overrule on his smash in the second set?
when at the start of a match you decide to ask him to serve first, what is the thinking behind that?
and although he had six breakpoints, didn't make any of them, how pleased were you with your level of serving and consistently, not only today but throughout this championship?
can you explain why you have such a good record against him?
you never lacked the ability to win masters series. i think you do have the ability to win grand slams. what do you think you have to do to carry your form in some of the masters series into a grand slam?
what memories will you bring back from playing in shanghai?
andy, i don't recall him getting so ratty with an umpire. he was constantly complaining, having dialogue with him. have you ever known roger to get that uptight with the officials? what goes through your mind when you're sitting at the chair and you hear him clearly being unsettled?
is this defeat more difficult to swallow because of the score: 6-3, 6-2?
you had four break chances early in the second. what do you think he did at those moments to fight you off?
could you give us your take on the overrule from the smash that didn't go long in the end and your reaction to it.
give us your take on that, how that affected you.
he's clearly got a very decent record against you in best-of-three matches. in best-of-five, you've come out on top. is there somewhat of a different mindset, not more capable, but in the ascendancy in grand slam matches rather than in best-of-three?
you're playing stockholm next, right?
i think this year your schedule has been busy for the latter part of the year. what was the reason behind adding stockholm?
have you talked with your girls yet?
when you haven't played for a little while and clearly you decide to take a bit of time off, get some practice hours under your belt, is it just the small things that go off a little bit? one could look at one or two of your forehands today and probably say, that isn't the federer forehand we've grown to know and love. is it just little things like that that you need to tighten up?
i'm from south korea. i'm surprised to see how many chinese people support you here. in terms of popularity in tennis in south korea, it's getting decreased. do you have any plans to come to south korea?
you almost did it in the first set. so what happened?
you said at your first press conference earlier this week that it was too soon to judge your season because you still had a lot of tennis to play. do you feel having a few weeks off has given you a fresher perspective going forward?
yesterday you were succinct in how you said you would modify your match to face novak with certain specifics, and you pushed it onto him today. when you face andy, is that a completely different situation?
just in terms of your approach, how you modify it.
andy was saying there are distinct similarities between the court and the pace of the surface to that at toronto, where he beat you. would you go along with that?
has anybody told you have a talent in languages?
how long did you learn the sentences?
maybe you can think of doing your speech tomorrow in chinese.
you served and volleyed a lot during the first set. you had a lot of long rallies. was that something intentional that you did?
you defeated the world no.2. now you're the world no.2. how do you feel about it?
you cooperated with paul for several months. in your opinion, what is the biggest weapon paul brings to you?
back to andy, the us open. did you see any of his match against stan, which was by his standards one of the most disappointing performances in a very long time?
level of play, approach. everything really.
stan played very well.
have you spoken to him about it at all?
also about the us open semifinal against novak, which aspect do you think you learned from that and made you win today against novak?
how do you feel and where do you think it went wrong?
how disappointed are you in the context of how you've been playing lately?
did you feel disappointed in the second set because you seemed to be hitting the ball harder, but roger was putting it back all the time?
how much of a burden was a doubles tournament for you? did you lose too much energy?
you lose the no.2 ranking to roger. what does that mean to you?
the main goal now is davis cup or...
that must have been very pleasing for you, very positive performance, full of good points.
the dropshot worked well for you today. was this part of the strategy to get him running around the court, pull him in?
you said yesterday it's easier for a player to play in the same conditions. today vastly changed from yesterday. seems your victory is much easier. how do you feel about the weather, sunshine, outdoor court?
when do you reckon you felt as good as this or played as well as this?
can you talk us through your possible future opponents.
seems that your form is getting better and better. how did you adjust it? as rafa was drawn from the match, maybe it's a better chance for you to go further?
i'm trying to think of the andy murray greatest hits album. would the federer match in the '08 tennis masters cup come right up in there?
in terms of your performances in masters events, how would that one rate today?
your performance today.
you did exactly what rafa would have liked to do. do you get a chance to talk about melzer with rafa last night? did he give you advice?
have you got any explanation about your performance during the week and the fact that you're playing very well right now?
what was the injury that kept you out for that length of time?
and murray says you know each other quite well, were in barcelona together, practiced a lot together. what is it going to be like playing him, a guy you know the way he plays? if you would have taken notes today, you would have noticed he played very well.
the atp are seeking to shorten the season to avoid players' burnout.
you participate in many tournaments. to play so good in the late stage of the season, anything to say about that?
looking at the result, that will resonate quite a lot. a scintillating performance. do you agree?
does the fact that you can play without the roof give more energy to the occasion, likes fresh air tennis should be played?
obviously the chinese fans adore you. how does that boost your confidence for tomorrow's game with djokovic?
you said you worked extremely hard in the last three weeks. what specific things did you work on? do you think it has paid off already or was it for the longer term?
quick game today. what kind of game are you expecting tomorrow against novak?
in today's baseline rallies you hit the balls short which made your opponent make lots of mistakes. did you do it on purpose or is it something paul annacone told you to do?
you mentioned tactical things with novak for the match for tomorrow. you played so many times together. is there something new to try to do?
at the end of another long season there's been a lot of talk about the short off-season. i'm wondering if you think there's a concerted effort now to address this and whether there could be a longer off-season in a couple years if it's approved by the atp board at the end of november?
you have stayed in shanghai for a week. you must miss your wife and daughters very much. how do you connect with them? some interesting things happen to your daughters during this period?
novak played doubles here in shanghai. do you think that is going to be an advantage physically?
he lost today.
you've only dropped 13 games in three matches. obviously striking the ball well. how did you feel out there today? what do you think about the next match, possibly playing federer?
was there a moment post wimbledon when suddenly things began to click into place for you? was there a match that you felt suddenly your form had taken a great turn for the better?
you probably will have three matches in one day. do you remember the last time when you were so busy? has it happened before?
why did you play doubles? at this time of the year everyone is saying, i'm tired, i played enough.
why doubles at this tournament?
you've been playing really well last couple of weeks. it's late in the season. looks like you don't have any problem with your energy level, the physical part. i think you matured a lot in the past few years, especially the physical parts. what comments would you make regarding that?
melzer hit 37 winners against you and you're a very big defender. that's a surprise, you cannot defend.
after playing three straight weeks, the final on sunday, do you think that had anything to do with today, your performance?
after the us open, people think you might need a longer rest. you came back to play quickly, three tournaments in a row. why did you decide to play three tournaments in a row?
are you surprised by how the fatigue affected you today? did you feel it before or did it hit you suddenly after the first set perhaps?
what do you think of the influence of the audience? it seems too loud in the stadium?
you said you want to do better at london o2 this year than you did last year. obviously, wimbledon and queen's has always been a happy place for you. did you like the tournament last year? do you think it was well-organized? what are your thoughts about going to london this year?
really?
you gave a very good answer the other day about the calendar. without going all the way back again, i just wondered if you had any response from anybody in the game about what you'd said here a couple of days ago?
we all know that you promote your serving during the us open and that helps you win the grand slam title. your serve is not as powerful as before. is there something wrong with your serving? you didn't take training today. can you explain something about this?
this afternoon.
are you relieved or just pleased to get through to london after that win?
when does it start to become a priority in a top player's mind? is it once the us open is out of the way that you sort of start doing your sums, i need points here, points there?
it's not something that enters the minds of the top four or five until new york is done, is it? do you sit there thinking in march, what do i have to do to get to london, or...
in the beginning of the match your opponent got three breakpoints, but you adjusted yourself as soon as possible. how did you do it?
i noticed your first-serve percentage is just 53%, even lower than chardy's 68%. what do you think about that? is it normal? if not, what's the reason?
the weather actually turned an outdoor hard court into an indoor tournament. do you feel anything strange or you just feel more comfortable under the roof?
every possibility you might play tsonga in the next round. wondered what your thoughts are about that.
who was on the court today, roger's twin or roger himself?
you know better than me.
are you happy with your game today?
today's match tells us more about how you're playing right now. there were more rallies. yesterday is more about serve and return. what would you say about your play right now and your energy level compared to us open?
next up, robin soderling, familiar opponent to you. what are you expecting he'll bring? how difficult of a match do you think it will be?
you must have received a lot of gifts from your chinese fans. could you tell us some impressive gifts chinese fans have given you.
today many people read the news online the boss of your company has been sued by someone because of his scandal in football lotteries. in the french open in 2008, you played with rafael nadal. some said you provided some information to him before the match. would you like to clarify this or would you like to give your fans some guarantee?
just to ask you what you think about the defeat of rafa, is it a huge surprise for you?
i heard you like listening to lady gaga songs on the way to the stadium. is that true?
if you like listening to her songs, i was wondering the reason she has a song named love game?
richard gasquet said he was exhausted by the two matches of yesterday. maybe it was a little bit easier for you today?
are you feeling more and more confident that this could be back-to-back titles two weeks in a row?
your last two matches were played under the roof. it's quite different from beijing. do you feel anything strange or do you feel more comfortable playing indoors instead of outdoors?
five days before you were the champion in beijing. do you want another one here?
in china you have many young girlfriends, including my girlfriend.
what do you think about the fans in china?
we are interested about the dragon on your sports suit. in china, dragon means power. to you, what's the meaning of this dragon?
you know that there has been a very bad incident provoked by soccer, serbian fans in a game. what do you think about that? is there a risk one of those guys could make trouble in the davis cup final?
if you rank your game on each kind of surface, can we say that playing indoors suits your game better?
do you remember the conversation about the beard in beijing? that's why you didn't shave your beard here in shanghai?
we didn't see the match, so could you talk about the match for us a little bit? also before the match, when you knew who your opponent was, what did you do in your preparation and what did you learn from the match?
last week in beijing in the china open, there was the coaches summit. li na's coach spoke highly of you, said your game is like novak's. anything that you want to develop in your game?
for the male players in china, your ranking is not as good as the female rankings. do you have any difficulties in trying to improve your rankings?
if there is one star player out of the chinese team, it will motivate the other players. is there any possibility that we are going to see a star from your generation?
your next big match is the asian games. any expectations for the asian games? what is the overall level of the chinese team? who are your major opponents?
i remember when we interviewed li na in the china open, she said that chinese young players have a unique psychology when they play with the top players in the world. to play several good games will make them very satisfied if not complacent so they cannot complete the whole game winning. do you also have the same psychology?
does it mean you don't know how to win?
today you played with a chinese player. he also made some big achievements. any differences or gaps between the two of you?
a follow-up question. compared to lu, maybe you are not as experienced as he is and your tactics are not as good. but technically do you think you are pretty similar? do you think you can be as good as him when you have more experience?
something about october 13th in shanghai?
i know it's still kind of early, but what's the prognosis on this one?
you said you first noticed this in last week's tournament.
can you explain what happened today on the shot, looked like you may have slipped with your foot, and did that cause it?
i read last year in the week before the injury that you complained about the schedule. has that been a factor, as well?
where specifically on the leg is it injured?
is that something that could require surgery?
what will it take for rehabilitation?
what is your next plan? will you have a rest and come back in paris?
you're not an old player, but do you also look at it and say, do i start to alter the way i approach training, or do you write it off as a bad year?
was this a difficult match today? he was hitting a lot of big shots, winners and aces. what was it like out there for you today. was this a hard match?
as the year is winding down and obviously you've played a lot of tennis, how difficult is it to maintain your composure when you have to do press conferences and commitments? how do you manage to maintain your focus and keep your energy?
andy murray just said he thought he and his partner won the game last night against you and your partner. i want to hear the story from your side. who won?
maybe i should ask what you thought of your young chinese opponent today. i'm sure a lot of people would be delighted to know what you thought of him, his prospects maybe.
as you said, it seems like you know your opponent a lot. what are his advantages and disadvantages?
is it sometimes difficult playing someone you don't know very well or at all, who is ranked so low?
i think you know your opponent well enough and his injuries. could you tell us, have you watched his first match against stepanek?
from your perspective, what pleased you most about today's performance?
how did you feel out there physically? you said you were sick before beijing.
who won yesterday evening, monaco and you or nadal and your partner?
you're not blaming your partner?
you showed the present the fans gave you in beijing.
is there any other very impressive present that chinese fans give you?
can you talk about your energy level out there today. you looked fresh, running down dropshots, hitting shots between your legs. did the four weeks off after the open help get you to this point?
can you look ahead to the next round. you said you're feeling fairly well. you have to be pretty confident?
off topic. it's said you might be learning mandarin. is this true? taking a few mandarin lessons?
no.
what might be the reason for this?
this was a private lesson?
(indiscernible.)
how do you feel about doing it again, the shot between your legs? also, how do you feel about the reaction from the audience tonight?
you went to expo. could you share your experience, your impression.
back to that shot you made. did you do it intentionally or spontaneously?
i heard you've been practicing with some chinese young players.
can you give an assessment of their play? is there any advice you can give them to make the next progress?
how old are they?
i guess we'll have to congratulate your sister.
looks like your family has a tradition of having twins. i begin to think you and your sister are twins at the beginning.
i wanted to ask if there's any fatigue today coming off the victory monday in beijing?
it seemed like you didn't have too many problems out there today. what was the problem in closing out the first set? was he playing particularly good defense?
talk about the challenge. ivan made the ball outside the line, but the judge called it in. what do you think about that? do you think it was out or on the line?
last year for beijing china open and shanghai masters you played eight matches in 11 days. you said you felt exhausted after that. how do you feel after your first match here in shanghai physically and mentally?
you arrived here late. now you finished your match first out of the top four players. are you happy to have an early win today?
why do you choose to play doubles matches here in shanghai? is it preparation for davis cup?
last week in beijing you spoke highly about one of the youngsters who practiced with you. how do you think about the chinese male youngsters performance here?
obviously a davis cup semifinal win is a great victory for your country. you played davis cup one match after the us open. of course you were very tired. can you talk through the davis cup semifinal for us now, your experience with your team.
it's always tough when you are the defending champion to lose in the first round. what went wrong today?
how many tournaments do you have to play now?
did you know much about your opponent today? have you played before?
what do you think of the influence of the rain, revised schedule?
what's your feeling about this season? is it a disappointment or something?
what do you think not making to london the end of this year?
briefly, how do you think you played today? how good did it feel to have a relatively easy match in the end?
would it be fair to say that london is a big ambition of yours this year? how are you feeling at the moment?
at the moment you're playing here, somewhere else, then paris, or just here and paris?
how important is it to get back into the top 10 by the end of the year? you finished in the top 10 the last nine seasons. is that a goal of yours?
some players feel the pressure about their world ranking. they play as many tournaments as they can. maybe the more they play, they lose more, and their physical condition is poor after playing so many tournaments. what is your opinion about that?
some news said if you're ranked lower than top 15, you will retire. is that true?
back to london. are you the kind of person that knows exactly what you have to do, you follow it? some players talk about worrying about the next match. do you zone in on that stuff?
i'm deeply impressed about your strong, powerful serve which gives your opponents great pressure. a lot of people say that is your only advantage. do you admit that?
what is the greatest target before you retire? have you ever changed your target?
you won the match, but also you lost on the ace numbers. can you explain why is that?
his ranking his 400 and something. was it surprising the way he played?
you gave an unexpected performance today, right?
can you be more specific?
what is it part you're most satisfied with in today's performance?
can you continue with such a performance?
your next rival is mr. murray. he talked about he will fight against stepanek, and he never thought about you, i think. do you have any strategy against him?
can you give us a little bit of a history of your tennis and how you have arrived at the point where you are, please?
the surgeries were on what exactly? what required the surgery? what was the injury?
can you tell us what you think of playing andy murray in such a big tournament in your home country?
how many matches do you play each year?
do you think by going into these matches, these tournaments, you can be better off? how many matches have you played this year?
do they help a lot in terms of improving your strategies and techniques? do you have opportunities to compete overseas from the chinese national team? do they give you such opportunities to play overseas?
you said you've been playing tennis for some years. can you be specific about what age you started? can you also tell us who you're heroes and idols were when you started playing the game?
you talk about many talented players. can you tell us a bit about your style?
i guess that was the biggest win of your career today. could you tell us what it felt like and could you say what you think the strong parts of your game are?
we have written quite a lot about the success of women players from china, but not so much about the male players. is there some significance to being the most successful of the chinese male players? is that something that you'd like to be yourself? perhaps you are already.
about going for the grand slam matches next year, have you ever thought about playing a singles grand slam yourself?
before you came to the masters, you played in the futures. you won the wild card. do you think this is your best form at the moment? how do you think about the matches in qualifying?
you played two matches. do you think now you're in your best form?
have you ever watched andy murray playing any matches on television? did you watch him at the us open or wimbledon? what are your thoughts on him as a player?
do you have any comment on the two matches in the china open and in the shanghai masters? it's a pity in the two matches you had chances, but unfortunately you failed. so what do you learn from the two matches?
recently we heard you have been on a diet. is it true?
i want to ask you, you changed from the teenage to the adult game. for you, what's the difference? what is your feeling?
i want to ask, after the shanghai tournament, what is your schedule? will you go for the asian games? will you have intensive training? what games will you play?
just now you said that larry brings you a lot of changes. can you be more specific, the physical strength in terms of mental conditions? can you talk more about the changes that larry brings to you?
you have a lot of fans, both in beijing and shanghai. some came specifically to shanghai to give you support. they really want to hear from you. do you have any message for them?
now you start playing the adult games and have done quite well. you look handsome. you're good-looking for the girls. do you want to be an idol player? how do you feel about this?
you gave a strong performance in terms of your serving. what do you think about that? was it a normal performance for you or 70 or 80 percent of a performance?
returning from the injury, did that affect your confidence at all coming into this match? did it take some time getting over any nervousness at the beginning in the first set?
the last time you came to shanghai was two years ago. in some chinese news, it said you don't like chinese banana. is that true?
chinese banana.
which is your favorite chinese food?
back to the layoff from tennis.
is there any specific area of your game that you felt you needed to work on more than anything else coming back, your serve or anything?
do the french fans give you power?
andy, nice going.
you were playing a fine player today.
and he doesn't even have one breakpoint.
everyone talks about your big bomb first serve. are you proud of the fact that you got like four pitches: the change of pace, the curve, the kick. did that help you out there today as well?
he seemed to be having trouble finding a rhythm because of what you were doing, and then he lines up on the wrong side to serve. what was your reaction to that?
do you think there's any connection there? do you make anything of it that he's trying to figure out...
not usually in the first set of a final, though.
what does this title mean to you in the grand scheme of your career? what does it mean?
could you talk a little bit perhaps about the maturing that you've undergone?
it's fairly commendable, though.
larry's input has helped you enormously. you can see by the way you play and react to things that you clearly have undergone a maturing process.
you grew up here 50 miles away. you said on the court, wildcard from butch; beat pete; federer; two titles. just talk about the special connection you've had here.
you hadn't won a masters series event since 2006. did you ever doubt you could win another one, and is this a big relief for you?
you've had an impressive list of coaches. talk about what larry has brought to the table that's different. i've know him for years. he's somebody who really likes to be in charge of the situation.
considering how well you've been playing the last month, how much are you looking forward to the summer?
not looking too far ahead, but you said there was a time when you felt maybe the best was in the past. do you feel with the way you're playing now and with guys having success in their late 20s, early 30s that maybe the best is yet to come at this point?
do you feel you played two different matches against nadal and berdych?
up at the net a lot and only three times serve and volley in this match today.
gordon hayward was happy to hear from you. what prompted that phone call?
who are you picking?
given the in past year you've been known for your many achievements outside of tennis, do you feel that maybe the fates were with you, that you also won because today is easter sunday and we're in the middle of passover?
how do you go into the clay court season? are you looking for the titles? i mean, obviously it's not your favorite surface.
can you just pinpoint a couple things you think you're doing better on the court now that you changed, or are you just playing more effectively?
does connors get a little credit on the backhand?
obviously you've got to be proud for your results this week. the difference today, was it just andy playing pretty clean tennis, and when he has to serve he makes it every time?
how about the second serve. it's almost as formidable as the first serve as far as statistically. you didn't do much damage on the second serve; is that a problem?
seemed like you're first serve of also off.
the 11th game of the first set, the double fault on the drop serve. was it a case of nerves, or what happened just then?
it seems like on the first break chance that he had in the first set, the first breakpoint, you made an error on the first serve and then the clap from the crowd. was that a distraction also for you?
if you look at the week as a whole with the win over roger and some other good performances, you must be satisfied?
i noticed the other day when i mentioned ivan lendl's name you didn't perk up. do you find any comparisons to him? early in his career he didn't do so well in big matches - grand slam finals - and then he broke through. do you feel any comparison or parallel to him at all?
did you say what the difference between you two guys was? it was so small.
i don't know if you were asked this either, did he play any different or better than the other times that you've played him? do you feel that he's playing better now or that he played you any different than he had in previous times?
you played him years ago and won the first few times, five, six, seven years ago. do you feel he's changed a lot over the years, his style of play?
what would you say the keys to beating andy are? you played him three times this year so far. what would you do differently or what could somebody do to beat him?
what do you think made the difference out there in today's match?
did you expect him to play serve and volley so much on his second serve?
now when you look back, what would you do? would you do something different?
did you feel the match turned a little bit in the second set when he got the break after the defensive lob and then offensive lob? did you feel the momentum switch there?
did you feel your forehand was a little bit off as the match went on?
are you happy to be getting back on the clay?
yeah, but you've talked about how the clay is better for your body i meant more.
is it harder or easier to go and play against a guy who you know is always gonna put you under pressure and is a very good competitor? does that make you mentally sharper, or is there a fear factor?
did he play any differently than the matches before? did you notice anything different, or was he the same andy?
do you feel like you're getting closer and closer to winning a tournament again?
have you been working on anything specifically during this hardcourt season that you want to improve in your game?
is andy one of the better thinkers that you play against, rafa? obviously you dominated the first set with the forehand. he seemed to be more aggressive with his forehand and return of serve. is he a good thinker out there?
you're very well-known for your fighting ability. people admire and love that about you. then you have this break and some issues and problems. are you completely back in terms of how your spirit feels going out to play the matches, the hunger to win matches? are you completely back now?
you must be very proud to be in the final since lendl in 1999.
the last two times you met robin, one was in sunrise in a challenger series here, and kuala lumpur. he pretty much beat you handily. how did you change your game plan or tactics today?
i guess the last czech in the final here was ivan lendl. how had much contact with him over the years? is he someone you admired growing up?
twice.
you've had quite a week. what's been the secret? what's been happening out there for you?
the entire tournament. what's been the reason for your success?
you an andy, andy's 5-2 against you. he beat you like the last three times. what do you expect? power game. not gonna see a lot of finesse and chips, are you?
you played two pretty tough matches this week: three hours against federer and almost three hours against verdasco. do you think that's gonna be a factor in the final on sunday? andy's obviously much fresher than you are.
do you feel like your success lately has been due to your mental attitude, that it's been more positive than in the past?
go to any panther's games this week? i know you're a big hockey fan.
you were at the very high level already in 2005. why you not being so great in rankings, because you deserve far better, as we can see? what makes you be a good top 20 and not very good top 10?
did you feel at the moment you're close to breaking into that top 8 group?
have you had any chance to text anyone or call anyone at home?
basically a great turnaround, wasn't it?
did you feel like at the start of the third when he started to really whack the ball that he was losing his control a bit? did you feel, right, just keep it steady and i've got him here?
you seemed to be in very-confident mode throughout even in the first set when things weren't going your way. as well as the tiredness, did you bring that confidence through from the great victory earlier in the week?
last question. you've obviously got the next game to think about. you must be feeling confident that you can go all the way in this tournament.
who do you prefer to face next, robin or...
you have been playing two very hard matches, hard-fought. do you have enough for the next one?
looking forward to the davis cup tie, facing chile next time?
how hard is it to focus on the match after a big win like beating federer?
how important is your serve to win these kinds of matches that are too long?
just ten unforced errors. are you surprised when you hear such a low number?
were you especially pleased the way you rallied and weren't tempted to go for winners as early in the rally as perhaps in days and years gone by you might have been tempted to?
it looked like he had some trouble returning your serves at times. did it feel better today?
any preference for the next round?
yeah, players.
were you watching tennis at 12:15 this morning, by chance?
what was your reaction to roger's loss?
i know you said that you weren't particularly pleased with the way you played or the results in memphis and the other event you played this year. but in terms of this hardcourt swing, how much in tune with your game do you feel at the moment, and what good of level have you reached in the last three weeks or so?
south florida is a hotbed for youth tennis. you received some instruction here as well. can you talk about why this environment helps breed that so much?
do you still have the feeling this is home tournament for you, or not so much anymore?
i assume you still have a house in boca. how much time are you in texas, and i know you have the place in new york.
what sort of influence do you think you then have on america youth tennis?
yeah.
does billie jean travel with you is one question, and then tradition says that paper is the first anniversary gift.
you're not gonna get away with that, are you?
yes. i can tell you that.
oh, yes. i'm helping you out.
stationary is pretty reasonable.
paper. you know, paper.
billie jean travel with you?
does she fit underneath when you're on a...
it's working?
safe to say that sixth game was the turnaround?
you were playing it that way.
when you pull that game out, that's a big psychological swing.
then 4-5, love-30, bringing out the heavy artillery. just nice to have at you disposal; 135s came out.
what did happen at the beginning of the match? why did you get that far down, do you think?
what's the difference between the surface here and indian wells, both surface and even playing conditions, atmospheric conditions?
do you think years ago, five, six years ago, you would have played down love-30 or when you were down 4-1 you would have played any different? is there something about being more mature and playing more tennis that helps you come back like that?
aren't you more of a thinker now, andy? you always had game.
mardy said he thinks the weight you lost whenever it was, last summer, that that made a big difference. do you feel that still?
since you got here, you've played doubles with fred...
you've been involved in the chilean earthquake thing.
horse with d-wade. a lot of top players are so reluctant to stray from the structure of their schedule. has your approach to that changed over the years? what's your approach? how do you feel about it?
speaking of big causes, last night people were saying if there's anybody that isn't jewish that you want to root for, it's andy roddick. that's going back to what you did for shahar peer last year pulling out of dubai. have a lot of people come to you since then saying, we always liked you, but congratulations for taking a stand?
tell me how you've developed your game. is your attitude about clay any different these days? what actually are your plans?
have you watched nadal and federer play at all this week? what do you think about how they're playing?
speaking of clay, i guess if you're gonna play almagro you want it on a hardcourt. talk about the matchup.
do you have a preference, to have a match like this, being tested in a longer match as opposed to having a quick match in the earlier rounds?
obviously quite a few players have fallen by the wayside, djokovic and murray. can you talk about how hard it is to come out, even for the top guys, and repeat week after week?
there were maybe a few patchy moments, but you also hit a few shots for the highlight shows. i'm wondering how often do you hit a shot that surprises even you at this point in your career?
were you surprised being down a double break that he was still mentally pretty strong and still fighting?
were you unhappy? like when you were serving for the set and then serving for the match and you lost your serve, were you unhappy or frustrated?
i don't know if you've been asked this since australia, but you've got your family here; your children now probably about nine months i think.
how is that sort of challenge evolving of fitting your tennis around having a family with you as they get a bit older?
what is the most important thing for you as a tennis player: to win a grand slam? to be no.1? to win davis cup? or to win medal in the olympics?
yeah.
are you missing playing rafa? because it's like one year that you and he played.
play against him...
here maybe?
he was out actually watching the match earlier on. do you ever go out and watch his matches?
the day started out rather miserably with lots of rain. could you tell us how you spent that time and how you weren't supposed to come out until the second match, but...
what was more fun, almost beating wade in horse or tonight?
you were definitely better at basketball than he was at tennis, right?
you were looking forward that. were you nervous at all really?
larry said you guys play basketball in austin now and then.
man, he could shoot.
so this match tonight was quick. i guess that's how you wanted it?
rafa almost went down today. that would really open up that side, i guess.
you've got a match against becker; you've done well against him. he's tough from the baseline, obviously.
when you see an opponent slam his racquet down like that and start jawing with the crowd, does that signal to you that you've beaten him pretty much at that point?
you had to play some of your very best tennis today to beat david. were you surprised how well he played?
what makes him so good? he's beaten roger eight times. is it the backhand? just the whole package?
with murray and djokovic out, you have a big chance to gain ranking points on them. do you think about that at all in this tournament?
but the best players are expected to maintain such a great level all the time, and when they don't reach that level, people are surprised. how difficult is it to keep that level for the whole time?
i know you never like to look ahead, but you realize the tournament would love to see you against roger in the final; the fans would love to see it. do you care who you see in the final as long as you're there?
you'll play david ferrer, another friend, i'm sure.
tough out, right?
you know this court almost more than anyone else. you practice here all the time. what made the difference in today's match?
any particular reason? did you feel good or the forehand went out of sync?
it looked pretty fine, 3-1, 40-love, you were in relative control. just something happen there.
were you surprised how aggressive he was on that return?
you've had success with him before. how much do you think maybe this fitness thing he went through has given him a little extra speed or confidence?
is this all the more baffling, given a city and a place you're so familiar with and you're comfortable with?
do you think a change of surface, especially on the clay, might actually be what you need now, a switch of direction?
any reason why it goes away? i mean, is it frustrating?
obviously one of your best wins of your career. seems to me you're in good form. your serve, whenever you wanted it, you called on it, and it was there.
did you sense he was not feeling the ball out there, or was it you just applying pressure?
you look like a different person. i haven't seen you in a while. it's very obvious that you're a lot leaner. did you get to a point ever where there was sort of a strength-to-weight ratio that you had to pay attention to in trying to drop weight?
was there some cathartic moment where you decided you had to do this? something that happened that...
you said that you were still learning to use your newfound quickness. about how quickly could you get to balls that maybe you couldn't get to before at all? do you feel like now you're figuring that out, figuring out what you're capable of?
what's this do for confidence? like you said, from here on out, you beat the no.3 player in the world.
will you give yourself a celebratory cold one tonight?
was there a point in the match where you sensed that you were frustrating him, any particular point?
do you ever look at the opposition and look at their body language think, i have a good chance?
your return seemed to be particularly in your favor today in helping you out. can you talk about that?
did rochus' win yesterday over djokovic give you inspiration? and talk about lopez who you have up next.
do you regret you couldn't have been this disciplined earlier in your career?
is this home court for you?
is there pressure of having lots of friends and more family maybe than you do elsewhere?
just to follow-up, what does it mean to you to be playing down here in miami?
the way roddick almost won in horse, last letter, he said he carried you at boca prep.
tell us the truth.
oh, awful. andy played much better in basketball.
when you woke up this morning, did you have a feeling that today was going to be your day?
i've seen you played very well, but do you think you've ever played better than that over three sets?
how tough was it going into the third set after losing the tiebreak? what did you tell yourself? how did you prepare yourself mentally going into the third?
did you think that second set, 3-2, you got a forehand pass down the line for 4-2 and you missed it like that much, and then it helped him win the second. do you think it was over at that point?
do you think experience got you through today, the fact of you being on the tour a long time you know about big matches?
you're out there basically with the rain delays like seven hours. i don't know if the conditions seemed slow, the ball seemed slow. did it feel like a clay court match out there a little bit?
how satisfying was that match today against djokovic? i mean, i don't want to say it looked easy, but your game was really solid in every aspect.
how do you take a win like that and kind of keep the string going? i mean, how do you sustain...
was there any point in your career when you thought that maybe you weren't tall enough, or did anyone ever say to you that with all the big tall players coming along that maybe you wouldn't be able to succeed? how did you deal with that?
from the first shot it looked like you really brought it to him. did you and your team prepare by watching like videos or anything else?
you just had your game plan?
some of the points were really long. how tired are you right now, and what will you do to recover for the next match?
did you notice anything different from novak? his serve didn't seem as penetrating. he's pushing his backhand. did you notice anything, like a shake of confidence in him at all?
obviously a good start. nice tidy win. your serve wasn't broken. is that how you drew it up, how planned?
djokovic lost. is it advantageous to you when a player like djokovic is out of the draw?
the other night, on tuesday, you were practicing around 8:00 in the evening. i saw you hit purposely a lot of balls went like way out. was there anything in particular you were training on, or...
(in spanish.) you actually broke two strings twice. was there anything in particular? you were hitting really hard.
getting your range?
the other day you said you were having problems with your tooth. how is it? have you seen any dentist since?
are you gonna get it pulled after the tournament?
were you having problems breathing on the court? looked like the conditions were a little bit heavy out there.
why do you think it's always so tough when you play him?
why do you think it's always tough when you play him?
obviously it's a tough out for anybody, but do you feel like since serbia something's missing, your serve, your offense, something, confidence?
your return is such a strong part of your game. today was it you just weren't executing a return, or was his second serve better than what...
are the conditions slower than usual? it seemed like the rallies just weren't as fast.
what made him such a tough competitor today for you?
considering you didn't bring your a game, you were still in there.
did the rain delays affect you in any way, first at the start, and then mid-match?
what do you think it says about men's tennis that the no.2 seed can have such a difficult time in his opening match?
i mean, that first set it just seemed like you weren't -- there was something missing there. did you feel from the start there was something wrong, or...
there were some jeers when you were coming off the court, which surprised us up in the media area. were you are scratching your head? any idea what that's about?
your serve is one of your weapons. is there something technically wrong with it since maybe...
you've been playing a lot of tennis. are you thinking of maybe rescheduling for the clay season?
i apologize for the timing, but since you're on the player council, your reaction to the news about wayne odesnik?
so what would you say about that kid? he's only 18.
does he remind you of anybody, just the way he plays?
how are you feeling in general?
i know the clay court schedule is always kind of a dilemma for you. it's looking a bit ahead, but i'm curious about your thinking. are you gonna spend a lot of time over there this spring?
there's been an article or two that suggested that there was unofficial boycott of davis cup by a number of players who have been fairly loyal to it. do you think that's true, or just for a variety of reasons a lot of players just weren't able to step up?
is isner one of those guys that kind of has surprised you in those prediction things or not?
you're participating in that exhibition in atlantic city next month.
ivan lendl is gonna come back for the first time since he retired.
have you met him? are you looking forward to seeing him play? even though it's just...
mats was talking in del rey actually about how you guys don't have maybe as easy or whatever -- maybe the reason why there's more injuries today is because in his era you could kind of sit back and kind of cruise in some matches, and that's not available to the players today. they have to play 100% all the time.
rafa said in the interview on court after the match, he said that he thought perhaps you might have demonstrated that you were a bit tired, and maybe it was a result of the difficult match that you had to get to your quarterfinal match. would you agree?
what were the conditions like out there?
you've played nadal a few times. do you think he's playing better than you've ever seen him play?
more specifically, how do you think his serve is better? i didn't hear the other thing that you said was better. can you explain a little bit more, please?
in terms of defense to offense, is there any better player in tennis than rafa?
you've come close twice now to getting to grand slam finals. what do you think you need to do different to sort of take that next step?
overall were you pretty happy with the last couple of weeks?
first of all, if you can elaborate on that a bit. i mean, you know, i guess it takes a little time to look back and reflect and say, hey, i got to the semifinals of a grand slam. but is it almost that much more difficult? because you were playing such good tennis coming in, and, you know, you start to think about maybe i can be a finalist here? or can you look back and say, this was a great two weeks for me; i've played some great tennis?
do you feel in a way today you might have beaten yourself as opposed to rafa beating you? is there a bit of that?
i think you said in your last press conference that you're hoping to be the bad guy.
you were hoping to be the bad guy or the bad person. that didn't happen.
do you think you have to play your absolute best tennis against rafa? is he in that kind of form, that that's the only way you can beat him? generally, not just you.
what do you think overall are the one or two things that make him so tough, that make him the no.1 player? what are his greatest strengths?
so if final against federer and nadal, which one you think?
the atmosphere out there was quite electric today. i mean, you know, it's the final weekend of the us open; it generally is. but particularly when you broke back at 4-4 in the third, you really seemed to be able to pump yourself up, and the crowd was clearly with you at that point.
did you feel that? can you talk about your mindset at that particular moment and the atmosphere in general?
was there a moment when you thought you might be able to turn things around?
i saw you had a black ribbon on your t-shirt today. was that to mark today's events, or was that the reason?
what does it mean to you to get to the finals of the us open?
i was wondering, with having to come back tomorrow, how important was it to get it over in three sets?
we don't know who's gonna get through here; roger took the first set. should he get through, people are saying this may just be the most important final in the open era, if not in tennis history. i'm wondering what your thoughts are on that.
if it is roger tomorrow against you, given your head-to-head record against him and the possibility of winning the career grand slam, earlier in the tournament you said, roger is the greatest player ever in your mind. do you feel as though you'll be on the path to be called the greatest player ever?
we know that you don't like to look too far ahead, either in matches or in tournaments, but did you have a special feeling about this open in the past few months for any reason because of the issues, the career slam possibly, that sort of thing?
respectfully, in our sport, people love to talk about who is the greatest player of all time. in that conversation, do you think it should be based strictly on number of grand slams won, or do you feel there are other elements in it such as head-to-head?
do you think davis cup or olympics or masters series should be a consideration in the conversation?
you said a moment ago that you thought roger was playing the best tennis right now, of the year. quite a few players in this press room in the last week have said that they think that he's playing the best tennis of his career. how much have you watched of his matches? would you assess it as maybe the best of his career?
roger said before the tournament began that he wanted to face you in the finals. how do you feel right now at this moment with that match going on and you're already there?
the way you play and the way you move on the court, it's like you were in 2003, 2004. do you think tomorrow will be easy if you play against djokovic?
the first part is just a commentary. the way you move on the court now, the way you were moving is like you were moving in 2003, 2004.
yes. so do you think tomorrow will be easy match for you?
if you face novak djokovic, tell me about that match, what you think of nole.
if you do face roger, how different would it be tactically than facing him on the other surfaces where you've already played him?
what, if anything, do you remember about the way juan martin del potro beat roger here last year in the final? if roger is your opponent, is it possible for you to learn anything tactically from del potro's approach, or does that have no significance to the way you would play roger here?
when you were a little boy, which players did you most enjoy watching?
when you were on the court earlier, you acknowledged 9/11 and you talked about new york and how you felt embraced by the city. what prompted you to make those comments, and how has new york made you feel welcome?
your serve, i mean, how much work have you put into the serve and how much has it made a change for you, the little changes that you made?
when athletes win consistently and they reach the level you have, no.1, they're very stubborn. they don't want to change anything. why are you able to adapt and change things in your game even at the level you've reached?
you've always been extremely hungry. you could have been the king of clay only, and you worked and worked to win wimbledon. you could have done just that, and you worked and worked to do what you're doing on hard court. does that hunger come from, i want to win everywhere, or is it just, i want to be the best i can be? why is it you're always not satisfied?
first of all. that was an absolutely remarkable match.
you should be extremely proud of yourself. i imagine you are. the emotions on the court after the match, can you just talk about that moment and reflect?
do you have any gas in the tank?
no one's ever gonna forget your victory in the australian open, but do you think this match today, the way you played, is almost as important to you as winning a grand slam?
you say you're exhausted. how tired are you?
you were beaten by roger the last three years, semis and finals. what did you learn from those matches that you applied tonight?
the crowd seemed to bother you a bit i think in the third set when you were serving 5-6. how difficult was it to concentrate, keep your focus?
can you just walk us through what you think you'll do for the next few hours? i mean, do you have massage, ice bath, food?
no, but seriously, i mean, is it your don't want to talk about it because you don't want to give away your training secrets or...
you mentioned that federer is the greatest player ever. nadal is going also for a career grand slam. he's younger than federer. he has a better head-to-head record than federer. in your mind, what are the chances that some day nadal will be the greatest player ever?
follow-up on the question about atmosphere here. how hard is it when people are screaming between the points and also after you missed your first serve?
how do you think it will be tomorrow playing against nadal on that subject?
rain in the forecast for tomorrow.
do you think that's gonna help you?
were you surprised to see federer losing the sets two and four so easily?
late in the fifth you're facing match points; you're at the edge. once again you survive and manage to go on. take us through that game? and then did that somehow give you some kind of momentum or confidence deep into...
you say that federer is the best player ever, greatest player ever. i'd like to know what do you think about the fact that he lost match points many times with safin in australia, with gasquet in monte-carlo, with nadal in rome, with you today, with berdych.
no. i just want to know if you think that he's playing a little too safe --
-- in those moments?
you won over the crowd clearly by the end of the performance.
you're going against the greatest player and against your own record with roger here. is there any way that you're sort of fighting also this feeling from the crowd and everyone wanting rafa and fed in the final? was that an extra opponent for you today? did you have to fight against that?
after you saved those two match points, you hit your heart with your racquet. is that the best you've ever played when match point down?
what's the difference between the novak djokovic of the wimbledon semifinal and the one today?
your coach couldn't be here. strangely, a lot of players have won tournaments without coach. does it change anything for you, the state of mind on the court not having a coach watching you from the stands?
can you describe the combination of facing roger federer in the semifinal and then rafa nadal in the final and what winning those two matches would signify to you?
in all your head-to-head with nadal, you're down 14 to 7, but all your 7 wins came on hard courts. do you consider yourself normally favorite when you play nadal on hard court if you are more tired? is this going to be the first final for the barbadillo giorgio di palermo company?
roger obviously has the 16 slams and 23 straight semis, and is widely accepted as the best of all time. yet rafa has a 14-7 record, great wins in finals, and great wins recently. where do you think the head-to-head rivalry plays into the discussion of who is the greatest of all time?
when you were asked earlier about rafa possibly becoming the greatest ever, and spoke quite reverently about his accomplishments and so forth. it's occurring to me that at 23 years of age, you yourself are somebody that -- there's a lot of great championships to be played. with a victory tomorrow, your name belongs in there, you know, in this conversation about roger and rafa. roger himself said in the press conference that people that overlook you just don't know that much about tennis. your thoughts on sort of all these questions.
it's true. but you're not 28, 29, you know, in the twilight of your career. you're 23. there's still so much tennis to be played.
so you lost the first set, and then you both held serve, 6-all in the second. can you tell me what happened in that tiebreaker? what did you figure out? how did it help you later in the match?
how did you figure out how to beat him? was there a moment? was there a moment that occurred that you can point to where you said, i think i know how to take him out?
can you talk about just your overall impression of the match. it was a long, hard battle out there. momentum was shifting back and forth. it could have gone any which way, and yet you prevailed under very difficult conditions.
after a tough match like that, how do you feel? does anything hurt or are you okay?
what is it like to reach that stage of the tournament?
you've been on the semifinals stage before here once. it was four years ago.
talk about whether or not you can draw upon that experience to perhaps help you in what's likely to be a very, very difficult match in the next round.
but to have been here on that stage before, yes, it was four years ago, but you have been here before.
that leads to what i was trying to get at. he had a bandage on his left knee out there, and he had mentioned that he had suffered some trouble in his match against murray and he didn't know how it would be. when you were out there and it was a tough contest, were you just running as fast as you could and hitting every shot to stay in the match, or were you really trying to attack a part of his game specifically? is that something you can draw on in your next match?
is there a special reason that you haven't been able to play on a consistent level during your career or during the past years? there are always lots of ups and downs.
you know that most people, most tennis fans, will want to see federer and nadal in the final. are you going to be a bad person and try and ruin that?
you can possibly face nadal. what do you expect of this matchup?
let's imagine.
is it better for you to play him here on a fast surface?
you struggled on hard courts in a couple events leading up to the us open, and i'm wondering what is it that you have found coming into this tournament, you know, since the us open series events that has propelled you to a semifinal?
what are your main weapons to win the next matchup? how would you describe yourself as a player for people who really don't know you?
what are your weakness on the court?
what are your better shots? how would you describe your game?
you've had a little bit of lackluster season, this hard court season. how do you explain your performance here at the us open?
are you pleased with the way you've played today? i know you like the result, but can you comment on the way you played today?
quarterfinal, making it to a quarterfinal in a grand slam, what does that mean to you?
there were six spanish guys that made it to the round of 16. as somebody on the tour, any explanation for why one country that's not that huge has so much success?
is there anything that when you face these guys they have in common, like something you know you're going to get from somebody? i know they're real good on clay, but is there anything they seem to all do well?
your opponent this afternoon had a one-handed backhand. you might potentially have with stanislas with a wawrinka next round, face another one-handed backhand. he won twice on clay against you; you've won twice on hard court most recently in miami, if i'm not mistaken. how would your tactics or your game vary against, you know, stan if he should make it through compared to querrey with a two-handed backhand? how would your game plan vary?
i couldn't hear what you said on court about your victory salute. do you give it a name? what is it?
do you practice it?
what was going through your mind when you were down the two sets and then down 1-4 in the fifth set tiebreaker? how were you able to come back?
could you kind of describe match point? that's a shot that is going to go down for a long time.
but was the space you were looking at actually between the net and the chair?
what kind of treatment did you require after this match? anything unusual?
but no iv or anything like that?
you're gonna maybe play nadal in the next round. you have not a great record against him. can you just talk about the challenge of playing nadal, and also talk about if you feel like his serve has changed or has improved in the last few months.
i'm talking about nadal's serve.
did you and david ferrer talk in the locker room after the match at all?
looking ahead to the nadal match, because i don't think you've had that many -- been two sets down and come backs like that. does that give you massive confidence, what you pulled off today?
can you talk about your physical state here. when you were treated in third set, was that your ankle?
what do you think was the difference in the fifth set?
it was such an incredible match to watch, but at the same time it's gotta to be emotionally, you know, so difficult. you played your heart out. what was it like coming off the court? how do you feel, basically, after that?
can you talk a little bit about, was it disappointing at all for the american men that you guys have all been eliminated before the quarterfinals in the second straight year?
did you feel any pressure at all?
when you win the fourth set, do you feel like you have all the momentum going into the fifth, or does the fifth become its own entity?
you did.
were you trying to channel your inner john isner on that, a fifth set with how long it was going?
he said that he thought you were getting a little bit tired and that you changed up i guess after the first three games or the first four games of the fifth set. was that how it changed to you?
that you changed up your game a little bit trying to compensate a little bit for some maybe some fatigue?
which leg?
is this the kind of match, because it was so close, that you'll replay a lot of the points in your head, or do you tend to just kind of let it go and move on?
late in the, i think it was maybe the last game in the match, at 30-all i think you tried to serve and volley. first time you did it all match, i think. was that out of tiredness or trying to change it up?
how would you describe just the atmosphere and how you felt about playing in there?
does it help you go about your business to have that all going on around you, or does it help you start to fight to stay in the match?
you know, the first couple of sets they seemed like they still had the labor day blahs, the crowd. only when you made a great shot or something did they sort of awaken. just wondered if you sort of felt that.
there were a lot of unforced errors out there, and i was wondering how much you would say that was attributable to the windy conditions?
end of the third set, do you remember you made a couple of pretty bad volleys?
do you recall those at all?
you said you didn't feel any pressure at all in terms of being the last american, but was that in any way something you had thought about, cared about?
is it personally frustrating to have to answer questions about the state of american men's tennis every time you lose a tennis match?
four titles this year; some decent runs; a good runs here, but not quite able to get it to the final stages. do you think you're ready to build on this? is this a building block for you? or what will you take from this?
i believe you were quoted as saying you want more americans to be playing ashe even earlier in the tournament, that that would give an advantage. i was wondering if that was quoted -- regardless of ranking, i was just curious what your thoughts are on that.
should be like affirmative action for americans on ashe?
did you expect to reach a quarterfinal this year, and what's your frustration level with not doing it in 2010?
andy is the only guy to reach a slam quarter this year, american guy. what would you attribute that to? is that satisfying for the u.s. guys to know that europeans are basically taking over the slams?
getting back to your serve, you mentioned before that was a big serving match. in some of those crucial moments you missed a bunch of first serves and you had crucial moments in second serves. do you feel like it let you down a little bit today?
you seem to play very calm on the exterior in a big match like this. is that a true reading, or is there stuff going on in there?
davis cup captain is a pretty important role in american tennis. if they came to you and said, hey, give us an indication of who you prefer, who would you say?
uh-huh.
do you have a preference yourself?
also, finally, if you could just assess pat's role as davis cup captain.
ten years.
you've been talking a lot this year about peaking at the slams. is this the closest you've come to bringing your best game ever at a major?
you had an incredible match with him at indian wells. what is it about your styles that create this kind of tennis? and the second question, have you hit with the kid collarini? what do you think of him?
yeah.
speaking of colombia, given the state of american tennis, is it really more than imperative to win this davis cup now more than ever, try to bring back some glory to the red, white, and blue to create some fan interest?
i guess what i'm getting at is the ryder cup, the golf equivalent, it was shown on nbc where the davis cup is on the minor league tennis channel. so that's what i'm saying, the importance of winning gets you to that next level for media exposure.
you mentioned a few moments ago nadal and ferrer scampering around versus your bigger serve. you haven't played nadal for a couple years. when you last played, did you feel like it was attackable or even a liability?
but back then you didn't think it was attackable?
you have some relatively quick turn around time between here and davis cup. in general, how does your body bounce back? it's a physical match. how do you think you'll bounce back?
obviously roger has far more slams than rafa, but right now, here now, who do you think is a better player?
does it bother you that you're probably the best tennis player who is not a household name at this point? do you see winning the open as a way to get into the federer/nadal household name?
what is the sort of mental approach to getting ready for a match against federer or nadal? you're one of the few guys that has beaten them on these stages.
henrik lundqvist, goalie for the new york rangers.
can you tell us a little of today's match? are you getting better in your form?
what improvements specifically do you need to make?
you didn't always seem to see eye-to-eye with the umpire. what was that about?
since you were runner-up at the french open last year, you have been very consistent in the slams. do you now expect yourself to be at least in the quarterfinals every time?
looks likely you'll be playing roger federer. do matches like that just pump you up even more, because you seem to get the better out of them than other players? i know you don't prepare differently.
if you do play federer, are you going to watch the replay of the del potro final last year?
is there a slight chance for melzer to win tonight?
how do you think you've managed to go through without dropping a set so far?
how do you feel about your run here this year?
you've beaten a lot of top players. what is it about novak that's given you problems? is it a matchup issue?
do you think the americans have gotten short shrift on the stadium courts this tournament?
can you predict from the way the flag is blowing where the wind is going, or is it different on the...
heading forward, have you set any kind of goals in terms of a ranking or results where you'd like to be at this time next year?
how did you feel today? i mean, it looked like you were laboring a little bit at times. how did you feel on the court?
do you feel like you missed an opportunity with that love-40 breakpoint in the middle of the second set?
yeah, you were.
i'm sure you're aware patrick mcenroe announced this morning he will be stepping down as davis cup captain after the tie in bogota. i'm wondering just your thoughts on his tenure as captain and what qualities you think are needed at the moment for his successor?
patrick and jos higueras were up here before talking about american tennis and why there would be six spaniards in the round of 16 and two americans. do you have any theories on that, about why spain, what they do? you play these guys. why do they do so well?
just to follow up on that, is there anything that spanish players do in general that you see, any characteristic of theirs as their approach to the game, strategy or mental?
yesterday sam said that too much is being made of the changes in your physique and the upgrade to your game. what are your thoughts right now about the changes in your game and your physique and what it might predict for the future?
playing djokovic, is it kind of hard to read him sometimes as far as get a rhythm because he has that sort of a sleeping giant effect where you can't really see what he's gonna...
what are your thoughts on sam's game and his chances here in week 2?
if u.s. men's tennis right now were a stock, what would you do?
mary carrillo was joking that you might let up on the diet now and have a beer or something to relax. is there something you are looking forward to?
speaking of harrison, what's your explanation for the lack of teens in the top 100 or 200?
john said he thought you were able to read his serve better than most of the other players. do you feel that way? if so, why?
what's it like out there when there is almost everybody for your opponent? did you like that atmosphere? did it bother you? was it fun?
you won the last match last year against isner. what was the difference between this match and the last one?
going into a match against him, are you willing to say that he's going to hit many aces and you just have to look for your spots on the return?
how important was it to get the break right off the start? he was playing from behind almost from the beginning of the match.
when he won the second set, what was your mind frame? at what point did you think you were really going to win the game?
you've now won on center court, arthur ashe at the us open. how much momentum do you think that gives you going to the next round?
felt like you served very well and he didn't serve maybe as well as could have. did that feel like the important swing in the match?
even though you didn't break him the first few games, did you get a sense you had a lot more chances the rest of the match based on how was playing?
can you talk about playing david? all the spaniards are doing well here. what are your feelings on that?
do you feel better now than you did maybe in washington?
nadal said on the court you had a baby.
two days ago?
boy or girl?
name?
when is your flight home, and how eager are you to get home?
were you distracted at all by these thoughts on the court?
did rafa say something to you at the net? i saw he gave a thumbs up.
when did you first hear from your wife that she had the baby and what was your reaction?
thursday morning?
first baby?
you were in manhattan in your hotel?
were you planning to not play anything after the open?
so you thought it was all going to work great?
this is your first baby?
it seems like the french are doing really well this year. overall i think there are six or seven players in the round of 32. i guess this means bigger, better things to come for the following year. would you agree with that?
did you ever change a diaper?
were you surprised at how suddenly this ended? other than the treatment he had, did you know he was this badly injured or sick?
everybody is now calling it the spanish armada has landed. you've always done well here. how does this whole group make you feel?
you hit the lob winner, and then he walked off the court. where you surprised by that?
spanish players are very close, great success in davis cup. how difficult is it for you to go into a tournament and have to play against some of your fellow countrymen?
have you played your way into ashe stadium?
so we're down to the three musketeers, are we?
in the states. yeah.
pretty good.
pretty noisy over there. even though you weren't on ashe, it was ashe-like noise.
how much of a sense of pride or importance is there beyond your own accomplishments to see a couple of other american guys make it?
is that anything you guys talk about, say, you and john?
coming into this tournament, there was the familiar refrain about, what happened to u.s. men's tennis? when you hear that, what goes through your mind? and as you're doing well in the tournament, is that on your mind at all?
so in your mind, how much of that familiar refrain is a misconception?
are you beginning to feel the spirit that connors, mcenroe, sampras, and agassi experienced on the court now?
you're beginning to feel the spirit that connors mcenroe and sampras and agassi experienced with the fans today?
do you feel like you're playing well right now compared to, say, how you were playing in la or some of the other summer tournaments?
will you watch the match when you leave here?
if it does turn out to be andy murray you will play, could you just talk about that? you've know him for a long time and played him a few times, as you've said.
what was the key to your win today, and how did the wind play a factor in what you did on court?
with so much depth with the men's field, what is the difference, you think, between the champions and the guys who might even rise as high as 6 or 7 on something? is it tennis skill? is it in the head? is it just consistency? what do you think?
how big of an advantage is it to have the crowd behind you? regardless of what court you're in on the next round, you're gonna have a majority of the support.
do you think almagro was a little bit undone by crowd sentiment today?
you've done well in the smaller tournaments. i think you've won four this year. what do you have to do to carry that same kind of success to the next level, to the cincinnatis or to the slams?
you spoke earlier about if your opponent in the next round is andy murray. if the upset occurs and it's wawrinka, can you describe what that matchup would be for you since we're not going to have an opportunity to speak with you before that?
you made the fourth round here a couple years back. how, if at all, would you say you're different as a player and maybe as a person?
when does it hit you to say, hey, i've got to be professional about this and really work on it, and you thought perhaps before that everything was okay but you needed more?
well, when you finally told sam querrey, i'm not working hard enough, and if i'm gonna be a professional, i'm gonna be a professional.
what was that day?
no, but summer of...
how would you describe mardy's transformation?
are you going to ask him advice on how to play murray?
you go to roland garros, and clment and tsonga and monfils are always on center court; except for a couple of matches, you and john and mardy have been pretty much on armstrong or grandstand. could you comment on that, and do you think it would help your games to be on a big stage more often?
have you played a match on ashe yet?
so if this turned out to be a night match, what are your feelings going into that?
i would imagine that every player at some point has that moment where they say, you know what, i can win this thing; i can win this tournament. have you had that moment yet, or are you still waiting for that moment?
any physical issues out there today?
so what was the treatment for then when the trainer came on?
when did you first start to feel the problems?
did it affect you moving one side or the other or any particular shot?
did fatigue play a part at all today?
could starting your tournament late then have been a factor?
so what was the problem? was it partly stanislas...
there were various incidents, including the one in the first set in the tiebreak. can you explain what happened where it seemed like the ball hit the net and he celebrated too early?
there was another incident, said something to a ball boy. i wasn't sure who you were talking to.
i'm not sure.
you said he played better than you. you know stan. you practice with him sometimes. have you noticed any change in his game today?
you must obviously be very, very disappointed. could you express your feelings. what do you think you have to do to get through in a major?
john mcenroe said at one point, andy is fighting himself as much as wawrinka. would that be a fair comment?
first two matches you played you were in top form, and there was not sign of a performance like this coming today really.
the mounting frustration that came to you in that match, including punching the strings, do you find yourself impossible to get out of that frustration? does it overwhelm you? what is it?
specifically to this one, andy, i'm talking about. a huge amount of frustration in you.
any reason why? can you put your finger on it?
is it doubly frustrating given that you've found your form again and played well in the american tournaments?
this is the last major of the year. how would you assess your season through now?
when you said you haven't felt like this for a long time, are you saying that you felt as fatigued in the third and fourth sets like perhaps three or four years ago before you got super fit?
what was and wasn't working for you on the court today?
does it put any doubt in your mind about the future, about cracking it, getting the big one in the bag?
do you have the impression that wawrinka was more aggressive today than usually when you played him?
you played sam earlier this summer. how would you analyze the next round?
you mentioned the coaching situation before the start of the tournament. does this in any way accelerate the search?
is this something then that you feel you have to sort out personally yourself, the situation, rather than something a coach could help you sort out? is this something that needs to be sorted out with you?
you said dealing with the situation now, you haven't felt like this for a while; you have to work out why you're in this situation. is that something that can only come from you, or can a third party help?
i know it's right after the match, but how hard is this one to take for you?
stan often struggles against the top guys mentally. do you think he changed something there?
i know it wasn't applicable today, but do you have any feelings on the best of five versus best of three in a grand slam? do you like the best of five format?
wimbledon is the last.
why do you not like that? because it can go...
you have a very good record in fifth sets. why do you think that is?
you beat rafa at queen's, and you can play him next round. can you just discuss that match and how you think it would...
how do you like this surface? i mean, you're a very aggressive player, you're a very good server. how do you like this surface?
talk a little bit about the success of the spanish players. obviously they can play on all surfaces, but it's a very, very good week for everyone.
did you practice with any of those guys the week of open? i know you played la last month, but were you practicing with any of the spanish guys?
do you think you are pushing one another to get better, that you are better because you have this competition within your country?
i know this happened a few years ago, but when you went into argentina and beat del potro in the davis cup final, that was a huge win. did that do anything for you as a player or for your confidence?
do you think nadal is gonna be able to figure out how to win this tournament here in new york eventually?
you're a friend. do you think he will figure it out? do you think he will do it eventually?
i know you didn't get the preparation you wanted for this tournament because of the ankle. do you think there's any leftovers physically from wimbledon, as well?
it seemed like you had the momentum really on your side after the second set tiebreak all the way into the third. it turned so fast at the end. what happened in the last three or four points of the third set?
was fatigue a factor at all in the end?
it seemed like it was tough for you to close at net a number of times. he also returned fairly well, right?
did you feel like you were playing from behind? you got broken right off the bat. it was uphill almost all the way from then.
your ankle was good? it held up?
does that mean you weren't really getting a good enough push and felt slow at the first step?
i think in the second set you had five set balls or something, and you seemed to be nervous. how did you feel, because you didn't play as aggressive in important moments?
would you like to take some time off now to recover? do you know what you want to do?
would it be smart to not play for the long-term?
i know you were looking forward to playing on ashe as the headline tonight. with that in mind, how disappointing was this?
sam was saying earlier that he thought it would be great if you and mardy had all been scheduled in ashe in the earlier rounds so that it wasn't these big matchups, and suddenly, poof, you're there playing on america's biggest tennis stage. do you agree? do you think it would have benefited you to play on that court in your first and second round?
does your ankle need rest or are you rehabbing it? what does it need?
so you're going to colombia. the bryan brothers aren't going, or one of you guys are going to play singles?
do you still get in touch with players with whom you played for college, and maybe did some of them come to support you?
at what point were you confident that you had that match?
i know you said you were rooting for james to win out there. he's down 5-love. how exciting would it be if you could play him and how disappointing would it be if he goes out?
how different is it psychologically to go into a fifth set after losing the fourth set as opposed to winning the fourth set to force a fifth?
on court you mentioned the importance of the us open, but also spoke about how armstrong is one of the great courts in tennis. can you talk about what makes it so special?
it was really once notorious with the planes coming over years ago. are you aware of any of the sounds, both of the crowd, the trains?
somewhere in the back of your mind, the americans have a real tough time at roland garros, tough losses. in the back of your mind, you know you're playing a french guy, this is home turf, that gives you a bit of an advantage?
you've had a decent season this season. what do you attribute it to?
federer had some flattering comments about the changes you made. how does it feel to get respect from your peers like that?
when it comes down to one set, winner take all, what is the predominant emotion? do you relish that? are you excited? is it stressful?
at the end of the match when you were thanking the crowd, kind of a curious victory gesture there, sort of andre agassi meets four corners...
the four corners.
have you done that before?
one player told me he actually finds it easier to focus and execute shots in a fifth set because you just know that you have to bear down.
if stacey said to you over coffee one morning, don't worry, mardy, you're going to be one of the hottest players of the summer, reach the fourth round...
and you said?
what would you say?
and your buddy andy, has he texted you?
it looked like you played with a lot of poise. he had the breakpoints early. in the tiebreak he had a chance. what are you most satisfied with how you played tonight?
you've played mardy. you know him well. what kind of match do you expect?
have you watched federer's commercial where he tried to hit a ball off somebody's head?
do you believe it's possible?
do you dare to be somebody's target?
how do you feel physically after all your long matches?
unusual question for you: what do you think about russian tennis, and what do you think about russian success of the last couple of years? do you have any russian friends on the tour?
you had the two breakpoints first game, and then the tiebreak you had that forehand lined up. did you feel like you found your rhythm or game at any point tonight, or was he just too tough?
where do you go from here?
were there any emotions walking off the court? are you leaving here thinking, i'm going to be back here next year?
when you were close in the second set there, can you feel how you can turn that crowd in your favor?
when you say you feel you have more in you, is that because you feel like you're not physically at your best so you don't know right now whether your best isn't good enough?
that wind tonight at its worst, you play in conditions like that before?
what do you have to do physically to get yourself back so that you're not going on a charity tour?
where was thomas and the rest of your gang tonight?
how much of a guide has your mom been for you?
do you have any ideas of what the options are after tennis? is it going to be inside or outside the sport?
how is your golf game?
there were some unhappy people at the usta office. you broke their hearts here.
you aced him two straight. did you feel that that was the breaker at that point, that he didn't return your serve at the end?
exactly, 6-3.
when you returned it, did you say, hey, i put this one in play; he's gonna probably crack it?
what was the overall atmosphere like out there?
that's gotta be a learning experience.
how did the rain delay affect you? you came out and held your serve, but then obviously he came back.
the crowd did cheer for you when you shook the cameraman's hand.
how surprised were you by ryan? how much had you seen of him?
what do you think of his potential?
are you still a little bit stunned that you did win this match in the end after being down three points after the back and forth and back and forth that it kind of ended so quickly in your mind?
how hard was it with the crowd? you may have answered this already. i came in late.
do you remember a match where you lost when you were younger, maybe you had a chance to win that you really learned form that really helped you later on?
do you have to tell yourself when the crowd is going like that, okay, it's just because he's an american; it's nothing personal?
do you think part of it also is you're from the ukraine and they pulled out the old war words come back?
you come in coming off the win in new haven, and you've reached for the first time your third round in a grand slam. if i'm not mistaken, do you feel now at 24 years of age coming in with, i would think, confidence off the new haven win and now, you know, coming into the third round, do you feel right now this is a big turning point in your career?
coming off the win, do you feel right now that your own expectations of yourself has risen?
so you're enjoying yourself?
when he was serving at match point, are you surprised he didn't try and hit a harder serve?
you have a very unique style of play. you have a similar style to your opponent today. what is complicated? what complicates that style of play for you?
for you.
no, just with your own game. it's very precise. you come to the net.
but like you also used the slice a lot and the chip in dropshots; you were hitting a bunch of dropshots.
so what would you say or what would your reaction be to people who would say it would be very refreshing to see your style of play and your matchup against ryan today? any comments on that?
the game has been dominated largely by power baseliners for a decade. what is your comment about people who would say you guys are bright lights for a very exciting, different style of play?
in the on-court interview afterwards, you said your arm felt loose on your serve. how did that affect your serve?
did you catch any of the harrison match?
when you see an up-and-coming kid make some way in the open, does that harken you back to a time when you were in that position?
seeing that roddick is out, it's just you and isner and mardy fish, the american crew there. you're one of the top americans left. does it give you any extra push to say, i have to carry the mantle for the united states?
that is center court.
tired?
if you could just talk about the match, your thoughts on how you played today.
when you say you were dealt a bad hand, what exactly are you referring to?
your ankle didn't bother at all? it's okay?
when someone in sports does something as you did in wimbledon, years later they're still talking about it. some athletes are bothered by it, and others relish it. what's been your reaction to the two months?
will you need a little more pop in your legs against youzhny? what do you have to do well in that match?
if you feel like your fitness isn't where you want it to be, does that mean just taking some bigger risks on your serve and on your forehand? is that gonna be the strategy?
ryan harrison lost in the fifth set breaker after having some match points, and i'm wondering about the learning curve for a young player learning how to play in a fifth set. what is there to learn and did you go through it yourself?
do you change things in the fifth set or stick with the same stuff or...
could you hear that match from where you were in louis? did you hear the crowd in there?
for a long time, you'll always be related to nicolas mahut. he's sort of had a tough go of it; he's been saying his body hasn't been the same; hasn't had a very good summer; didn't get a wildcard or anything here. do you have any thoughts about nicolas and have you been in touch with him at all and could you reflect on that?
did he say anything of interest to you about the match?
can you talk about whether you've had any surprises in your physical conditioning while you've been playing here or with regard to the ankle? because you spoke obviously at every step along the way about the hope that you would improve certainly your lung capacity with playing more and also the condition of your ankle. what has it been like for you?
given that there are no teenage men in the top 100 of the world rankings, do you think that's more motivation for kids to go to college a year or two? do you think more guys should follow the route you took?
grand slams, tim henman used to always say he felt the weight of the whole british empire on his shoulders. with so few americans left standing, do you feel the weight of being one of the great american hopes?
what was going through your mind in the match points, and did you play each match point the way you wanted to play them?
i know it's obviously immediate, very early, but are you able to share any thoughts about how you might look back on the whole of this experience, coming through qualifying, you know, getting as far as you did today?
did you play your doubles match yesterday?
have any affect on you?
two opposite questions: what was the fun factor like out there for you? and secondly, how long will this loss stay with you?
speaking of experience, a lot of young players have to go through learning how to play a fifth set. how did it feel different to you in the fifth set, and do you think differently in the fifth set?
when do you remember doing that, thinking about the score? fifth set or...
you have a very unique style of play out there. it's fabulous, very entertaining. where does your style of play come from?
when the crowd was chanting, let's go ryan in the fifth set, how did that feel to you? has that ever happen to you, have a large crowd chant your name like that?
when you were younger, did you ever come and watch matches on that court?
you mentioned the triple match point. what do you hope to gain from the experience of the last few moments of this match?
you know how competitive men's tennis is, and this is definitely a breakthrough couple of weeks for you. how do you take this and get to the next step?
but this helps with your belief at a certain level?
there have been plenty of cases where young guys turn pro, you know, 15, 16, and it doesn't serve them well. i mean, the steady diet of losses, maybe they don't physically mature as expected. can you tell us a little bit in your case, you know, what is it about you mentally or confidence-wise or in terms of your support system that's enabled you the last few years to stay on the path and steadily progress?
was it 15 when you turned pro?
you're aware one of the storylines here has been basically been the lack of american players, querrey and isner. are you ready to grasp the role of great american hope?
of all the feelings you had on a tennis court, how would you compare what you experienced here?
you said that you had a clear plan at least in the match going in.
do you have a clear plan in your mind of your career?
two years, three years, and how soon can you win a grand slam?
what did you learn from being a hitting partner for the davis cup around all those big players?
following the open, what's your favorite moments?
the serve and volley game of course is such a rare sight on the tour these days. even guys like federer don't do it so much anymore. did anybody ever try to sell you out of that style of play, or were you pretty determined stick with that style of game?
did he show you anything different that you hadn't experienced before?
your opponent today.
you looked like you enjoyed yourself out there today.
in your box, they were shouting, you can really do it if you want to do it. but you didn't do it, at least this time. do you think you ran out of gas or confidence? i mean, ashe stadium, seeing a lot of people, did it mess with your psyche?
what are the things you think you need to work on if you could do this to beat andy murray?
with very little grand slam experience, only played in one other, to find yourself on a stadium like arthur ashe and playing one of the top players in the world, did it feel somewhat surreal? what did it mean to you to be in that theater?
you never played andy before?
talk about him as a player. what were your thoughts on his game?
when you aced him twice in the first set, you must have felt pretty terrific.
can you talk about the length of the rallies? seemed like you really had your success with andy when you were able to keep the points short.
you seem to be an instant, like, crowd favorite. for this crowd to get behind you and embrace you like that, how did it feel?
tough players have an intimidation factor because of their record coming into a court like this. he's played in major show courts around the world. when the match ran away, do you sense that his focus was so strong he imposes his character on the court?
let's talk fashion. your dreads are kickin'. i think they're adorable. they are. you have neon green shoe strings and the pink. is that your fashion statement from now on?
i sense a neon lace endorsement deal in the your future?
what's murray like to play against now that you've had a match against him? he has this habit of like chasing down every ball, and never let's the opponents win easy points. is that what you helped today?
do you ever use the courtside chair?
you stand up at every changeover.
how much popularity do you get back home to make a country that's, you know, mostly about soccer and track and field, as a tennis player, do you feel that your popularity is growing back home?
are you as popular as usain bolt?
do you think this high profile here playing on ashe, us open, that's maybe gonna make your phone ring a little bit more? are you any more secure about who you want to play for, uk, germany, jamaica?
could you talk about the match, the way you felt you played today.
the expectations of you are higher going into a grand slam. from your perspective, do you feel that expectations are higher because of the kind of year you've been having? if so, how does that affect you?
how do you feel about playing in new york?
it's very early in the tournament. most players like to go match by match. do you project ahead a little bit, what it would be like to be in a semifinal or final here?
you mentioned you don't play well all the time. you don't want to leave it to chance. what will you do to try to maybe help that along so it isn't just luck?
the way you celebrated at the end suggested that was a match that could be difficult for you. is that fair to say?
there's been a lot of talk about what magnus has done for you as far as making you a better player, helping you rise in the rankings. i know you're recently married. can you talk about how that has helped you?
what is it about being married as a pro tennis player? is there a feeling you might lose your competitive edge if you get married?
what do you know about your next opponent?
how fast are the courts playing this year?
do you prefer it a little bit slower or are you happy the way it is?
i noticed that you had 14 aces throughout the match, but you only had 52% first serve percentage. what else did you do right out there today?
any other shots in particular or parts of your game that may have won you some points specifically?
you made the quarters here a couple years ago. is there a sense of house money? you seem so relaxed in the big spots as you were today.
it just seems weird. this is your 10th us open, and to find yourself in that spot 10 years out.
is there a greater satisfaction knowing what it takes to do all that and having gone through all of that to be where you are?
we have expectations for you, but what are your expectations?
i'm wondering with all that heat and humidity if you might still be losing weight on us here.
might you actually lose up to four or five pounds out there today?
what about today? did you go down?
tennis is obviously a sport of up and downs; everyone goes through that. close friends with andy. what's your read on the sort of big picture? good spring and sort of some problems after.
do you think he could win another slam?
what are your thoughts on whether andy plays aggressively enough when he's on the court? there was discussion after his match yesterday. his opponent said he doesn't see andy as being the aggressor as much as he should be.
the other day when you were talking you were saying how like before the weight started to come off you stopped right before you got tired. how did it change once the weight came off, and how are you feeling now?
when did that whole process start exactly?
you closed both of these matches pretty convincingly. is that a part of the fitness, of the, of the confidence, are you trying to put the hammer down?
can you talk about the conditions out there today? specifically, the heat early on and then the wind later in the match.
in this extreme heat, have you lost any weight? i know some commentators mentioned you've been looking a little skinny.
you mentioned that you had muscle pain in toronto; earlier this week you were talking about it. how are you feeling now?
at this point in your career, is it any more important for you to make sure you get off court as soon and quickly as possible?
after last night's match, andy roddick's opponent said he didn't think roddick was as aggressive as he should be in that match, and it's pretty well known he should be more aggressive. what's your opinion of roddick's degree of aggressiveness and his approach in the court?
you alluded earlier to the short durations of your first two matches, two straight set win. is this sort of the perfect way, in terms of looking at the way you're launching this particular campaign? do you feel like you're you've gotten off to a more or less good start?
the women's top seed is wozniacki, also one of the youngest players. what do you make of her success?
have you seen any huge improvements in your style lately with paul on your team now?
you're the only past champion left in the men's tournament. how much of an advantage is that, or a help is that, knowing you've done it in the past versus other players who are trying to but don't know that they can, because they haven't?
in the last couple of days, several people have spoken about the shot you made the other day through your legs.
but novak djokovic said he didn't need to see that one. the one he saw last year...
how do you look back at the shot you made against him last year, and what made it special for you?
what goes through your mind when you see replays of that point?
in the spring and in paris there was a lot of talk about new string.
advances in a new string from babolat. are you an equipment guy in that when you hear about new equipment or strings or racquets, you test things, or are you very conservative when you have your equipment and you stick with it? pete always...
what do you think about russian tennis? maybe have some russian friends on tour?
i just wanted to ask you about a habit of yours, kind of helping the ball boys out during matches, and do you do it sort of out of a sense of politeness or playfulness, or does it help your game? help in the match? comment on that.
two matches in, do you feel like your game and your body are exactly where you want them to be?
could you explain what happened to your body at the end of the match in the fifth set.
is it difficult to lose a match when you fight so hard to come up short?
coming into this tournament, i know you didn't get good results in the us open series leading up, but can you talk about your condition in the late summer and how you felt coming into the tournament? did you feel physically and mentally ready to go the distance deep into this tournament?
did you feel at some point that you may not be able to get up and go back out on the court?
when he was working on you, did you feel like, this is it?
you played kei two years ago in indian wells. last time you won very easily. compared to that match, did you see any progress in kei? did he do anything which surprised you?
when she asked you earlier about your body at the end, what were you feeling? you mentioned oxygen. were you having trouble getting air? were you having cramps?
so what can tennis fans expect from you this tournament? what do you want out of this tournament at this point?
is your body at the point where you can play your best?
at wimbledon, did you say you were not going to take anti-inflammatories for the knee? did you change your mind on that?
how different is the mental approach when the expectations are different than when you were at the top of your game?
we all have regrets in our lives. you mentioned regrets. you've had some tough spots, the andre match, the olympic situation. what are the one or two regrets that you have that you could change if you could go back?
you've always been a fearless thinker. your play was extraordinary out there on the stadium. you were back to your peak form. do you really believe you can win this tournament? are you thinking that big?
if it is djokovic, how would you describe that matchup?
looked like your confidence was growing during the match. in the tiebreaker, you really sprayed some shots pretty awfully. was that an issue of confidence?
you have the mets cap on. should manuel go?
talk as a fan.
who do you see as manager?
you got pretty heated with the chair umpire. what was that exchange about?
as the age of the top men and women skews older, do you think more kids will choose to go the college route like you and robert kendrick did, or will there always be people turning pro early?
your confidence level sounds much greater than it's been anytime this summer. is that because you're at the open? is it because you felt like the tennis was coming anyway, you just needed a couple wins and then things would start to click?
was the serve the biggest problem?
what was the biggest problem?
what is your issue with the heat? do you sweat too much?
would you be in favor of a heat rule for the men?
no, but seriously, would you...
would a break help, 10-minute break?
hardcourts make it worse?
you've faced him before. what does he do well? he seems to mix it up pretty well.
here in the states, we're always looking for the next great player. he's 18 and one of the kids that's talked about. obviously it's hard to gauge somebody's potential at 18.
are you playing next year? have you made that decision?
is it in the balance, or how's it looking for you at this point?
do you think if you hadn't won at indian wells that that decision would be kind of made by now?
you're a veteran. i'm wondering if through the years the amount of hair gel players are using has increased.
but are you surprised? i mean, when you came on tour, did you see that there was as much use of that as there is today?
a little easier than your last first-round match of a slam?
how close were you to not playing here?
you say 'all systems go.' how concerned were you about how the ankle would hold up?
completely torn ligaments?
aren't you worried now you'll tear it now that you're here?
do you think you can train now, or do you have to treat it differently still as far as in between matches?
you were told four to six?
would you say 70%, 80%?
is there pain when you're playing? do you feel anything in it?
you mentioned something about being on a machine with your ankle. was that several hours?
how did you find the machine?
it seemed like in the first set especially you were trying to come to the net a lot more. is that something you've been working on, or is that part of an effort to shorten the point and preserve your ankle?
querrey talked today how you have to learn that you belong in the top 25, the top 20, the process of moving along. your thoughts on that and how that's going.
what do you think about the grind of the five-set matches here possibly, obviously you have to win three, the length of the tournament, and your physical condition?
how do you get stronger when you're out there trying to battle an opponent and make it through?
how long did it take you to physically recover from wimbledon? did it take you longer than you thought? were you more tired than you realized?
can you characterize how different things are for you in new york this year in terms of people recognizing you, your level of celebrity? how different is it one year later?
did you feel any responsibility to play here even though you were a little injured because of what happened in wimbledon and knowing that it gave tennis a boost and people would be looking to see you?
the other day melanie spoke about what goes through her mind when people ask her about her run here last year. what goes through your mind when people ask you about the match at wimbledon now after a couple of months?
melanie said she thinks you're sick of being asked about it.
did you see nicolas today?
has one day gone by since wimbledon where you didn't have to answer a question about it?
with the phone off?
maybe somebody will beat the record, is that what you're hoping?
you missed an overhead in the second set. is it often that you miss an overhead like that?
you mentioned you got together with mahut. can you describe what that was like?
do you wish he'd gotten a wildcard? do you think he should have?
you played ljubicic before this year. you probably watched him for a few years. was this a good matchup for you? was it a good matchup going in?
is this a big step forward in your mind of what you can achieve?
there's a lot of talk with the mcenroes, john and patrick, about the future of american tennis. who is the next big american star. do you embrace that and want to be that guy?
who has given you the best advice?
did you really lose to your father in the city championships when you were 11, and what were the scores?
what was it like leading into that match?
i know this one is bigger. with your dad.
first time you beat him?
correct me if i'm wrong, you were never ranked higher than 7th in the world as a junior. are you a late bloomer at 18? what's come on for you now?
was variety a big thing for your dad? did it matter to him?
yeah.
watching you on court 11, you didn't seem to show a lot of emotion during the match. is that your style? are you a calm player, or just trying to stay cool today?
what are the sort of things that andy has told you about working at the game and maybe about playing another player? can you recall any of the specifics of that?
can you recount the specific for that?
what have you learned since you've played in australia, and do you feel any different coming into this level of a tournament now?
it's rare for a qualifier to beat a ranked player. you seem like you thought you could do thi. you don't seem overwhelmed by it. like, oh, my god i did this.
ljubicic said that he thought the fact that you came through the quallies as opposed to getting a wildcard probably helped you. do you feel that's the case?
what did he say to you afterwards? anything?
what level of schooling have you had?
you actually were not in attendance at that school?
she was not pushing the college route at all?
have you trained in boca with some of the usta developmental coaches, and what's that experience been like?
have you played a lot of tournaments in hotter weather than this?
it was extreme, testing the conditions out there, the heat.
obviously a very good win. crowd was really on your side.
will you be catching any of andy's match if you get the chance?
just about to win the second set.
you're serving really well today.
and the dropshot, too, yeah?
were you using that particularly because of the player you were facing?
the dropshot.
if you do play murray, what sort of match would you expect?
did you make any progress with your inquiries about playing davis cup for great britain?
there was a suggestion that you had to get a british passport or something.
are they giving you any more financial backing since wimbledon?
what's the biggest crowd you've played in front of, and how will you cope with that when you possibly play andy?
all things being equal and financial support and everything, would you rather play for jamaica?
do you know andy at all?
any relationships at all?
what do you make of him as a player? is he one of the guys you fear playing, or actually enjoy playing against someone like that?
have you always played with that kind of explosive style that you brought to the court today? has that always been an expressive way of playing tennis?
it doesn't seem like as though you could possibly play a boring point. every point you play has something...
do you think the crowd, if against murray, would be on your side again?
are there a lot of jamaican guys coming?
what do you think you can achieve ultimately in your career?
how are you financing yourself at the moment?
winnings?
there's talk of a camper van.
where is home?
does it cost you money to come to these bigger tournaments, as well? are you out of pocket?
what's your coaching setup at the moment?
is there any reason why you don't have a permanent coach?
no money? yeah.
do you envy someone like murray when you see the money that big players like him earn?
do you get a sense that there's a following at home for what you're achieving? will there be sort of a fevered anticipation in jamaica for you?
after newport, why did you go back to europe and play on clay when you could have played on hard?
what happened to you out there this afternoon?
i know you've cited your fitness as a big reason for your success, but i'm wondering, was there ever a point in the past couple months where you wondered, have i lost maybe too much weight in order to withstand a five-set test? was that a thought? and if so, what did today tell you?
during the summer, can you talk about the motivating factor in your decision to go on the diet?
do you consider it sort of a body reinvention or career reinvention?
do you look at pictures of yourself just from a couple years ago?
really? it's just that stark to you, the difference?
what do you feel when you say you feel completely different? try and describe what feels different.
is there one thing that was hardest to give up?
does it say anything about tennis and what it takes to play at a high level that you could have been an elite player 30 pounds heavier?
how did your new physique and your new mental state affect today's match in your mind?
was this a match you would have lost before?
why didn't you do it sooner, like a couple years ago?
coming off the third set, you had to be thinking, no way can i lose this match given all the results i had this summer.
you've had two slam quarters before. you've come into tournaments playing well. i would think as well as you're playing now, a slam semi isn't completely out of the question, huh?
couple years ago i think you lost a five-setter here early on. we were talking about your career, and i used the word, "journeyman" which you weren't very happy at the time. but now that you've had this resurgence, were you concerned that it was going in that direction? thankfully now that there has been this a resurgence, and you said you were happy with the higher expectations, but you can't go under the radar screen anymore. is that also...
you have been talking about this before, but a big part of our sport, so mental, is belief. you've have had really a breakout season. it's a long ways away, but in your gut, do you think you can win this thing, go all the way? talk about that, and belief.
jimmy connors said earlier today that your situation was kind of a better-late-than-never scenario. are you okay if that's kind of the truth? are you not somebody who is going to look back with any regret?
talk about the support your wife has given you and gives you. there was a belief with borg and mcenroe where they kind of dovetailed after getting married, and that married life would kind of takes away the competitive spirit and your focus. you seem to have the opposite experience.
do you look up to her in the stands for support? is it something that you...
when you were talking to brad on the court afterwards, you alluded to fan support that you received that helped you turn things around out there. can you comment on that?
while you were playing, it was 109 degrees on the court. talk about that experience.
what is your worst, hottest, most uncomfortable moment out there?
when you start to panic, talk about that moment.
what was the turning point for you? what did you find that helped you to turn things around out there?
how well do you two know each other? what is the history of your backgrounds?
is it an added challenge to play with someone you have an emotional connection with?
you said you never have seen him serve like that.
what was different today?
have you seen the federer video on the internet when he knocks the can off somebody's head?
did you see the replay or the actual live shot of his tween-the-legs shot last night?
when it happened last year, did you see the moments of your lives pass...
it had a lot of zip on it. it wasn't just putting it back in play.
as somebody who does very good imitations, is that something you can imitate?
you made a comment about sleeping with your girlfriend out on the court. what was that analogy to?
must have felt good.
first of all, you were playing out there in tremendous heat, five setter. talk about the match a little bit.
you had maybe not particularly good results coming in in the us open series. been able to go out, and marcos is obviously a very good player. i mean, talk about your sort of your abilities right now. do you feel right now like you could maybe have a run here? just the way you're playing right now, can you just describe that.
one match, i mean, it sounds like it has psychologically made a big difference with you in the course of just, you know, this one match can really turn around a player's confidence?
i remember your run here in 2000, and it's really hard to believe that that was actually 10 years ago. but you had some tremendous experiences at this tournament and out on center court. do you still think about that run? does that help you at all, even though it's 10 years later? can you reflect a little bit about that.
you talked a moment ago about heat. do you think there should be a heat policy for the men like they have for the women?
why not?
so should men have it or not?
it's been a good day for french tennis today so far.
is there anything you'd like to say about that to french fans?
you seem to be a liberal user of hair gel. i remember mahut at wimbledon, he played 11 hours...
you don't?
i remember mahut at wimbledon didn't move the whole time.
are certain players, is there a station in the locker room, the wax station, for your hair?
why do some guys use it and some guys not?
so-so right now.
maybe i can borrow your wax.
what did you think when you heard the string break on break point in the third set?
got to feel good for you getting through that first one in straight sets.
at this stage, do you appreciate the fan support more than you used to?
did that feel like a farewell at all last night, the ceremony?
andre agassi might be up for the hall of fame pretty quickly. what are some of your thoughts about his contribution to the game of tennis and your own personal interactions with him when you wore the outfit as an homage?
what are your thoughts on the mardy fish transformation, both in his physique and his mental approach?
what do you make of all the weight he lost, how he handled his diet and what he's done now?
how would you describe what the vibe is here around the grounds at the stadium when you play a night match here?
did you see roger's trick shot last night?
can you talk about that as a player.
did you see the video where he knocks the can off somebody's head?
is that something you would ever try if someone posed that challenge to you?
good enough, though, to take on that kind of a challenge, that's unrealistic, even for a professional tennis player?
you played a lot of great matches here. does the win over youzhny in portland in '07 stand out for you still as your greatest match of your career?
as an outsider, it seems surprising that a guy could have been a pro tennis player, an elite player, then have 30 pounds to lose. where would you get it?
is he going to start a trend among guys?
what happened out there today?
how do you explain that? you've played well most of this summer.
how much did the heat affect you?
how do you explain the success you've had in other slams versus this one? how disappointed are you when the crowd seems to want to love you and...
did you miss it while you were away for the last couple of years?
this is a little off the subject, but we all know mardy fish lost like 30 pounds, and roddick had talked last year about losing a lot of weight. i'm wondering, where can a guy playing five sets and playing professional tennis find that much weight to lose? does that seem weird to you, that somebody can lose that much weight and still be competitive?
it just seems like you were already fit. where would you find the weight to lose? if you're playing tennis, seems like you're a pretty fit guy.
do you think it would help? i mean...
do you have like a weight that you're comfortable with that you like to play with, or did it not even come up as far as you're concerned?
where would you rank today as far as the court conditions and the heat among all your matches that you've played? was it, you know, top 5 hottest day?
how hot was it for you?
what can you say on clment, who at 32 is still playing this kind of tennis?
you have the cyprus emblem on your clothes right now. can you explain why that is?
is it the office of tourism?
how long have you been without a sponsor?
who makes the clothes?
that was quite a battle in the end. you must be pretty pleased to have gotten through it.
it must have been frustrating, because you could have finished it off when it was sort of an hour and a half...
i'm sure better than winning in five is winning in three, especially when you're beginning a fortnight tournament. but on the other hand, one can say that starting a tournament, being pushed, being pressed, and being able to prevail in five sets is not so bad a way to start, yeah?
are you happy with the game, happy with the way you played out there?
do you come into this tournament feeling that expectations are higher of you now than ever before entering this particular tournament? if so...
are you as confident entering this tournament as you've ever been at this time of the season?
is the confidence high when you go into a grand slam? you talked about both wimbledon and roland garros where you obviously played well. do you then arrive at grand slams with an extra sort of buzz about it? seems to bring out the best in you.
could you talk about the conditions out there today and what you learned about the state of your game, how you feel about it?
how have you been practicing? how do you feel? do you feel 100% or 98? where are you?
aside from how you might say it felt on the court today, in terms of your preparation, have you been able to prepare at least in the last week or so the way you would have liked to?
what does 28 years old mean to you? i mean, right in your prime. how do you look at that?
you're still a big miami heat fan?
just your reaction to what this team...
it looks like james, you know, might be winding down his career. can you talk about his career a little bit, and also what you remember about his match with agassi in 2005.
he's gonna be honored tonight. so many years that the two of you were a tandem in davis cup. talk about that synergy, having each other's back and so forth.
do you feel good about your role in american tennis? as it was, andre sort of gave you a lot of advice, and then you were the leader of the davis cup team. now you've been real helpful to sam and john. can you talk about that a little bit.
when you come back to play this tournament, how much do you think about 2003, what happened then?
as a huge sports fan, what were your thoughts when you first heard that roger clemens was indicted? you may have heard that today he entered a not guilty plea.
for those of us who haven't seen the lockers, can you just briefly describe what it is...
name and the year you won?
you spoke before about james' character. when you think of nadal and federer and their rivalry, how much do you think about character and how much do you think of their performances against one another?
do you still have a place in new york?
do you spend a lot of time here or...
do you feel more like a new yorker now than maybe three or four years ago?
he had a big first round at wimbledon.
happy to make sure he didn't have a big first round here.
do you not want to get involved in baseline rallies? i know it's difficult to get in now with these balls and all of rest of it. what is your philosophy, get in as soon as you can?
how many times did you serve-volley today, would you say?
i didn't see it at all.
is that something you thought coming in you would have to do?
we were reminiscing about last year's epic. what is your health situation now?
what is the difference between getting in shape playing matches and being in the gym?
this is not in any way an accusation. just curious. mardy fish drops that weight; does anything go through your mind? is that not even an option?
what was the most desperate measure you've ever taken to lose weight?
you have soderling next. what is your head-to-head?
when you're going against soderling, you really made some advances. what is your thought about him? do you scout him? do you do anything? do you just do your thing?
are you pleased with the way that you played out there today?
are you pleased? are you happy?
that's all right. content? happy? not happy?
you started the season very strong, but i know you were out with injury. if you could talk a little bit about your physical condition right now, are you able to go out there and play at 100% or less, and if you could describe, please.
so you're uncertain right now about your ability to really go out and be, you know, your full self? it sounds to me you are a bit uncertain about your condition.
how has the season been for you, though? you had some weeks off and then you came back. do you feel like you've been playing better tennis coming into the event?
what is the difference between top 10 player level and your level at this moment?
when you come back from a broken wrist, what is the most difficult thing to recover in your game?
did you feel something maybe click in cincinnati?
you have a lot of points to defend till the end of the year. are you anxious for your ranking?
how do you estimate your chances to be back in london in the masters?
what's your coaching situation right now? how much of a role, if any, does your wife have in it?
are you taking applications?
question about richard gasquet. do you think he can go back in the top 10?
how much did the second rain delay affect you?
did you feel uncomfortable approaching the net today?
on your forehand, you had 15 unforced errors. actually more than your backhand unforced errors, which is kind of surprising. anything going on specific with the forehand today?
not a lot of aces today. do you attribute that to him knowing your serve a little bit and knowing where you're gonna go?
how do you feel health-wise going into the open? i know you were suffering from a little bit of mono.
you mentioned his first serve wasn't doing anything much, but you only won four points on his first serve all day. what was going on with that?
in terms of your game, what do like about what you're doing into the open, and what do you need to improve on?
what do you do during the one-hour delay?
was mardy there with you?
is the fan support you get here consistent with what you get around the u.s. and around the world?
del potro pulled out of the open today. how do you see the field heading into the open? a really wide open field this year.
on a positive side, you only had four double faults the whole match. that has to make you pretty happy.
timing may not be great.
since your coach wasn't here this week, what did you tell yourself during the second rain delay to turn yourself around?
how did you get yourself back into the match?
what do you do during that really brief delay in the second set when you were in the locker room?
you talked a little bit about your serve. you only lost four points on your first serve the whole night, or afternoon. seems to be much improved. what did you do to change it?
46%.
how is the ankle?
how's the beard? is that a tournament beard, a tournament-winning beard?
can you think anything differently that you've done in the last two matches with andy? because prior to that you lost like nine straight.
do you think that's because of your weight loss?
after you won atlanta, i notice there's a commentary on the si website. fish may surpass roddick as america's best tennis player. what is your comment on that?
he does just say himself actually just now, that for the us open, that in the group of guys behind the guys who usually are in the mix, you have put yourself in the conversation i think is the words he used. do you feel like that yourself?
you've said you thought your extra weight has led to maybe more injuries in the past.
how much has the athleticism, equipment advances, length of the season, power, speed, and more events on hardcourts, how does it contribute to the wear and tear on your body?
your tiebreak record this season is 7 to 4. what are key factors in...
any preference on who you play tomorrow?
talk about the match tomorrow in terms of specifics, what challenges does baghdatis' game present to you as well as federer's?
how do you combat him mentally, i guess, because he's such a dominant player so that you don't lose the match before you even start?
i know you talked earlier in the week about the weight loss. have you been surprised by how much of an effect it's had on you? people must have mentioned it to you before. it can't be the first time somebody has said to lose some weight.
it looks like you're heading into seeding territory for the us open. how important is that to your game and to your confidence.
what are you most happy about in your game right now and what things do you really want to improve between now and the us open?
what do you want to improve on, specifics of your game.
more than 40 unforced errors. was that the key?
was his serve a lot better than you were expecting? you only got seven points off his first serve all night. that's kind of low for you.
were you a little disappointed by your net cord play? looked look you didn't finish some points at the net on a short ball, for instance.
so today it was a mental problem you think?
the forehand errors you talked about, was that more as a result of just playing aggressively?
you are going to train with toni very soon?
do you think the matches that you had in toronto and cincinnati are enough preparation to go into the us open feeling comfortable?
can you talk about how you felt and the conditions.
how long will it take you to recover from this physically?
going through there, you're trying to obviously manage your time or your energy in the third set tiebreak. you were trying to push and make a run there. was it 5-all where you missed, almost barely missed the pass on the forehand side? do you remember that point?
okay. what are you trying to get through there at that moment?
do you feel like you've had enough matches? even though you didn't win the tournament...
did you get a sense of fish's level, his improvements?
was there a point where you were thinking about whether you could continue on?
what do you tell yourself when you're approaching that physical wall to fight through it, the fatigue?
you were saying yesterday that you wanted, if possible, as late as possible. you were out there again early. were you disappointed with the scheduling?
have you ever made requests like that here in the past?
did the organizers give you any explanation?
and you had that discussion with them?
in hindsight, has it been a useful week for you, are you a bit more tired?
going forward it's pretty difficult obviously. you won last week and this is another 1000. would you like to see a week in between spacing these two out?
where will you spend the next week?
you feel like you survived something out there? pretty grueling match:
midway through the set on his service game, at 2-3, his second serves were coming in at 85, 73, and his first serves for one service game at 3-4 were 101, 109. was that throwing you off at all?
congratulations on your win. what was the message that you inscribed on the camera at the very end?
as you were giving hugs to the crowd, what thoughts were going through your head?
the fact that you're still alive in doubles, is that a good or bad thing in terms of preserving your energy for tomorrow's match?
3-0 against him now this year. can you put your finger on a specific key for that success?
first game of the match you hit a dropshot winner, and he gave you a stare down. you kind of looked over like, what's going on? i noticed that. and then even at the changeover he appeared to say something. was something going on right out of the gate with him?
to me, it seemed like maybe a big difference today. i don't know if it's something you've been doing all summer, but you seemed to control the tempo of the match really well. every time you were going through your routine. when he would serve, the ball would come to your side, you were kind of really able to control everything. just elaborate a little bit on this, if that was a focus or not.
you didn't play after newport last season, so will you have plenty of chance to improve your ranking.
could you please tell me how you're looking forward to this, and also your playing schedule in asia.
i appreciate it is difficult for you to answer because you're still involved in the doubles, but do you have empathy for andy and the fact that he's played a lot of matches in the last little while in the heat? he was saying earlier that he asked the organizers for a later start and it didn't happen. obviously he's exhausted now.
you broke him early right out of the gate in the second set. really appeared as if he was conceding the set to conserve energy for the third. may not have looked that way and felt it. how do you play someone like that, almost like someone with an injury? is it harder to play that way?
an unexpected day off yesterday. would you have rather had that rest or played after a full week of tennis last week?
he's won two of the last three matches against you, but you've dominated the series. was there anything you did differently in light of those two losses that you used in the match today against him?
it's really nice to see you play great this year, because your result in cincinnati during odd and even years is so drastic. do you feel strange sometimes? why is that?
the only part of the game you struggled in was breakpoints. did he do anything differently when you had a breakpoint against his serve?
would it be strange to play rafa and not have a title? it's a semi.
was today's match just a little easier than you were expecting?
do you think his level was lower today than some of the other matches?
i know you like to get to venues early. obviously new york is coming up. when are you gonna get to new york?
speaking of new york, any thoughts on serena dropping out of the open today?
yeah.
it's a loss to the tournament though, don't you think?
in the event that you face nadal tomorrow, i think you have a lead on him on hardcourts.
what's the key to trying to beat nadal? you've played him really close.
you talk about a racquet technology earlier in the week. i play with blx roger federer racquet. how big the difference between the racquet we got and you got?
i thought you had a much heavier racquet.
what was the big thing you changed from the other six times you played him and you had lost. what did you change tonight?
62.
on your second serve return, what were you doing to be so effective to win those points?
yeah, what were you doing.
was it difficult to close the match the last game?
talk about the match tomorrow and roger. last time you played him you beat him. is he more beatable this year?
couldn't get a better confidence boost before the us open to beat the world no.1.
how long have you been on that level with no aches and pains?
on your serve, you saved six of eight breakpoints. what did you do when you were facing a breakpoint against your serve that helped you save it? did you slow it down? put different spin?
did you watch how murray played him in toronto at all?
sort of. you went at his forehand a little bit more.
you had a couple of animated discussions with the chair umpire tonight. was that about him not overruling when he should've?
yesterday was solid; today was -- fill-in the blank.
yesterday was solid; today was?
when was the last time you would have felt as well about how you played as you did today?
with respect to being on the sidelines for a little bit of an extended period of time, you had a night match tonight, and obviously a day match tomorrow. any concerns about the quick turnaround time?
what does a match like this do for your confidence, not only for the rest of this tournament, but going into the us open?
talk about robin's serve. obviously he serves as hard as you do. it didn't look like he was mixing it up maybe as much as you; is that a true assessment?
sounds like a silly question, but you have a one-two combo with your first and second serve, maybe the best on tour, why do you and other guys take something off the second serve simply to get it in knowing that you've then reduced your chance of winning the point? we've actually crunched the numbers, and it actually comes out the other way sometimes.
but you're winning 75% of those points.
talk about your next match tomorrow against djokovic. i think you're up in career head-to-heads. he's got some physical issues, respiratory, that might affect the match.
i was thinking though that he'll be about as depleted as you are, so it might be more of an even match.
third set, soderling serving at 3-4; he got into a love-40 hole; he bounced back, got it to deuce, and then he had another breakpoint at that point, so four chances gone by the wayside. didn't convert. but what was your thought process going into your service game at that point?
so in this the end, such a small difference in the entire match. that third set tiebreak, is it really just luck, or is it you just taking the right points at the right time?
is there anything that you're not happy about with the match tonight that you want to improve on you're your next match?
even in general?
do you have a recommendation on the challenge rule?
what happened in the third set where you broke him three times? was he doing anything different? seemed lie it was easier to break him in the third set.
julien said that the key to his success in the first two sets is his return. sometimes even to your first serve. do you feel so? do you try to adjust?
when you were younger, did you practice a lot on faster surfaces, maybe more so than maybe your peers?
it seems that you brought at least the best point down - the match point at the very end of the tiebreak, seemed like you really started to get the intensity, the focus, and the hitting was also at the best. what do you think about that?
do you think that moment though that your game maybe turned right there?
you have a really dominating record against marcos. you've never lost to him in six previous matches. why do you think your game matches up so well with him?
do you think there's anything that have to do specifically well against him tomorrow?
quite a few players have pulled out of games or have not been able to finish games or are getting blisters or hurt or are complaining about being tired. what do you think is going on? is particularly difficult here, or it's just coming after one week's action?
how are you feeling yourself going through three sets?
you mentioned that you're gonna have to be a little bit more aggressive against baghdatis. do you feel that...
i guess what i meant to say is do you feel you played aggressive enough? or looking back maybe in the first couple sets, do you think you wanted to play more aggressive but necessarily you didn't?
fans are really hoping to see a rafa/roger semifinal. do you miss playing roger? you've only played him three times in the last two years.
coming back to julien benneteau, he's only 32 in the ranking. were you surprised by his level of play today?
you look exhausted after your last two matches. do you have a concern for your next match in terms of physical conditioning?
can you request that?
any indication they will give that to you?
if that continues through the week, could that affect you going into the open?
what do you do to recover from matches like this?
what was your thinking about ratcheting your serve down a little bit?
was it after you saw the stats go up on the board?
you play great without a coach. can you compare a little bit what's the main difference playing with and without a coach?
obviously you won the tiebreak today. before today's match, your tiebreak record is 5-11. what's your take on that?
you next play mardy fish, and the series is tied 3-3. he's beaten you the last two matches. what do you need to do to win?
talk a little bit about your photo shoot in rome, i think. it's much tougher than hitting tennis balls?
did you feel like in the second set anything kind of changed for you to harness momentum after coming out with the loss in the first set?
talk a little bit about the right shoulder injury, when it flared up, you know, what happened.
so have you had an mri or is it scheduled?
have you had any injuries in that shoulder before?
are you disappointed you won't have your match against federer?
did you inform roger personally, or did you talk to him?
so they don't know if it impacts your status for the open yet?
what do you think the difference was today in your match? it was very close.
the overhead in the tiebreak, was the sun in your eyes or were you affected by anything?
your return game also looked like it might have been a little bit off. was his serve doing anything unusual?
you really started off well against murray. did you feel he was a bit sluggish to start the match?
you've had a bit of an up and down. your results were starting to come back in the spring, and then i think you missed wimbledon. how are you feeling now about your game? is it starting to come back?
i thought you looked pretty good today.
what do you want to improve upon as you get ready for the us open?
also, your breakpoints converted, you were just 3 of 9 today. was anything in particular going on there that made that difficult for you to convert?
initially you looked a little jumpy out there, testy maybe, really trying to get the break, searching for it. at some point, maybe 3-all, 4-3, at that point you started to calm down a little bit and you got into a real good spot. explain what...
would you call it sort of the zone on your service games?
what steps do you take to get there?
murray/gulbis, any preference?
is being here in the final the last two years making you really want to win this tournament more?
i'm gonna ask you about second serves for a story i'm working on. what do you do differently on your second serve? what's different about it, and why not just hit your first serve a second time?
we've crunched a bunch of numbers, and you're one of i think six or eight players in the top 20 who over the long term would actually win more points on the second serve if you just hit it like your first serve. now, of course, that doesn't take into account the different situations, the emotion of double fault.
are players afraid of double faults? what's so bad about a double fault necessarily? if you're gonna serve a ball and chances are you're gonna lose the point anyway...
in the tiebreak, it was obviously a lot hotter out and the conditions were a lot hotter than it was when you first started. were you getting concerned about possibly going into the third set in the heat and that having an affect on your respiratory?
with nalbandian, he impressed a lot of people winning a couple weeks ago, was it d.c.? and then last week he lost early. people are talking about him as a contender for the us open. do you think he's back to that level?
is the ice from an injury today, or is this normal after a match?
even though you lost today, you showed people how to defeat nadal. what kind of things do you think you did correctly in first two sets?
also talk about match point. you could have won in two sets.
late in the first set, you found yourself at 15-40, and also very late in the second set. can you share a little bit about what you were looking to do on those points to win against him?
you are in your best personal ranking in both singles and doubles. how could you be your best self in relatively late age?
no, no.
what was will key difference between the first and second sets today? looked almost like two different matches.
the speed of the courts here compared to toronto, a lot players have been saying they've been playing a lot faster. this was your first match here in cincinnati. can you elaborate on the differences between two big hardcourt tournaments back to back, but yet different speeds?
consistent?
when you're in a match, what are some things that you say either to yourself or to the crowd or the with the fist pumps? what do you do to get through a match, to either stay in it or get through it?
your return points, you did very well on the return. the first serve in the 30%, and the second serve in the mid-60s winning percentage when he was serving. speak about that, about your return today. i think it was improved.
when you're playing such a big server like taylor, what adjustments do you make in your return game? you broke him four times today, and you were only broken yourself once.
do you stand further behind the baseline?
going back to the previous question about the speed of the court from toronto and here, which of these two is more comparable to new york?
a what's your inspiration to do your best, give your best when you're out on the court?
when you have some free time during a tournament, what are some things you look to do off-court visiting cities?
if you're in another city, some of the other ones...
there's nobody playing on the circuit today that was even born the last time there was no american ranked in the top 10. is that bad for the overall health of tennis, not to have an american in the top 10?
do we need an american to be among the top players then, maybe the top 3 or 4? like when you were growing up there was agassi and sampras, and we don't have that now.
i just wonder if you worry about losing the casual tennis fan, not the hard-core tennis fan.
your next match is against benneteau, and you haven't played him in five years. talk about his game, what have to do well, and the challenges of playing someone you haven't played in a long time.
could you talk us through the second set. seemed to maybe lose a bit of concentration perhaps.
when you say uncomfortable, physically uncomfortable? was there something bothering you?
the court conditions you mentioned here are much quicker here compared to toronto. what is it like it new york in comparison to these two?
which is your preference of the three?
how long does it take you before you start feeling comfortable on a different surface?
is a player like that particularly hard to find your rhythm against, somebody who's playing that sort of ultra-aggressive?
you've got gulbis next. how do you see that one?
another big win. you're close to the 32 spot. talk about the match a little bit.
do you think it's a little more than luck? you're 15 and 3 on in tiebreakers.
can you elaborate a little bit on what your doubles play has brought to your game and how much more doubles you're gonna play in the future going forward.
where a few of your favorites places to dine in the cincinnati area?
i do.
any other places besides embers, maybe not just this year or...
a little bit about richard gasquet? you're 0-2. i think you played last in '08.
do you attribute your demeanor out there in relative to you're not getting upset as much as maybe you would in the past. you're not riding the roller coaster. you're kind of just keep going.
so it's easy?
turning back the clock the last two, three months, was there a particular match or result that really you felt great about and couldn't wait to get back out there again?
i'm doing a story on the ball boys and ball girls here, and i've been asking them who their favorite players are. your name comes up every time.
what do you think of the ball boys and balls girls here, and what is your own personal philosophy in dealing with them?
who inspired you when you were a ball boy who you thought was a nice player and treated you well?
your first serve percentage kind of dipped from the first to second set. was that maybe his level increasing a little bit or did you have a slight drop off there?
is it possible to win one of these hardcourt tournaments without a really big serve?
is your serve as hard as it used to be before you made whatever changes you made?
you're return game looked really strong today. was that a particular point of emphasis for you coming into the match, where you knew you had to return well?
i asked you yesterday a couple times about respiratory problems. the mcenroes were just on a telecast talking about who they like in the us open. one of them mentioned you, but then said, of course, he has that respiratory issue. so you don't have a respiratory problem?
but it's just connected to heat is what i'm trying to get at, it's not a regular walking around thing?
how were the conditions out there today? do you think that may have contributed to the second set being so much tighter?
this was your first match again him. talk about his game and what he does well and not so well in the context of the match tonight?
sam had mentioned that he's gonna cut back on 250s going forward next year. are you going to look to revamp your schedule going forward to just play the bigger tournaments?
when did you stop feeling completely whipped from that match?
you felt more tired in d.c. than you did for the second-round match in wimbledon?
was there anything in particular tonight that you were working on, particular shots that you were working on? and also, what do you want to work on for your next match against nalbandian?
nalbandian won i think close to 60% of his return games in washington on his way to the final there.
he's one of the best returners on the tour; you're known as one of the better servers. do you think that makes your service games more important or his service games more important?
almost two months removed from wimbledon, are things slowing down for you, all the outside extra requests, fans, things like that slowing down?
did the officials at wimbledon mention that they were gonna try and put that match on dvd? not that you want to watch it, but...
you talked in d.c. about being sort of sick of talking about the wimbledon match. do you think you're over that feeling now? you've already talked about it a lot today.
your route to being a pro was much different than so many others with the years you spent at georgia. can you elaborate a little bit on that time you spent there and how that prepared you for where you are today?
what did you like most about the changes they made to the facilities here, and also the format next year with the combined event with the women?
what do you like most about it?
your success at wimbledon obviously brought you international fame, but speaking just from tennis fans in america, now that andy roddick has dropped a little out of the top 10, do you feel a lot of pressure on yourself that a lot of the people are looking at you and sam querrey as the next guys to make it into the top 10 for the u.s.?
going back to your schedule, i saw a little while ago you committed to the hopman cup. you were talking about 250s before. obviously auckland is one of the 250s that you won. have you made a decision about coming back to auckland?
what kind of dog?
name?
no bulldog?
how many events you gonna play with sam on doubles?
do you guys see yourselves as eventually maybe succeeding the bryans?
even years down the road?
you're a big georgia bulldogs supporter obviously. what do you think their chances are of winning the sec in football this year?
would you say the experience of playing doubles has helped you with your singles play?
in what way?
does that make you more comfortable approaching the net? first set, for instance, you won three of the four net points that you made approaches to do it. is that also another part of your game that you're trying to diversify instead of just hanging behind the baseline?
did you ever any concerns after wimbledon about somewhat longer term problems with your shoulder after having served so many days in a row?
mono or that, which one felt better?
didn't you have mono last year?
both of you served exceptionally well today. lots of aces and very few double faults; return games were solid. what was the difference?
you're having a great year this year, and obviously a lot of that is attributed to your fitness program. we all know the shelf life of a tennis player is only so long. do you have any regrets about maybe not getting on this program about five years earlier?
what did you do to lose the 30 pounds, and how has it affected your mobility?
you've had a lot success here. one year you played the finals, the championship. what is it about cincinnati that you tend to play well here specifically?
what do you think of the facility improvements?
what do you like most?
give your rise in the rankings right now, with respect to that, are you going to look to maybe make some changes to your schedule next year, maybe play some larger tournaments instead of some 250s?
how is your health doing after the week off from the beginning of summer with the ankle?
i don't know if it is quicker conditions out here, but the ball is really moving through the court when you're going after it.
are you happy with your movement? as a function of your weight loss, what other things specifically in your game has that weight loss helped you with?
do you have any rankings goals for the end of the year? talk a little bit about your schedule, too.
what you did change about you diet to lose the weight?
is there something that you miss that you gave up?
you're not like slobbering on the window or anything, are you?
you didn't look like you felt well on the court today. were you feeling ill?
do you feel like you're opponent did anything better or special, or it just wasn't your day today?
did you have any lingering injuries that bothered you today at all?
will you be playing in next week's tournament?
what kind of preparation will you do for the upcoming tournament?
do you feel like the change in coaching made any difference in your game at all, either negative or positive?
when was the last time you would say you felt somewhere close to 100% physically?
so for two years there's always been something niggling somewhere in your body?
are you giving yourself any kind of timeline as far as if it the injuries keep going on and the play doesn't get up to the level, any expectations or anything like that?
do you still believe in yourself?
in addition to putting in the practice time after the open, there are obviously some 1000 tournaments overseas after the us open. would you consider playing some doubles with a good partner?
a couple weeks rather than a month or two?
did you ever get an apology from pam shriver or anyone else?
from her?
what did stakhovsky do differently in this match that he didn't do the first time you played him?
how were you able to recover so well in the third set after being up 5-4 in the breaker, had the match on your racquet...
5-2 even, sure. but having the chances to close it out and then not doing it, but you coming out so strong right after.
set point first set and 5-all tiebreaker you came to net both times and you didn't get the point. is that something that you're working on with larry, to come to net a little bit more or at crucial junctures of the set?
you tee'd off on his second serves. at one point, 60% of your second returns. did he do anything different on his second serve that he didn't do on his first?
aside from speed.
that 6-1 in the third set suggested that the mono wasn't a problem.
third game of the match, first-round match, come on. you had about a dozen tonight. was this in your mind a little bit bigger match than maybe expected to get so involved very early on?
talk about the ridiculous shot at 3-0 in the third set. that was an unbelievable shot to break.
good shot?
did you lose any weight with mono?
is there any danger in exercising heavily when you have it?
we saw the braces on your ankles tonight. how are they feeling after your first match?
13.
you've had a lot of success on the court in cincinnati. what are some of the top things you like to do when you have some free time off the court?
t.o. was here tonight.
did you get a chance to talk to him at all?
your next opponent is de bakker. you played him in indian wells and you got him 4 and 4. he actually out-aced you that day, and i came away from that match telling people, i just saw andy roddick play a version of andy roddick. it really looked like you were playing yourself when you played de bakker. what are you gonna do different against him this time?
has your backhand gotten a little bit better? it looks like he was targeting that a little bit more this match.
did you feel as dominant as you looked out there today?
obviously fatigue from last night's late doubles match seemed to really impact your game a lot.
are you going to watch the match that will determine your next opponent?
dolgopolov.
talk your next match in regards to who you play. ferrer you've played once; you beat him. you've never played dolgopolov. just talk about both people's games and how you match up.
you've won four 250s this year, yet you said you're really looking to concentrate on the larger tournaments. with respect to that, next year are you gonna look to defend those titles or take some rest and go for the larger ones?
in your match with ferrer in auckland, looked like your return game was off that day. you only 12% of your first serve points.
his first serve, right. on your returning game?
the reason i ask is that obviously you have to focus your return game with him. does his serve give you problems?
how difficult at this level is it to play someone that you've never played before if you end up playing dolgopolov?
with an american falling out of the top 10 recently, how did you view that? do you sort of the feel like, hey, i'm a part of the future? i got to get us back there. what are you thoughts on that?
how many tournaments are you planning on playing doubles with john going forward?
you've had a lot of the real highs , but a couple of - like the french open, the other side of it. do you look back at that as a scheduling issue for you?
do you get particularly angry when things aren't going right?
it seems like the topic of the future of american tennis is always a topic, influx and transition. do you almost feel like it's almost unfair that people are waiting for the next agassi, sampras? what are your thoughts on that whole thing?
has there been any thought that and you john might eventually replace the bryan brothers, like especially in davis cup in doubles. what are your thoughts on that?
i heard you had a lot of your family members with you in england, and obviously you won queen's and then carried that into wimbledon. are you looking to duplicate that again next year, or maybe a big australian trip with the family? it seemed to do you a lot of good.
in your match with petzschner today, the first time you played him last year in montreal you lost. what do you did differently today? you mentioned serve. is there anything else?
pau gasol wanted me to say hola to you. congratulations. can you compare this to what he did, back-to-back lakers championships and your own as well, two straight here at wimbledon for you?
is it even more special for you to come back and win it a second time?
how does it feel to be so popular with the crowd here at wimbledon?
did you expect a different or tougher match from him?
you had a lot of support from home, your girlfriend, parents, people from your club. is that important to you?
how have you changed your game to become so comfortable on grass where you now have two wimbledon championships?
how hungry are you regarding winning the us open? how important is it for you to win the us open, as well?
you're known for playing all the points with great intensity and focus. it seems on the critical points, like today at the breakpoints, you really focused, you lift your game. can you talk about what you do on the big points.
you talked before about the importance of the movement. even if you don't like to speak normally about injuries, you still run like a rabbit or a jaguar, it depends what kind of animal you think. how do you explain it? you talk about knees, this and that. nobody is capable to run like you.
is there a special practice you do to be quicker than somebody else, to react?
did you expect this kind of return?
today lorenzo won in motorcycle. spain is in the semifinal of the world cup. you won here. what is so special in spanish athletes? if spain reaches the final, will you go there to see it?
and lorenzo?
will you go to the final, cape town?
you surprised some people with your summersault at the end. is that something you thought through or did spontaneously?
winning the french and wimbledon back to back, it's been said, is the hardest thing in tennis. you've now done it twice. how special do you think that is as an achievement?
the way you played in the clay court season, to be able to transfer that to grass, how tough is that?
you mentioned you were a bit nervous. was it different playing here? you played three finals against roger. was it different today playing as the favorite?
this year tennis fans remember this championship for your win, but also isner and mahut. what message do you have for them?
how good was rafa today?
we all know what makes rafa so good on clay: his movement and his spin. what are the most difficult things about his grass court style of play?
can you talk about what your game strategy was going in and how you tried to vary it as it played out.
do you consider at this time nadal the best and federer behind him?
what are your thoughts about the differences between the two of them right now?
there's only one slam that nadal hasn't won yet: the us open. what are your thoughts about his game on the hard courts at the open?
do you consider him the favorite at the open?
you're disappointed now, but you've had a superb tournament. you beat federer; you beat djokovic; you've had had a good season. do you feel differently about your game now? what are your aims going forward? do you think you can become a fixture in the top five as your game should allow you to be?
what's been the difference for you this year?
is it difficult to appreciate what you've done in the last couple weeks right now because of the disappointment, or do you feel inside it's been a great run?
what was the wind like today?
how did it affect things?
do you think the size of the occasion affected the way you played?
even though your first serve was a bit slow to get going?
what will you learn from this?
you proved that you're great on clay; you're great on grass; your game is probably best suited to hard court. what have you got ahead for the rest of the season from that point of view?
are you going to bastad as planned?
looked a little like 2008 again.
because of all of what you had to go through last year with the injuries, is it even more satisfying now that you're back here?
does 2008 seem like a long time ago when you were here raising the trophy as the champion, or does it seem like yesterday to you?
you were behind 4-2 in the last set and you weren't playing very well then. suddenly you win the rest of the games as you became rafael nadal again. did you have to wake up?
it will go down as a straight-sets victory today, but how well did andy murray play?
was it fun meeting beckham?
did you talk a little soccer?
can you compare meeting the queen of england and the king of british football?
was it hard to recover from the double-fault mentally?
what about andy, you said to him after the match that he could win a major.
how well aware are you that he's such a big fan of yours? he kept talking about you're his favorite player to watch.
do you remember where you were the first sunday of july last year? did you watch the final?
what are the recollections you have from that day? what else do you remember about the final last year, not being there?
in view of andy's skill, were you surprised that you were able to close this out in just three sets?
looking back now, does it surprise you you were able to complete this match so quickly?
during the tournament we have found out from other players that they have been injured going into games. we found out after the game. do you go into sunday's final a hundred percent fit? your knees are ready to go?
did you have a chance to watch your opponent in the finals?
what do you think about tomas berdych?
your feelings about the matchup against berdych in this particular match on grass, is there a style that you're expecting to see from him or what?
if you have to give a technical explanation why you won today, do you think it's your forehand that was the big difference? your forehand kills the point while murray is a very good counterattacker, but it doesn't have the same power when you slow down the ball and you slice your backhand.
we've had three classic finals in a row here. do you expect to give us a fourth one sunday?
your thoughts on that?
did you feel you got into the rhythm of your own game during the match?
when he hit that the double-fault in the tiebreaker, i mean, it as a bit of a shocker. did it throw you off?
with all that was at stake today, how does this compare to what could have been for you in this tournament?
what was the game plan against him?
was it also about targeting his backhand particularly?
nadal played a stunning match. is that any consolation now, or will it become one in the future?
is that the best he's ever played against you?
who do you pick in the final, rafael or berdych?
talk about the extra weight on your shoulders because of trying to win it for the home team here.
what are you going to do now?
when you look back at tennis tournaments as a whole, are you pleased taking this result out of it, that you're improving, heading in the right direction?
does it strengthen your result to one day come back and win a slam, or does it spur you on in moments like this?
after the australian you found it difficult to sort of get back into it straightaway. are you concerned it might happen again after this result?
in what ways, if any, has nadal changed his game since you played him in australia?
is there a frustration factor out there when you play a lot of really good tennis and somehow it just keeps coming back?
i know you've only just come off court, but where does this one sit with your other disappointments?
you're good at opening up the court, playing far back. is that a particularly tough strategy to pursue with him, given his skill set athletically?
you again had great support today from fans who will be looking forward to you coming back next year. what will you say to them?
you had a couple of conversations with the chair. were you unhappy about the time he was taking?
what did rafael say to you after the match?
if you could somehow go back and change one thing about the match, what would that be?
is it annoying to have to wait so long to receive serve?
coming off court, rafa said he thought you'd win a slam and win one soon. what does that mean to you when someone you respect so much has got some faith in your ability?
what went wrong for you out there today?
will those double-faults play on your mind as you go home, do you think?
were you actually nervous or was there something about the thought of getting to the final?
talk to us about that point at 5-6 where you put the lob in and the line judge called it out. were you quite put off by that call?
did he give you a code of conduct warning at the changeover?
for racquet abuse?
must be frustrating for you. you were so close and it's not happened for you today.
maybe wasn't so much attention on your side of the semifinals as obviously the british guy. do you think berdych can sneak through and take the title on sunday?
has he changed since the last time you played over a year ago?
what are you going to do now? you have a break or something?
any kind of breathing trouble you had in the last round today?
on a scale of one to ten, how will describe your match today? where do you place your match?
what does it feel like to be in the final?
you beat federer and djokovic in successive games. you are fear no one now?
did you feel your performance improved today compared to your performance in beating federer?
are you surprised at all considering the importance of that match that you were able to do it in straight sets, though?
did what happened to you in the semifinal in paris make you more determined if you ever got in that position again that you wouldn't waste the chance?
what is the key to your grand slam success now at the age of 24?
did you feel mentally or physically stronger than in the past years? do you sense there's a difference in you?
you talk about the same tactics going up against no matter who you play, but on sunday you're gonna have two different styles. is there a way you're looking at each individual yet, how you might face them?
with the way you are playing now, don't you see yourself as becoming the wimbledon champion on sunday?
are all your family gonna be here? anybody coming over now to watch you in the final?
this is your first grand slam final. do you think all these years you have been an underperformer with your game, because people are talking about you have the game to be really good?
do you think all these years you have been an underperformer up to this stage?
are you a good sleeper, and do you expect to be sleeping well the night before or will it just be another day as far as being able to relax?
do you have a hobby outside of tennis?
have you worked specifically on your movement over the last few years? it appears that you're much faster and that your balance is a better on your shots.
who was your sport idol when you were a kid? does ivan lendl mean something special to you? did you used to watch him playing an television?
when did you first feel like you were ready to win a grand slam?
was there a moment this year - you've had a very consistent year - maybe a match or a set or a week where you felt like this could be a really special year for you?
coming back to lendl, did you ever talk to him?
you said you were tired. do you have any major issues with your body at the moment, or is it okay?
it was a brilliant start for you. what will you say went wrong for you or what went right for nadal?
how was your left foot? you received some treatment at the end of the third set. was that hampering you a bit?
so it's no reason...
did you think it would be more politic to wait until the end of the set, given he was about to serve?
do you think you rushed the first set?
do you think you rushed the first set, you were in a hurry?
at the start of the second set you successfully challenged the call. rafa was quite upset that he lost that point. do you think that kind of fired him up that he improved after that?
you had points on a lot of his service games. i think he had very few when he saved to love. do you feel he was serving weaker than he has in the past or were you returning well, especially at the start?
do you think, like the ferrer match, take out of you some points of stamina? i mean, did you feel a little bit tired or not so confident after the ferrer match?
do you think rafa is playing as well this year as anyone? how does he compare, his level, as in the french open?
you say he has a good chance to win the tournament?
if you were to look back and check the rafa of 2007, the long match between you guys, and the rafa of today, what's the difference for you?
yes.
i take it would have known about the federer result. i think it was a bit after the first set. did that affect your match in any way because you saw he'd gone out?
that was some kind of slow start. how do you explain the slow start and the sudden turnaround?
you were upset about the overrule call there. what did the chair umpire say to you? how did he explain that? you seemed to start playing very well after that. you had a run of points. what happened there?
you seemed very fired up or angry immediately after that point. do you think it helped you, the call?
serving for the set, he took a medical timeout. were you surprised by his decision to do that at that moment? what's your feelings?
would you say it's appropriate to do it at that time?
how excited are you to be in the semifinals here again and the prospect of playing andy murray?
when did you find out that berdych had beaten roger and what was your reaction?
most top players say, i'm just going to play my game. i have my game, and that's what i worry about. but there's a big difference between soderling and murray in styles. when you go to play the semifinals, do you have to change a few things in your game?
i saw your mother and the ladies of your family here today. have you more family coming now for friday?
how are the courts playing? there's been no rain at all. how are the courts playing?
perfect?
just your conditions?
when you changed ends at 5-love in the first set, the scoreboard showed that roger federer was facing match point at the same time. did that register with you, or do you not pay any attention to that?
and if you did notice it, what did you think at that point, because he could have been out and you were facing a very nasty start?
did you feel like the improvements in the score line from the second set onwards was a result of soderling making more mistakes or you changing your game and improving different aspects of it or a combination of the two?
did you try to do something different?
how are you feeling physically? how is your physical condition?
do you think with roger losing at the quarters at the french open and here will get him more motivated for the us open, make it harder for you guys to beat him there?
can you talk about the first couple sets at the australian open against murray, which were at a very high level, and maybe how he was attacking you and how you tried to respond.
just how tough was it out there today?
were you surprised you played so well in the first two sets?
what are your thoughts on the keys to playing well against nadal?
how much have you seen of nadal here this year and what have you made of him?
do you feel different coming into this semifinal than you did last year?
do you take any sort of psychological edge after beating him in australia?
your odds are now 11-5 to win wimbledon, the shortest priced brit since fred perry.
the beard seems to be doing the trick. will you keep it on till the end of the tournament?
not affecting your aerodynamics or anything?
ben stiller was in the crowd today. i know said in the past you like will ferrell's movies. i think ben still is in that genre as well.
what would it mean to you to win this title?
the second-set tiebreak today, at 5-all when he left that backhand return, was that more surprise or relief on your part? maybe you thought that was going to be your day then?
how important was the support from the home crowd for you today?
you revealed late on monday night that you had had many messages of support and well wishes, one from david beckham. have you had any other notable messages?
how would you describe - for people who aren't from this country - what the whole atmosphere is like with the history that goes back to fred perry since the last champion?
how have you learned to deal with it?
in his post-match interview, jo tsonga is backing you to win the championships. can you talk about what he said to you at the net and what that means to you?
what did you make of federer's shock defeat? given he's beaten you in your two grand slam finals, do you feel his exit has improved your chances?
were you quite pleased in a way that federer is out?
your plans for the next 24 hours? what are you going to do to stay relaxed ahead of friday's match?
how is maggie? we heard she's not very well.
rafa was saying how the conditions are a bit like clay because it's so dry out there. do you think that could be an advantage for him?
you have family and friends watching you. any more people coming down from home?
you played so many times on centre court. what do you like the most about it?
do you think the crowd has a strong knowledge and following of the ebbs and flows of the match? does that in any way help you?
would it be different for you psychologically, because obviously this time you'll be going into the semifinals as the underdog, whereas last year you were the favorite? so how different is that?
have you spoken to tim? do you think he'll have any words of advice for a semifinal again?
how do you feel you played this afternoon?
was it a challenge, the sort of experience playing in the quarterfinals of a slam for the first time?
do you feel maybe you struggled at times to get into your rhythm to play your best tennis?
now you got to one grand slam quarterfinal. have you got more in you?
what aspects of your game do you think you have to improve to compete with guys like djokovic today?
how has your success here been greeted at home? is it on the news? are people interested back home?
you stood up very well to roddick's very powerful serve in the last round. today you seemed to struggle with djokovic. was there anything you were doing different?
difficult moment, but what couldn't you do that you wanted to do? what let you down?
you beat him almost every time you played him. was he any different?
how do those physical things affect you the most?
some of these big, flat hitters seem to be having an effect on you. do you need to alter your game to adjust to that?
when did you first start feeling the problems?
did it affect your level of motivation or anxiety about the match before the match or in the early stages of the match?
obviously he's going to come at you. did you feel like you were as aggressive as you wanted to be in the match? you had some chances in the fourth set, love-40 on his serve.
timing issues for you out there on the ball?
a number of shots were sailing out and the crowd would groan and then they would suddenly curl in. what role do you think technology had on today's result, strings in particular?
no. it looked like he was hitting balls that were going to land 10 feet behind the baseline and then they would curl in.
will this make you hungrier to make you come back and show you can lift this title again?
what concern do you have that the injuries will linger?
do you feel you can get back to a position of domination in tennis?
obviously a very disappointing day for you personally. who, in your opinion, do you think will go on to win this competition now?
which leg is the one bothering you?
do you think the return was the most difficult part of your game today? because sometimes you were returning a little slower and he was hitting a lot of winners.
will you shut yourself off from tennis totally now?
the prospect of a men's final without roger federer seems a strange one. will you tune in on sunday to see how it goes on?
andy murray is playing a critical match at the moment. nadal has been having some trouble. what do you think of andy murray as a player and do you think this might be his year, given some of the great players are not doing so well?
i wonder if you think this might be his year, given some of the really threatening players haven't been doing so well this year.
you looked excited by your performance today.
what were your thoughts when you heard that roger had lost?
can you describe the matchup in more detail against tomas, the strengths you need to try to exploit in your game and what you need to work on against him?
it's two years since you won a grand slam. do you think you're playing at your best now?
you expect a very difficult match in the semifinal. berdych in place of federer means for you a better chance right now?
you said the game has changed for you. you've been struggling for the last couple months. what has changed or turned the tide for you?
the last time you reached this stage at wimbledon, you were far from fit. are you a hundred percent now? are you looking forward to making up for that?
what does this opportunity at this stage of your career mean to you?
will it be more difficult to fall asleep tonight knowing that in the semifinal you have a bigger chance since you're playing berdych?
you played berdych twice. you never lost a set. it's a different berdych, the one that you have to play now. how different do you think he is?
and you spoke also about your personal problems or distractions. what were you meaning, apart from maybe the tournament in belgrade?
are you really surprised that berdych beat federer today?
are you a hundred percent fit going into the semifinals?
will you say you surprised yourself today?
roger said he had some physical problems; that his back and leg were bothering him. what did you notice and what is your reaction to him saying that?
he also said he was unlucky and that he definitely gave the match away. what are your thoughts about that?
he was saying generally or on big points.
the last game you went from having a match point to a breakpoint. it's a very difficult turnaround. you've only got one break. if he breaks you there, the set is even. what were you thinking at that point? was that a difficult situation to control for you?
the last set was a real adventure. sixth game, four breakpoints and two double-faults. how did you keep your cool?
how do you feel about roger after the things he said after the match?
with your game, we've been expecting big results for a while. what's changed in the last couple of tournaments that you've been able to pull off these kind of wins?
what are the keys to your next match?
there are two czechs in the semifinals. it's more or less 20 years since this has happened. is that a coincidence? is the czech tradition coming back somehow?
you don't get any particular help more from the czech federation than a few years ago? do you have any economical support?
can you talk a little bit about your relationship with kvitova, because you practice in the same club in prostejov.
how would you describe the moment when you won today, what you were feeling?
who came to support you? who was the first person to congratulate you?
your parents will come to england or no?
what was your game plan against roger? did you learn anything from your victory in miami that you used today?
you played djokovic twice and didn't win a set. it was quite a long time ago. have many things changed since then? are you more confident? do you think he can return better your serve than federer does?
are you happy with the way you're playing?
not sure of your next opponent. possibility it will be andy murray. how do you see that matchup?
how is your confidence just now?
what has made the difference this year with you feeling comfortable on grass?
and your back is fine now?
you seemed to be a little bit frustrated at times. was it because you weren't playing as well as you felt you should be?
congratulations. is this another important step in your career, reaching a quarterfinals at wimbledon?
do you feel your game on grass is improving?
this was a closer contest that your last three. is that just because the opponent was a higher standard? do you feel you played as well today?
how did you find playing on court 12. it's quite a small court. did you find that a distraction?
you haven't lost your service until now. he's probably one of the most underrated returners in the game. what makes him such a tough returner?
was that your main problem this time round? it was such a see-saw match. was it because of the serve or a loss of concentration?
you had a medical timeout. was that for anything serious?
there was an instant right at the end where it looked like you spotted the ball girl looking a little bit unwell and you stopped playing. could you talk us through what happened.
what happened to magnus?
you're a swede in the last eight at wimbledon. that will excite a lot of people. what are your memories of the swedes that came before you at wimbledon?
when you were growing up, which grand slam did you dream of winning?
obviously looks like you'll be up against nadal again. given your success against him in the past, you must relish that contest.
what was the key to your success against him in the past, do you think, that you have to reproduce?
are the courts to your liking? or if it were a little bit colder the ball would bounce a little bit lower, would you prefer it?
roger federer made an interesting comment. he was talking about the england/germany game, and said that the best players need to play the best players to bring the best out of themselves. is that something you can relate to?
what do you think about next round probably against nadal? he's winning. just one game.
better than today?
better than today.
always the fifth set in grand slams. do you dread the fifth set in a slam these days?
obviously a tough one. anything he did towards the end? is it just one of those things the ball bounced certain ways, shots went certain ways?
did you play as aggressively as you wanted to?
you've played him before. was he a new guy this time?
are you a bit stunned after something like this or just down?
after the fourth-set breaker, where he got a little bit nervous, you had a couple big serves, thought that maybe in the fifth he'd tighten up a bit. he hasn't been in that position. what were you expecting going into the fifth?
any reason why you felt you were down in the first three sets in terms of quality?
any reason why you were not hitting the ball that well in the first three sets?
was he controlling too much real estate where you couldn't get into net as many times as you wanted to?
there were patches in the match where you felt like he was reading your serve pretty well? you hit a lot of aces.
reasonably new court. does it play different to the other show courts here?
back to the returning. were you not reading him the way you wanted to or the ball wasn't coming off the racquet?
so tomorrow when you wake up, you think you're going to be pissed off, disappointed?
you've been through these slams before.
just talk about the match. what was the difference out there?
how is his level? i mean, you've obviously played a lot of good matches on grass. he hasn't lost a set yet in the tournament. is he playing that well?
what was it like out there, the atmosphere playing murray, centre court, wimbledon?
you've probably been asked this, but what did you learn from this match?
was there any fatigue issue given how much you've played on the grass?
what are the conditions like on the court? is it pretty fast? it's been hot and dry the last week.
what about the footing? is it grippy or slicker?
how does it compare with queen's.
what's next?
are you feeling any sympathy for murray given what the expectations are around him here? and how do you feel about the way he seems to actually step up and do well here even though he hasn't won yet?
thoughts on that one?
you haven't been having those wobbles. what happened when you were serving for the set?
is that part of the maturity you realized of accepting the fact you're not always going to be hitting what you want?
how do you feel now that england is out of the world cup and all the attention is swinging back to you as the sole british sporting hope at the moment?
you were pretty much better on every stat today, especially your second serve, winning 63%. it's a lot harder than last year. is that something you worked on?
you're the only guy not to drop a set in the tournament, which must be quite pleasing.
do you feel you're in the same groove as you were at the australian open?
with all the sun that's getting to the court, is it changing in your favor, do you think, the surface?
your third wimbledon quarterfinal in a row.
how much does it help you that you have been here before, third time in a row at this stage?
how tough will jo-wilfried tsonga be?
great reception from the centre court crowd. can you say something about that, how important that relationship is, how it's developed?
the noise, did that have an effect?
when are you planning to shave?
seems to be working for your tennis. might you keep it on till the end of the tournament?
what does it mean to have the two ladies in your box?
yes.
was it important to get back together with kim?
tsonga likes to work the crowd. that atmosphere which could be created by the both of you, is that something you were looking forward to at this point of the tournament? you've had some great reactions in various matches.
i remember you saying before the tournament that you thought you weren't too far away from rediscovering your best tennis. four matches in, not a set dropped, have you found it?
you played him twice before. what was the difference?
when it was leveled at two sets each, was it psychologically tougher for you then?
you didn't believe?
what were the emotions like for you after the match? you won, sat down in your chair. what was going through your mind after the victory?
may we ask when your father passed away?
so now having achieved the best result of your career, how far do you think you can go here?
is it true you call yourself randy because your english teacher could not pronounce your name?
do you want to know?
how long have you been working with mark woodforde and how much has he helped your game?
what was his advice? did you speak to him today?
did your father teach you to play tennis? was he involved in tennis?
when you beat andy murray at the beijing olympics, he said later that he was jetlagged and did not prepare properly. does that make this win the best of your career?
how difficult is it to play tennis in taipei? did you have economic support only from the family?
what was your family doing, your family business?
can you elaborate on that? was this like a chicken farm where your dad worked? did you work with him there?
they were wild?
roddick talked about how your serve seemed a lot tougher for him today than when you've played him in the past. is that a part of your game you've worked on specifically? how might you be a different player today?
two sets to love down, you came back, do you feel that was one that got away from you in the end?
could you tell there was anything wrong with him in that third set?
it was a surprise he actually called for medical assistance at that stage in the match?
must be pretty disappointed about the finish to your campaign?
physically, you came up all right at the end of the game? hip is fine?
the us open is the last slam of the year. your next big focus?
still think you got a chance you'll come back here and go a bit further? still think you can win this tournament again?
did you think you had the match in your control at 2-all when you broke back in the fourth set?
he said he was suffering from stomach cramps. has that ever happened to you, where you suffered, then regained your momentum later in the game?
did you change your tactics at all in the third set when you saw he was in trouble?
is it hard not to think that you'll be 30 when you come back here next year, the chances are slipping away? do you sense that?
are you a fan of this monday at wimbledon where all the singles players are on show?
how do you feel you played today?
do you feel you can intimidate opponents on this centre court because you know it so well?
any concerns about fitness at all? there was a photograph with some strapping on your thigh the other day. is that just precaution?
how does the hot and dry weather change the conditions of the courts?
how have slower courts and the heavier tennis balls contributed to the decline of the serve-and-volley game in your estimation?
what have you missed by having that contrast like sampras and agassi?
yesterday this country and the sports world were shocked by some problematic officiating, and there were very loud calls for electronic officiating. could you talk about how electronic officiating has evolved in our sport and would you call for it in soccer, especially at the goal line?
in our sport you feel it is best just to leave it in the hands of the linesmen and the chair umpire?
you came out missing a few first serves. how do you work on that as the match goes on?
did it hurt at all to dismantle melzer so easily and give him quite a beating since he's your friend?
you appeared to be breezing your way through that. what happened in the third set?
you didn't look well throughout that third set. would that be fair to say?
what was the shirt ripping about at the end?
could you tell us more about your stomach discomfort in the third set.
was it a muscle problem?
is it the heat, you think, that brought it on?
lleyton was asked, could you tell there was anything wrong with him in that third set, and he said, i don't know, he's always got something. what's your reaction to that?
could it have been something you'd eaten? was it that sort of problem?
we don't know yet who your opponent will be. if it is andy roddick, what are your observations of the way he's been playing this tournament, and how would you describe your matchup with him?
you obviously are very up on the history of the game. you've even done imitations of the great players in history. when you think about how the game has changed, even in the last 10 years, the demise of the serve-and-volley style, how much do you think the court speed and the weight of the balls has affected that?
what is the connection between the pace of the courts and the weight of the balls to that phenomenon?
you've lost to andy the last three times you played him. do you find him particularly mentally difficult to play?
back to the fourth set against lleyton. when he leveled at 2-all, were you thinking that you were in a bit of trouble there?
how long did it take you to put the us open incident with roddick behind you mentally?
what do you understand now more this year on the grass from last year or the last several months that's helped your game?
was one of the reasons why you changed the service motion was because your shoulder was hurting a bit and you were trying to relieve the pressure?
three rounds and you've not dropped a set yet. you must be feeling very confident about your game.
you're one of two players to have beaten both roger and rafa at grand slams, and obviously you've done that at paris. can you do it again here?
have you done anything different in your preparation between paris and coming here this year?
is this the best you've ever played on grass?
does the dry weather and the higher bounce help?
is your confidence at an all-time high now given how you've been playing?
can you explain what that feels like? if you sort of put the yourself to where you were a couple years ago, can you explain how different it feels when you step on court when you are so much more confident.
so does it make you more calm?
you broke rafa's roland garros streak and roger federer's semifinals streak. which achievement are you more proud of?
roger you beat on the 13th try, i think, and he has lost more than usual. is he more vulnerable right now? why? what's the main reason?
with roger and rafa having both been taken to five sets this year, is there a feeling that there's more of an opportunity for a group of players just behind them, such as yourself?
can you talk a little bit how you have to adjust to play a left-handed player? what is the main difference?
bjorn borg sees you as a future no.1. do you see yourself that way?
having beaten both of them and with their streaks, is it possible for you to put into words how much that's fueling the fire to break through against one of them in a situation like a grand slam?
what does an endorsement from someone like borg mean to you?
how has your life changed off court through this success?
you can still walk around unworried in sweden, or do people approach you all the time?
hard luck on your match to you. it's been a tough year for you injury-wise. how are you feeling now physically?
do you think if this match happened even a month or two down the road it would have been a lot closer? do you just think you needed another few weeks?
you must be looking forward then to the season from here on out just to get more match play and get back up to your top level.
just one more question. this is a question for your fans, because i tweeted on my page if they wanted to ask you one question. they say that you know robert patterson is the most famous man on the planet from twilight.
they say you look just like rob. do you ever get confused for robert patterson? it's a great compliment to look like robert patterson.
looking at your hair now, are you going to let your hair grow a little bit longer to get to r-pat's?
did you think you may have to come out monday for a moment there?
did the umpire say something to you three games before the end, i guess?
i thought he said something. it didn't have to do with the darkness then.
okay.
is there a sense that you're kind of racing the sun going down?
but does it affect the way you play? did you feel a little pressure that way?
how do you feel you played? it was kind of a strange fifth set. you had all those chances with the breakpoints and then serving for the match. but played very well in patches, too.
i think you had eight in a row that you didn't convert.
thoughts about facing andy murray?
when you know you've got andy murray to face, is that be extra motivation given it will be centre court and it will be the main draw for the british?
you may have answered this already, but to make this run to get is the second week of this great tournament, how does that feel?
when you served for the match the first time and got broken, did you think that darkness might be an issue? did you rush it at all because of that?
how dark was it?
was it a problem at all?
seemed it curl in.
was moving to centre court under the roof discussed?
have you played on centre before?
is there a point where the light kind of went on for you as far as playing on grass is concerned?
what advice did isner have for you this morning? i saw you in the village.
he doesn't want to talk about tennis at all probably.
if you get to the fifth, don't go 71-69.
did that thought go through your head at all at the end?
what's wrong with you? you couldn't take it to 70 games?
talk about you won't exactly have the home court advantage monday, but you've played some pretty big -- if i have it right, about 20,000 in madrid. what's it like to be playing with the home court crowd against you?
did your new commitment to a positive attitude help after the first set?
there was a lot sport for malisse out there today. does that help you sort of as a precursor to dealing monday perhaps with murray?
how much of it do you actually notice when you're playing?
yeah.
the cheering section you had last year in l.a., you can't bring them over to...
so when andy reaches the finals of the australian, it's sorts of an up-and-down, problematic stretch. until now, it's been pretty impressive here. has lots of game and different places to. he's comfortable out there. how do you attack him?
how important was this for your confidence and just mentally to pull it out, to give up the break and come back and win it and stick with it?
what's fun about it?
we just lost to ghana.
but you brought down one of belgium's fiercest players. do you think that will be a healing affect across the u.s.?
are you at all proud of yourself how you turned it around after the flack you took after paris?
so you seem pretty relaxed and almost confident. it's gonna be a tough match, but you're feeling good about the monday match?
do you remember playing him in the us open juniors?
what do you remember about that match?
what have you learned on these grass matches? have you made any adjustments? has anything become easier in the course of these eight matches?
aside from talking with your coach and probably resting and maybe a light hit, are you gonna do anything special. you won't speak to andy roddick who of course had a great win here last year in terms of andy murray? will you do anything special between now and the match?
didn't you lose your phone infamously once?
can we analyze first.
your timeout or...
are you suggesting there might have been a bit of gamesmanship involved there?
is that the only difference between a player like you and him, that he's clever enough to know when to take a timeout maybe?
you were complaining to the referee about the coaching by rafael with...
no?
did you hear it?
can you explain your game plan?
the reaction of rafa to the coaching warning was quite strong. again, sort of gesturing and talking back to the umpire. did that unsettle you at all?
i'm just asking if it unsettled you.
but some injury has to be, because he's going to quit davis cup. he said that, and we all knew that. he says he's not gonna play anymore until the u.s. season in august.
what, fitter than mahut?
you think so?
any thoughts on the match tomorrow, or you're not into football?
would that raise your spirits at all after today, or have no impact?
if they don't cheat? are you talking about '66?
i think it's gonna a miserable weekend for you double time then, huh?
what was wrong with your leg? i couldn't quite tell from the stands.
was it fair to be warned about coaching? you looked very angry.
after your incredible clay court season, now 13 sets in one week in wimbledon, how are you feeling right now emotionally and physically?
do you think it's taken you longer to settle in because it's been two years since you've been on grass?
you were saying something from the baseline to the umpire, shouting at him, gesturing at him. what were you saying to him?
and did you?
will you?
how much are you worried about your knee? is there a risk you should skip the davis cup tie after wimbledon?
philipp said you were running exactly the same before and after the timeout. he said you could have played another two or three sets. he said it was a clever timeout because it broke his concentration. what do you think about that?
how bad is your knee right now? you said you're scared. what are you scared of?
you did say a little while ago you were scared. what does scare you about the knee, maybe long term if not for this moment?
what special treatment?
can you finish the tournament? do you feel physically strong enough you can really mount a challenge and beat roger if the occasion comes?
was there something with your arm as well that the trainer was looking at?
even the best players are involved in tough battles early on. is this because it's very hot and it's hard to break serve? is there any other reason the best players are having trouble?
we know you're a big football fan, looking forward to spain and portugal. what do you think about england and germany tomorrow?
with all the ways your game depends on your legs, the power you get from your legs, with all these problems with your knees, does that affect you at all on court? do you think about it?
the player you played today said there are a lot of players coming up here better than they used to be. they give you a good chase at the moment. is that what you feel? are the players that challenge you now at the moment, are they better than they used to be?
can you clarify about how your arm feels now?
guess you couldn't have hoped for a better first week, could you?
was there a danger of almost rushing it?
that court that you're so successful on it, you're so dominant, how much do you think that gives you an edge, a court you like, crowd behind you?
are you getting the same sort of feeling now that you did at the australian open, building up to what was a terrific tournament in many respects?
what are your thoughts on playing sam on monday?
isner and the australian open, your game plan was excellent there. i know it won't be the same game plan, but it will be a similar game plan when you play sam?
that point in the seventh game of the third set when you both ended up on the floor, do you still get a thrill after all these years from moments like that?
do you remember playing sam querrey in the us open juniors in 2004?
are you even more confident now than you were a few weeks ago that you can actually go on and win this?
there were a few famous faces out there watching you. anyone you particularly picked out?
the football tomorrow, are you going to try to watch?
supporting england?
was there any significance in the red sweat band and white sweat band?
there were 14 members of the armed forces in the royal box. they got a great reception. most of them stayed to give you a great reception. how did you feel about that?
john...
how was the match?
john was complimentary in how you helped him. i'm wondering, what did it mean the way he played, what did it mean to you, to american tennis?
john mentioned that you helped him out wednesday night with some food. i'm wondering how that came about. were you around here and watching some, checked on him? you came back here?
today's match you looked particularly relieved at the end. was that really the case?
you seemed to pick up your game in the third and fourth sets. talk about that uptake.
what was your internal dialogue like during the changeover after letting that second set get away?
how do you approach the two days off? are you happy about that extra day's rest or would you rather keep it one day off and back to action?
which ticket do you pick, super saturday at the us open or super monday here?
what are the pros and cons?
no, as a fan.
yes.
how was acting in american pie?
are you serving now about as well as you can? did you feel out there like you were sort of in that rhythm of having your serve be at its best?
the english soccer team have a ban placed on their wives and girlfriends staying at the same hotel as them. in tennis, the wives play a huge part of the team. how important is the support of your wife at a tournament like this?
who do you think would win a wag-off between the tennis wags and the soccer wags?
that match obliterated every longevity record. why did that last so long?
did you know john had that in him spiritually as well as physically?
us open match flash through your head at all?
if you didn't have to play a tiebreaker, you might have been there a while.
16-14 was epic.
more generally, pretty wild first week if you're a spectator or one of us.
how much does that seep into the locker room? how much do you get a sense of the vibe?
wimbledon seems to be on steroids recently with the final with federer and nadal, then your final, and then isner. those are three of the most memorable matches in tennis history in a pretty close cluster.
a view on changing the final-set rule in terms of a tiebreak?
he was so worn out, obviously. i guess no one was really surprised what happened today after the three days.
do you think all the drama from the last week is just a credit to the players and shows how much wimbledon means to all the tennis players?
you mentioned there was a sense of relief getting through today. with a couple days off, what kind of mental reset do you undertake on monday?
putting aside the history and the freakishness of that match, what do you think of the aesthetics of that match?
how they were playing?
do you think with john's game he can get to slam finals with that power game that he has now?
are you planning your day around the world cup tomorrow? planning to watch the u.s.?
how come you were so sort of even and placid about nebraska leaving the pac-12?
what would you say was the biggest difference between today and when you beat roddick at the australian open?
after winning the second set there, you played a great game to hold serve at 5-4.
won the tiebreaker. was it a case of maybe letting up a little at the start of the third?
did he return maybe better than you remember him returning when you played in the past?
what did you think of the first match point, i think it was, the dive he made for that ball? a little crazy?
how much real sleep did you manage to get last night? how did you feel mentally and physically when you walked on the court today?
didn't really have a chance, did you say?
you said on thursday that you'd rather die than quit. did that thought ever cross your mind during those three sets today?
were you getting advice to quit? what was in the box they gave you at the end of the match the other day?
did you know when you woke up today that you just didn't have the energy to go out there and play?
were you at any stage jealous of an opponent whose final set in his previous round was only 16-14 rather than 70-68?
obviously this will be a few days that will forever change your life. what do you think you'll learn from this experience on the court and off the court?
in college tennis, did you ever have a case of exhaustion like you had today?
are you going to take a little bit of a break now?
looking into the future, do you think you can make a real run at wimbledon? are you excited about coming back here and hopefully going a little further?
you didn't hit any aces today. has that ever happened before?
what do you make of nicolas mahut? he had to go out and play doubles yesterday on court 18. it got suspended for bad light. is that just cruel?
did you think it was evil to put you first on?
have you given up the doubles now?
you have?
how is your shoulder?
was it the toe injury or the fatigue that forced your withdraw from the doubles?
john, what is on agenda next week for some r&r? what sort of things will you be doing or not doing?
but what is your idea of relaxation? what sort of things do you like to do?
you spent a lot of years in georgia. the tour is coming back to atlanta. atlanta has had problems over the year with pro tennis. what are your thoughts about atlanta getting the tournament this year?
can you give us an idea or flavor of the kind of commercial interest that you've been having over the last couple of days? any kind of deals that stick out? is there anything commercially that you fancy doing with what's happened over the last couple of days?
which foot?
big toe?
what is your shoe size?
you can fly from london to l.a. in 11 hours. can you promise passengers that never again will they be able to get on a flight in los angeles and catch the back end of your game when they land in london?
do you know how much weight you lost during your first-round match?
could you tell us when you actually got out onto the court the various things that were troubling you physically? at what point was it that you thought, this is over, this isn't going to happen?
physically, what were the things that were really troubling you out there? i know the toe, but what else?
do you think you'll have an everlasting bond with mahut from now on?
he'll be one of the special guys on the tour whenever you see him?
years from now when you talk about the 2010 wimbledon, what's the word, the phrase that will come to mind?
is it true that you drink a lot of coconut water? do you feel that was one of your secret weapons the last couple days?
can you sum it up, please, lleyton.
what's the best part about your game at the moment?
second week, this is where you always wanted to be?
how do you feel about the shape you're in, the form you're in now, compared to the last few years at this stage?
would this be the best look at this point at the weekend?
perhaps the best for four or five years?
were you especially pleased to stay in that tiebreak after you had a couple of fluffy forehands, to keep your focus and get through? i think that would have given him a big lift.
can you talk about the djokovic match, what you expect, what you'll need to do?
how do you rate him as a grass courter, specifically?
obviously our sport has three really distinct surfaces. between clay, hard, grass, which surface do you think demands the most of an athlete?
what did you make of isner-mahut? you're a guy who has been around for a long time. staying out there for 11 hours.
what did you make of it?
you're one of the most intense players in our game. after winning the tiebreak, you were doing the fist pumps multiple times. how do you think the fire in your belly is now compared to six, seven years ago when you were a good bit younger?
why is that?
you're known for your wheels, a lot of things. but is that your greatest strength as a player?
but where does your will to win come in?
did you feel today that your performance went a long way to justifying the club's decision to give you the boost in seeding?
apart from playing novak at the australian open after you played baghdatis in that dusk-to-dawn match, how has novak hurt you in the past when he's beaten you?
what plans for the weekend? going to get away from tennis at all?
looking to the match against djokovic, do you see monday's match, being in the form you're in, you beat roger two weeks ago, playing on your favorite surface, do you see this match as being one of your best chances in probably the last three or four years of beating a top-four player in a real billing grand slam match?
in another event, australia had a good result against serbia. is that going to give you a huge jolt of confidence in your matchup with novak?
did you give him a little bit of a hard time about that?
was it a relief to get an easy match after the first two rounds that were much more difficult?
i don't believe you played melzer before. probably one of the only guys in that age bracket that you haven't faced. what do you look for in a match where you haven't seen him face to face?
it's still the first week of wimbledon. you've had some tough matches, so has roddick, nadal, djokovic. do you think the depth in the game is the highest it's ever been in men's tennis?
was that your best performance, the performance you were happiest with so far today?
you've been to a lot of special events. anything at all surprising about your experience with the queen? what did you enjoy the most about it?
did she have any sensibility at all towards our sport in terms of references or knowledge?
what did she mention about your first round and about isner?
given the choice from a fan's perspective, would you take monday at wimbledon or saturday at the us open, the second saturday?
if you were a fan and you had a ticket and you had to choose between one of those two days.
it's a three-day weekend.
switzerland is playing right now.
i think so, yes.
as someone who has won many career-defining matches, what advice can you give to the england football team for sunday?
could you give us your impressions about the opening of the game, your play in the first set? i'm thinking especially about the returns.
obviously with the way the draw has worked out, could be andy murray in the next round. just your thoughts on that. obviously be strong crowd support for him.
every year you've been to wimbledon you've improved from the previous year. is this year going to be the quarterfinals?
how is your knee? are you still having problems, or are you fully recovered now?
which is a harder prospect: murray at wimbledon or nadal in madrid?
we see every year at roland garros french players don't do so well in their home tournament. it's been not as long as fred perry for here, but french players haven't won in paris for a while. do you admire the way andy murray handles the pressure at wimbledon? because he's our only player, where you've got lots of good players.
do you feel under pressure? obviously with the world cup, will you restore some pride to french sport here?
will you be supporting england now?
it was a tough match for you. what were you feeling in the third set when he was getting so many aces against you?
is the fact you came back from 2-1 down give you more confidence than what you would have gotten from a straight-sets victory?
going forward, does that give you a bigger boost than if it would have been a straightforward match?
you talked in paris about the strings you're using, giving you more spin. do you feel the same kind of effect here on the grass with the ball?
can you explain what happened this morning? did you miss meeting the queen? there's some suggestion you weren't there.
if you had known she wouldn't be there for your match, would you have gone to meet her?
when do you prepare for the match during the day? is it two hours before, three hours before, when you wake up?
you've been in situations here at wimbledon where your matches have been pushed back by rain or something where you've had to play day after day after day. for john isner, after a match like this, do you think he has a competitive disadvantage coming into the next round after playing three days in a row and long matches?
you said you wouldn't change your routine to meet the queen. is there anything or anybody in the world that would make you change your routine?
what kind of a night did you spend last night? could you sleep? nightmares? or what?
the match had its own internal logic or rhythm. sometimes it was a little crazy or surreal. did you feel almost a different kind of space out there? can you talk about your feelings as the match went on and on and on yesterday?
you were throwing up your hands as if to say, what can i do?
why do you think this match took so long?
was there any point you were thinking, god, i wish they played a fifth-set breaker here?
if i'm right, this match, from the second set when there was a service break, went 167 straight games without a service break. it's unbelievable, including all the other stats, two guys without a service break.
should they play a breaker here in the fifth set?
now that it's over, how does it feel to be part of tennis and sporting history?
for tennis players, two of their biggest concerns are fitness and mental strength. do you think you can be pretty confident in both departments after that match?
do you think the quality of the play will be remembered or do you think the match will be remembered just for its length? how do you think the quality was from start to finish?
have you played him in a match before?
had you done much research before this game?
have you had responses from other players?
how out of sorts were you by the end last night?
talk us through what your post-match routine was. what was the first thing you did? ice bath? eat?
what time did you actually go to bed?
do you think you can keep winning? do you think you can win another match in the tournament?
how far do you think you can go?
is there something that keeps you patient and mentally fastened on what's going on, some sort of magic word?
in the finish, was it the will to win or fear of failure that got you across the line?
he did look devastated. could you imagine what it would be like?
do you see yourself reviewing this match one day at home again?
can you take us through that last game, the shot you hit? do you remember the winning shot?
does it stick in your mind?
did you feel that serving ahead was much of an advantage in the match? was there ever a point yesterday when you felt like you might have to retire out of exhaustion?
do you have any enthusiasm at all for playing men's doubles now?
when do you expect to play?
what was the dialogue you had during the fifth set or with the umpire? was there any interesting dialogue you had about a time to come off or time to end it?
yes.
can you estimate roughly how many bananas you ate and how many bottles of water you got through over the three days? we like our statistics in the british press.
bars of what?
how many times did you change your shirt?
what did you say when you walked off for the bathroom break, and what did you say after the match?
was there any specific manny-isms that came to your mind from college at any point in that match?
what do you think this will mean to your future both on and off the court?
we saw your mom was on court today with tears at the end. have you spoken to her? what did she say?
she was crying her eyes out.
how do you feel about this match potentially defining your career? do you hope that some of the strength and character you've shown means you can go on and win a slam at some stage?
can you believe how far you've come since college to this point?
how did you feel when you woke up this morning physically? what did you do to prepare for this afternoon's match? did you weigh yourself today and whether you lost any weight?
is it still there?
you said this was like a dream. in some ways, is this even better than a dream? and what did andy get you for takeout?
after shedding so much weight in the last 24 hours, do you think you would make a good face of weight watchers in america?
did you lose track of the score at points or even stop caring what the score was, because what mattered was winning that one game to put you over the hump?
do you know how many aces you hit?
what are your plans to celebrate this win tonight? how are you going to spend the evening?
when did you become aware of the huge interest in the match, the fact it was on the big screen, prime time tv? what did you think of the fact that you were one of the two most famous tennis players in the world yesterday?
are you for the tiebreaker in the fifth set?
how many racquets did you get through?
you weren't able to get someone to get them restrung for you?
have you been watching isner?
and your match.
nba draft coming up.
do you want to talk about the match today. tough first set. you escaped an early game in the second set and seemed to kind of gain control of the match.
is the court faster? that seemed like a match 20 years ago.
john and mahut are in an incredible marathon. you had your marathon last year. what happens when you get deep into a fifth set and it just goes on and on? do you go to a different place? is it harder to focus?
when did you make of your return to centre court today? do you appreciate how popular you've become in this country over the years?
you've been here a couple of weeks, jonathan ross, anyone come up to you particularly nice, said anything particularly nice to you?
after you lost to roger a few years ago, you talked about the kitchen sink, the crowd really seemed to get in with you on those remarks.
sam has had some good success at the 250 level. can you talk about what a player needs to do to make the transition to have success at the bigger tournaments?
how worried were you in the first set after what happened with roger federer? did you think at all about going out?
is that your best serve-and-volley performance do you think?
another inspired and very accurate job of officiating in world cup soccer. any comments on what just occurred?
so it's safe to say...
llodra is working with mauresmo. what do you make of that?
how long did it take you to learn how to manage yourself in five-set matches where you're not just out there playing but you have an awareness of where you are in the match, what you have to do?
you spoke earlier about the appreciation others have of what you did here last year. how has last year's experience affected this year's for you, if at all?
you may have noticed that britain has had its worst ever wimbledon this year. does it strike you as odd or amazing that a country of such wealth in the sport cannot be able to produce players?
do you think perhaps there's a reason?
other than the federer match last year, is there any match in particular here you'd want back, a replay on?
what about sam being on the council?
was that a day when things went as well as they could have in terms of tactics and the way you executed?
seven unforced errors. you must be pretty happy with your efficiency, too.
when you see an opponent break down physically like that, do you get any pleasure out of that, any kind of satisfaction?
you've had a couple of long battles with monfils. what do you need to do to beat him?
does the fact that roger rasheed has been involved with you both give any significance to the next one?
did you sense any tension out in the crowd considering that england was playing at the same time?
are you going to watch australia tonight?
have a couple of beers?
all business?
are you pleased physically to be getting a reasonably easy run so far?
are you aware that the longest tennis match is going on right now?
having that in mind, do you think it does make some sense to have a fifth-set tiebreak like the us open?
were you surprised a guy ranked 152 in the world could play that well?
this isner/mahut match, does it give reason for a fifth-set tiebreaker?
is this a match that's reduced to a battle of wills rather than tennis ability?
can you relate that to yourself when you played in the final last year?
there's been talk about the grass slowing down. when you see those two guys, they've combined for 175 aces. not a lot of returns are getting back in play. maybe it shows that the court is at the right speed?
the final point when you were standing at the net waiting for hawk-eye, what did you exchange with him? everyone in serbia wants to know.
yes. they're proud of him.
is it strange to drop three sets in the opening two games for you? you wouldn't have been expected to.
do you think you have improved from your last match to this match?
what was the difference today than from monday?
how difficult was it to play someone with such a big serve? he got the record at wimbledon on speed of serve.
were you relieved to get that one finished tonight after such a long contest on monday?
when you saw you were last on centre court...
will you watch the football, as well?
were you upset by your five sets in the first round?
do you feel in better shape now in this tournament than in roland garros where you had maybe some wrist injury?
the history has been written while you play, because it's 46-46 in the fifth set. 8 hours and 15 minutes. what are your thoughts about that?
will you send a message to stankovic on this diamond day?
i take it you dragged yourself away from the television, or you cannot bear to watch what's going on on the soccer field.
would you rather be watching the french game now?
but was it difficult to come here now rather than...
okay. we'll talk tennis then.
does your performance today give you a lot of confidence?
it looked hard work for you out there. was it hard to get a read on his serve?
how confident are you coming into wimbledon? you've saved your best slam performances for australia so far.
is it a learning curve on grass for you?
do you think you have the all-round game to challenge the federers...
and are you now injury-free given what happened in...
what exactly what the problem?
and that's now no problem?
you didn't play any tournament prior to this one. why was that? why did you opt for not playing?
those were two pretty intense weeks in paris.
of course, you had the previous experience from last year. how did you deal with all the emotions and physical requirements you had throughout those two weeks and the following days?
we don't know your next opponent yet because granollers is going to play frederico gil from portugal next. you know granollers. do you know frederico gil?
your opponent today said you gave him a drumming. he said you just served him off the court.
he only had two breakpoints. you aced him both times.
any advice for him?
no englishmen here. just one swedish player. what can you say? what's going on in your country? can you give us an official opinion?
just doing a little aside of wimbledon. getting to know the players. can you tell me where you're staying while you're here at wimbledon?
do you prefer to stay in a house to hotels?
always having your family around?
so while you're in london, is there anything that you always make sure that you do while you're here?
is there anything you want to do while you're here this time round?
who cooks?
you rotate?
what was the best and worst thing about the wimbledon tournament? and you can't say the weather.
the best thing?
do you have any tennis nightmares?
any nicknames?
what?
okay. have you been following the world cup?
any predictions on who will win?
given a choice, a book, film, or nintendo, how would you fill your free time?
you said back in paris after you lost to robby that you hadn't been playing professionally for a while. i think you were a bit dejected and so on. how do feel now? have you turned it around?
was that your idea or some people you talked to?
so when you're feeling negative emotion inside you, what do you do? just try to swallow it?
you've never been much of a racquet tosser, though. have you ever thought about just letting the anger out rather than just...
do you do that in practice at all?
did it feel good?
you see lots of the teams these days use sports psychologist and stuff. you ever think about going that route?
so what laker games have you been to? i know you were saying on a conference call...
so when you watch, other than just enjoying it, do you watch them from a professional standpoint, saying, this is how kobe goes about his business, make i can take something from it?
probably ruin it for you now.
you watch the parade online or anything?
how much different is it being in england with the english mindset than other places in europe, like the french and just feeling comfortable?
did they come over with you before to england?
yeah, have they?
whatever happened to your personal assistant?
he moved up.
did you really? did it help, or you have no idea?
what's the difference between the grass here and the grass at queen's?
what's been your evolution in terms of getting used to grass?
have you ever hit with pete?
and he never gave you any advice on grass?
do you ever see yourself serving and volleying consistently on grass?
why?
but in doubles i would think you feel like you can get up there a bit, huh?
when you hit with pete, is it usually at his place?
when you play him at his house, did you kind of feel guilt if you beat him?
have you gone to any the basketball games with any of those guys?
he doesn't trust your game?
coming back from injury, how did it feel to be here today?
and how did that feel, appearing or centre court?
and how did it feel to test yourself against a player like nadal?
what did you feel the good points were from your performance?
have you ever heard someone speaking of the previous very good japanese player whose name was jiro sato? no, never heard about?
he was world no.3.
but in my time, in the '30s. you never heard about him?
what a pity, because it could be an example and could encourage a young player, no?
what's next for you now?
i read when you came to the u.s. you couldn't speak a single word of english; is that true?
how did you behave? how do ask what's for dinner or piece of soap?
and then an old friend of bollettieri, did he behave gently at least, or was very stiff? sometimes he's very stiff.
you played andy twice before, but not for three years. how have you changed? how are you playing at the moment? obviously he's changed.
the perception is with the queen coming thursday that it's gonna be a special day. i suppose you don't want to be cast in the role as the extra, because you have your own ambitions, don't you, for this tournament?
is it possible it could be a distraction, both a physical distraction, but also mentally coming into this? there will be a lot about the game, won't there?
you know that you will discuss this with andy just before you go out, because it's not a must. you two will decide if you want it curtsy to the queen. and the story is he is scottish.
if he asks you, you will be okay?
it's your wish to do it?
have you met royalty before in any shape or form, any queens or kings? the biggest person you've ever met?
do you have to bow to him?
her, sorry. (laughter.) she won't like me.
so you've met important women before?
what makes andy such a difficult opponent?
are you surprised he maybe hasn't won a grand slam already?
but not at this tournament, if you've got something to say about it?
so are you looking forward to playing him. obviously the crowd will be on his side and it'll be a good atmosphere. is that something you enjoy?
how did it feel to be back on centre court?
did it feel different after missing last year?
in your own mind, was this the start of the defense of your title, the title you couldn't defend last year?
was that as comfortable as you've felt on centre court? you looked straightaway into your groove.
how long does it take you to fully adjust from the clay to the grass? how far in the tournament do you think it takes you to get to your peak on grass?
what part of your game do you feel you have to adjust the most going from clay to grass?
did you feel special memories on the court, here i got the trophy, or, here i lie on my back?
what did you think of spain last night?
did you watch roger's game yesterday?
what did you think?
which one of his records do you think is his most impressive?
why?
john mcenroe was saying if you stay fit, he thinks you can get 12 or 13 grand slams, if not more.
you said the win today was the condition to play in front of the queen on thursday. you will be in front of her on thursday. is it a pressure or an extra motivation?
you spoke about what you felt was roger's most amazing record. of your tremendous accomplishments, what do you think your best achievement is?
in a certain way is that showing consistency, day in, day out being able to raise your game even under bad conditions? is that why you're proud of it?
yes.
what was the moment that came closest to losing to break that streak? did you have one moment where you were close to having that streak broken?
which was the most?
as a whole, how close is that to a perfect start to the tournament?
is that as good as you've felt since melbourne?
you've spoken about how you haven't felt as confident in the last couple of months. is that the kind of win that brings that kind of confidence back to you again?
twelve months ago you said that it was -- i think you used the term 'unacceptable' to describe the performances with so many british losses. it's even worse this year. what's your reaction to that?
do you feel it's getting worse? the results this year are worse. do you feel there's any progress?
how much of that pressure that's being obviously heaped on you as the lone carrier, how much of that are you actually feeling?
given that you already have that pressure heaped on you, looking ahead to thursday, the queen being here, how is that going to affect you?
you've learnt to deal with the pressure. do you feel there's things the other british players can do to learn that? obviously, a lot of them had chances, but they didn't take them.
did you feel more comfortable going to the net today?
thursday will probably change all this. hitherto, who is the most famous person you've been introduced to or met?
what has the club said to you about thursday?
what impact is the world cup going to have? you said there's less pressure or attention.
you posted some messages on twitter before the game. do you think that helps you relax and take your mind off things?
were you surprised to be on court 1 today rather than centre?
you played jarkko twice. you haven't played since '07. he's not going to turn up as a sacrificial lamb on thursday. what are you expecting from him?
i'm from finland. you toyed with nieminen, playing the lines and dropshots. are you capable of such a show here on the grass?
i can't say, but it was a few years ago.
how important is it to conserve energy? you had a few sort of knee niggles at the french.
how was the knee today?
going back to the queen, quite a lot made of a suggestion you might not bow to her on thursday. can you tell us about how you're feeling meeting her, if you will bow, and what you might say if you meet her?
you talked about coming back here kind of helping you, giving you a lift. you've gone one round further each time here. does that similarly inspire you, give you confidence?
any plans for tomorrow? will you be watching the world cup?
feel pretty good about that first round, getting that out of the way, picking up where you left off the last year?
how long have you known him?
he wanted to try to attack you, but you returned pretty well, too.
you get another attacking player in the next round. he's been playing well.
a little bit more nervous coming back into this tournament because you left queen's a little bit earlier than you planned to?
you had to wait over four hours to get on court 1 today. what did you do in that time?
which tennis match were you watching?
you were watching roger's match?
when you watch, does it get you tense at all? do you think, maybe i should stop watching this?
what was the buzz like watching that match, federer down two sets?
given how last year concluded for you, you said you were ready to play a match. how eager were you to get back here and get this underway again?
there are seven men in the draw who are fathers. with all the pressures and demands of tennis, do you look at these guys and wonder how they do it, be fathers, play tennis?
have you felt a different reception coming here after last year?
you've been around mardy the last month quite a bit. do you want to assess the state of his game, where you think he could be headed in the tournament. you might face him in the fourth round. do you think his level has been pretty good?
is it fair to say now that you're back here, it's a new day, a new tournament, that you kind of want to bury the memory from last year and not use it as some inspiration?
people are talking about it. they bring it up. you want to put it aside and focus on what you're doing. is that fair to say?
do you get the impression that rafa is maybe back to where he was two years ago where he can seriously challenge for the title again after what happened in paris?
was it an opportunity lost today?
you had, i think, three breakpoints in the last game of the fourth set.
do you think if you could have broken him in that last game of the fourth set that you could have won the match?
your explanation for the fifth set? because it was so tight in that fourth set and then the fifth set he seemed to get on top of you.
did you have an eye on the clock, as well, knowing it went to 11:00?
on today's performance, do you think he can win the title?
what did the response of the crowd mean to you tonight? they gave you such a reception whenever you finished up.
how much will that spur you on then in the tournaments you've got coming up?
just what is your reaction to your performance and the result today?
and what did you think of your opponent as a qualifier?
after the match, roger federer said he should have lost that match. do you agree with that?
why do you think in the end roger was able to win today?
until then, how do you think he was playing? were you winning because of things you were doing or in part because he wasn't up to par?
what were your thoughts when he came out to serve for the match?
we saw that you got treatment for your leg. can that have explained why federer got back into the game again?
have you learned anything playing federer all these times?
did you feel when you stepped out onto the court at the beginning that you could win the match, or was it only after winning maybe the first or second set that you thought you could actually beat federer?
you spoke about when you were serving for the match. can you describe the situation when you had the three breakpoints against him in a crucial situation and how he was able to get that game.
4-all.
yes.
how did you feel walking on the court with such a big noise, obviously more for roger than for you?
were you surprised how much the crowd got behind you after you won that first set?
did you have a different plan for this match compared to the last two times you played federer?
roger said he was lucky to win this match. do you agree with him?
what were your feelings when the draw came out and it was federer?
what does it feel like to play in centre court like that, with the brand-new court that hasn't been played on before?
we know colombia for the football and cycling. will this performance today have a good impact with people back home?
when you lost in 2004, won just three games, you said that was even one of the highlights of your career. is today in terms of the occasion the highlight of your career?
you played as well as or better than federer for four sets. what happened, do you feel, in the fifth set?
you mentioned there were doubts as you were serving for the match. how did that cramp your style? what were those doubts? what was going through your mind?
is there any point in the match you wish you could have gone back to and done something different?
do you feel like you got out of jail tonight?
as in you were lucky to escape with a win tonight?
whenever you went off for the break to bring the roof across, what did your team say to you to get you geared up for the remainder of the match?
confidence-wise coming into this championship, where do you feel you are with your game at the moment?
wimbledon completely oozes tradition, so how do you imagine a press conference near midnight playing at wimbledon? do you feel like you're more in new york or somewhere?
how would you sum up your experience playing under the roof and under the lights?
i understand you're a father; is that right?
i just want to ask about that and what it's like to be a father and play tennis and the routines and how you do it.
we'll see how long that lasts. there's no baby ambien?
so you can manage that, you think, be on the road and be with family? you think that'll enhance your tennis somehow?
so you did not go back home in between roland garros, right?
that's a long stint though, huh?
you kind of wishing you had the roger money now?
so you want to talk about today's match?
that's the type of match you go in and think, okay, he's a clay-court-born player. he's a veteran. this is the kind of match that even though he can play, that i should win if i play on my terms.
but winning four matches in a row including quallies is a good thing.
so on grass, shouldn't it be a little more straightforward with your game? you pretty much go out there and say, i should be able to hold, i should be able to attack, chip, charge, get in. this is grass. i don't have to do too many things different if i'm on the ball, right?
is the summer goal to not have to qualify for the us open?
you're not playing doubles, right? you rarely play doubles.
you have elements in your game where you would think that...
serve helps, though?
the bryan brothers can't give you pointers?
i think you mentioned a couple grand slams back - was it in australia? maybe it was france - where you were beginning to doubt your serve and volley game.
do you have that confidence now?
is that too much?
so you're not really dialing back on the amount of net rushing and attacking?
how is your body and your wrist after five sets?
i will ask you about the davis cup. will you play?
what do you think about the match against argentina?
nalbandian said that he will play.
if you want to tell me the percentage of chance to win in this match.
do you like to play argentina or...
anywhere.
yeah.
well played. even though you lost, you still managed to entertain the fans out there.
he seemed to have trouble reading you. do you actually make up your decision what shot you're gonna play very far in front of...
because some of shots are unorthodox.
where did you develop the forehand slice? you don't see that too often.
what was the experience like in the days leading up to it?
it's obviously been mentioned about potentially davis cup. you haven't played for any country yet, have you?
grandparent?
are you very disillusioned by the attitude of the jamaican tennis authority?
and they have never given you any funds?
obviously we go back to that cool runnings and the bobsled team and everything. are there a lot of sports in jamaica where is seems as though you're fighting against what's there instead of with?
if the jamaica federation fixed their attitude towards you and other players, would you play davis cup for them, or would you still look to...
so if you did get an approach from britain, you would change but with reluctance, i guess?
25 is a relatively late age to be making a breakthrough. why would you say it's taken this time?
did you play many other sports as a kid?
were you better at one or the other?
how old were you when you started playing and how did you get into tennis?
were you immediately quite good, or did it take a while?
can i ask you about your superstitious. you like the same ball back.
you also seem to, if you've played a bad shot with a ball, then you get it and put it in your pocket for the remainder of the game.
do you have any actual superstitions, like don't tread on the lines?
not during the points.
what about from here on? the rest of year, what are you looking to achieve?
where do go from here next?
so clay, grass, clay?
will you play that forehand slice on the clay court as well?
is there something about you that's typical german?
that's it?
is it true that the jamaican tennis president congratulates you for the wildcard in wimbledon?
what's his name?
you played so well. how disappointing was it to lose to andy today?
you've had a great week here, beat rafael nadal. terrific going into wimbledon.
was there a point where you thought, am i ever going to break this bloke's bloody serve?
the two trick shots sort of pissed him off. does it show your confidence trying to do that stuff?
a match like this, does it kind of show the touch you're in, the confidence you have at the moment?
would you try it at wimbledon?
people started queueing for this match at 2:00 in the morning. what do you think it says about the popularity of tennis, perhaps you as well?
you had to hang in there, work your way back into the game.
a week ago, how close were you to pulling out?
on court, you said it was one of the most fun weeks of your career. why was that?
singing got any better?
you wouldn't have planned to play such an intense game in this week. how do you think it's affected your preparation?
have you got anything, maybe still wanting to do things differently in your mind, anything to try to maybe help you switch off this week? are you going to be going go-karting again or maybe do something different?
back to previous years, have you noticed a significant increase in the spotlight? there's no world cup or european championships.
slightly different this coming week. you would have had it planned ahead, you've been managing an injury, you want to get through and get a trophy despite the injury. isn't it going to change exactly what you want to try to do in terms of work?
talk about the sensation of winning that trophy again.
winning twice, what does that mean?
you might not have heard about the other record. does that come into your mind now?
what sort of feeling have you got? is it satisfaction of having got this far or deflation of not going a bit further?
the draw is already out for next week and you have tipsarevic. how difficult is it to switch immediately into getting up and going again?
presumably that's what you want to be doing week in and week out?
how close were you to pulling it off today in that second set, do you think?
the crowd really got behind you this week. can you talk about your entire experience through the week?
after a week like this, do you not only feel physically tired by mentally tired, as well?
have you looked more long term than the grass? i mean, everyone says he's got to follow this up. where do you intend to follow it up after davis cup?
is there anything in your game that -- these last few days you served really, really well. are there any areas you feel you still really need to step up on?
you had the prime minister, david cameron, here watching you this week. have you had any messages or phone calls from any other...
you had a lot of friends and family here today?
and going to wimbledon, as well?
you've got another week before, but are you going into wimbledon with a little bit more expectation?
do you think your life generally will change a lot, or will you just carry on as you have been improving?
how good do you think you could be?
regarding wimbledon, did you watch the mahut/isner match last year? when they went past the six hours you had previously played, what did you think?
do you think you could have lasted 11 hours?
how would you rate your own performance out there this afternoon?
how threatened did you feel towards the end of that second set? was there any point where you thought that you might lose it?
how do you rate james ward? do you think he put in a good performance?
obviously you had the crowd against you today. you will probably have the crowd against you again tomorrow because you'll be facing another british player. how do you feel about that?
how excited are you to be in the final here kind of ahead of wimbledon?
can you tell us a little bit about your preparations for wimbledon? after tomorrow, how will you go about preparing?
for your training for wimbledon. will you stay in london?
we know that through your career you have had a lot of problems with injuries. how are you at the moment? are you fully fit? have you any problems?
can you explain the importance of wimbledon for a french player who comes over straight after the french open? what does it mean to you?
if a french player was to break through and win wimbledon, who would it be?
are you still without a coach?
how is that working out for you?
are you trying to find a coach then?
andy works with the adidas coaching staff.
have you worked with darren cahill yet? andy has benefited a lot.
is that the best he's played against you?
when someone is playing like that, do you just get a feeling halfway through that there's nothing you can really do?
what has he particularly improved the last two years, would you say, in his game?
is the court the same as it was two years ago? it just didn't seem the pace...
if or when andy murray wins a grand slam, where do you think it will be?
can you confirm what you said in the last game to the crowd? was it "keep it social"?
would you say that grass is as good as -- if you're playing him, grass is as tough a surface as any to play him on?
what did you get out of the week yourself?
lendl got to a point in his career where he didn't play the french because he wanted to really be up for wimbledon. can you see where he was coming from and could that ever be you?
andy said yesterday he thought grass was your best surface. do you agree with that, or do you prefer hard?
you have a lot of support out there, as you always do because you're a big favorite here. when you play him on a court there, when you play him at wimbledon, do you get the sense that he has yet caught the british imagination in the way that henman did? or is that...
i'm talking about the public, not us.
what about yourself? would you...
do you feel that there are quite i few things you still need to work on, or is it just a matter of touching up and fine-tuning?
at this stage in your career, what's the difference going into a tournament like wimbledon as one of the seeds outside of the top 4? does that affect your mentality at all?
you controlled the match really from start to finish. you must be thrilled with that.
did it feel like a day when you could do virtually nothing wrong?
that must give you an enormous kind of sense of where your game is with wimbledon on the horizon, the quality of your tennis today, the sublime way that you dealt with a very, very highly qualified grass court opponent?
you had a day off yesterday. was the ankle already fine, or...
you said on the court, i just got lucky. are you doing yourself a bit of a disservice there?
is he one of the players you enjoy playing against because he's always such a great matchup?
when you went on court you looked calm. you stayed calm the whole time. do you know before you go on court how you're going to feel? can you feel inside that everything was serene and lovely today?
when darren comes in presumably this week to work with you, is one of the things with a man who has taken people to grand slams be to manage your expectations, knowing the expectation of the country will be carried by you again over the next three weeks? is that something that he's important to you in that sense?
before wimbledon what sort of message do you think this kind of performance sends out?
it's looking more and more like tsonga the way things are going. you have a good record against him.
you have a week before wimbledon, but how much would it mean to actually win the tournament, win another title tomorrow? how much are you focused on that?
you seemed very relaxed this week. now, obviously a lot of that has been at home, sleeping in your own bed, being around, friends around. can you give us a clue what you've been doing to chill out, what you've been watching on the telly, what sport you've been watching?
have you been practicing your go-kart racing this week?
you haven't been with darren for that long a period, but how have you found working with him? where would you rate him among the world's best coaches?
which day does he get here?
has he worked on your serve at all? it was pretty special today.
can you comment on james ward sort of being in the spotlight?
is it a refreshing change for you to have the spotlight taken away for a few days? does that make life a little bit easier? obviously most of the time all eyes are on you, particularly when the grass court season starts here.
he's 4-2-up, so just in case the miracle happens, did you ever think in your lifetime there'd be a possibility of playing a final against a brit, and if it did happen in this tournament?
what have you done today? have you hit at all?
i guess you would have preferred to play?
when did you hear he pulled out, at what stage?
i thought they said it was his ankle.
with respect to what's happened today, you and rafa have had good runouts, but obviously novak and roger haven't been playing. is there a chance they could turn up at wimbledon slightly undercooked?
and roddick?
did you get a chance to see any of james ward's games or have you spoken to him?
were you quite impressed that he managed to finish that off?
last time you played roddick was in the semifinals at wimbledon. looking back at that, it was a very close match wasn't it? two tiebreaks to settle it at the end. in your career, how bad was that defeat?
you came in wondering if you were going to play this tournament. you would have signed for the semifinals?
roddick is a big step up, isn't he?
some people watching your matches against roddick in the past feel there is an extra edge between you and him on the court. is that something you feel, or is it just another opponent and another match for you?
what do you think about serena and venus coming back, and how well do you think they'll do? serena, especially.
tell us about the match, how it went for you. how was your footing on the grass?
you had a 30-stroke rally. when you get in the middle of one of those, are you looking for some way to terminate it quickly on grass, different from any other surface or not?
what do you think about him? he's come on a little bit in the last year, hasn't he?
with regard to wimbledon, are you kind of where you want to be on course for the tournament?
is the grass playing the same as other years?
some of the guys were saying it was slower than roland garros. is that a fair comment?
you're always known as a big sports fan. two-part question: if you were to be a spectator of any sport event in the past, which would you choose? and also, same thing for wimbledon: which wimbledon match would you choose?
you also spoke on court about you always enjoy your month in london. is there anything about the uk or british culture you don't get?
you probably didn't get a chance to see him at all, but what about fratangelo? are you pleased you've got an american junior winner at roland garros?
he hadn't set foot on red clay until milan two weeks before, so it was quite an impressive performance.
what are your thoughts on serena's decision to come back and take a wildcard at eastbourne this week?
how was that in terms of movement and fitness?
did you do anything different last night which has meant that you are now feeling so much better, or was it just the case it didn't react...
when you won this title two years ago, looking back, was that kind of a really good thing for your confidence, or in some ways did it sort of add to the pressure a bit for you when wimbledon came around?
yeah.
what's the hardest thing against him, a guy who goes for shots a lot? did you have to be cautious and pick your moments today?
very unusually there is another british player in the draw with you on this thursday.
i just wonder if that has any kind of helpful effect, and if it happened on a regular basis, would it have, you know, a long-term effect for you?
i assume you're not expecting to change any time soon in your career, are you?
you have a lot of boxing, but amongst team murray there is no cage fighting component. are you intrigued by the use of someone like that, or is that something you'd look at?
but james, in terms of fitness, other areas bringing into fitness, obviously you have guys with you all the time, but are you always maybe looking to bringing anything new in or not?
do you ever get bored with the physical work, or do you actually enjoy it?
just to vary it a bit, as well, to make it more interesting, different things, always looking for a bit of variety, as well?
football banned before grand slams, just in case you get injured?
you played in australia, didn't you?
which position do you play?
who are the other stars of the team?
you said some don't understand slide tackles and stuff. are you going to name names?
have you got a nose for a goal?
your potential opponent, can you talk about both of them?
is killer watching your matches here?
is that how it worked in the french? because he made no bones about the fact that his main commitment was to espn and he has a contract, et cetera, with them. were you talking to him between matches? was that how it worked out in the end?
just on the youth situation, oliver golding has gone to this academy in spain with blanco. do you think that's a good move for him to go out and with a spanish coach and see it from a different perspective perhaps?
how pleased were you with today?
is this the toughest transition in the whole year from roland garros to here?
in a perfect world, how long would you like there to be between roland garros and wimbledon? how many weeks?
a lot of people, andy included, think there should be a masters series on grass, one masters series event on grass. do you think that would be fair?
when do you put it?
you were obviously in control today, but can you tell us what you thought of matthew ebden's performance?
23
andy said that he felt the court here was very slow compared to what he was expecting. he said maybe paris was fast, but how did you find the courts for your adjustment?
can you tell us what you did in the 24 hours between winning in paris and arriving here? what did you do, for example, on sunday night?
no champagne?
no one? no one in your team had champagne?
because you don't play on grass very much, does it make it more special when you do well in tournaments on grass?
because you don't play on grass very often, is it more special for you to do well in grass tournaments and get to the final stages?
roger has received some criticism for pulling out of halle.
some criticism for pulling out. but the transition from clay to grass is so quick. do you sympathize with his decision? do you see why he decided to pull out?
the criticism comes from the tournament officers, not from the press.
the difficulty in terms of your movement and ankle?
was he more maybe difficult than you thought, dealing with the ankle and the grass and change and stuff like that?
can you talk us through when we last saw you in paris when you first tried it, how it felt, what any doctors or physios said to you?
how did the brace feel?
are you seeing the doctor now?
what did he say?
so if you didn't have a tournament this week, would you just be doing next to nothing, just keeping weight off it?
so you feel you shouldn't be playing really?
the longer you stay in this tournament, is it the more likely you'll start wimbledon with pain in your ankle still?
would you consider painkillers, if necessary, going into wimbledon?
in all the circumstances, the kind of workout you had to have today, is that in a sense more reassuring that you come through a match like that against a player like that who caused you a few problems?
do you know now actually did you sprain it, twist it, or did you injure the ligament?
yeah, because when you hear about injured tendons and ligaments, you think months rather than days, don't you?
are you looking forward to two weeks of ankle check?
your andy wasn't there. when he saw you, was that the best verdict to get? because he hadn't seen you at the french open. when he got to you fresh, did he say, oh, that's not right?
he didn't have his hands on you, though.
you probably feel medically qualified?
but you've got a huge amount of emotion and ambition invested. how do you balance the good advice with what you want to do?
is the speed of the surface maybe not too ideal for you, considering the rallies will be maybe lengthy?
in five, ten seconds after you did it, were you as frightened as you were that time in hamburg when you did your wrist?
did you think, oh, wimbledon...
what are your thoughts ahead to the third-round match?
is that the best it's ever been?
a little bit of a tight finish? were you pleased the way you held your nerve there?
how important was it to play in the tiebreak as well as you played it, confidence-wise, going into the second set?
he was losing his rag, as well?
where would you say you play better in terms of pure tennis?
is it fair to say that a lot of matches at this level you go in as the underdog, and does that give you incentive?
now it's important that you build on this win and also to get further ahead into the tournament?
you controlled that match throughout from the baseline. how much confidence does that give you against a player of his class?
with your ranking, you're a little bit isolated. you're obviously quite a long way behind andy but quite a long way ahead of others. do you often find your tournaments you're the only british player in the draw?
what in particular do you think you'd need to do to make that extra step?
who is your fitness trainer? who is your coach now?
how did that come about?
is he quite scary?
what's his country?
has he put you in a cage yet?
is there much in common, do you think, between cage fighting and tennis?
does he go on the road with you, or is it just when you're...
what do you think he might have done had you lost today?
has he worked with other tennis players before?
was he the guy with sort of close-cropped hair with the fila track suit?
how was your first match on the grass? how did you feel?
you're playing andy murray tomorrow. how do you see that?
he's coming with a bit of an ankle problem. when you know that in advance, is that something you look to test out early in the game?
how much will crowd be a factor?
what did you learn from the last match when you played this year? because you got a set off him. it was a quite close match, wasn't it?
you've had success at wimbledon. do you look forward to this time of the year, here and wimbledon, the next few weeks at wimbledon?
andy obviously had a long run at the french open. does it take a little bit of time to go from the clay straight to the grass court now?
congrats.
you've done really well on grass. is it your favorite surface?
did you learn a lot from playing somdev at the commonwealth games?
you're looking forward to rafa?
how excited are you? i mean, you are obviously excited. i mean, some people might think, oh, heck, it's roger or it's rafa or somebody. you could look at it the other way, like what a great opportunity?
have you ever met him before, exchanged any words with him in the locker room?
how important was it to get through, to come through the qualifying rounds as far as playing today's match against devvarman?
was that just food poisoning?
who are you here with?
when you say you played on grass in western australia, did you play a lot at kings park?
how did you feel about that?
how about that third game of the match after you'd just broken him?
are you feeling a bit better about yourself now that you're off the clay and on the grass?
you don't often go to a tournament as defending champion. how does it feel?
who do you think is the big threat this week, sam?
is that a nice feeling to come back here being the defending champion?
james, what are your thoughts on today?
do you feel that probably your best chance was last night, having leveled it?
was it that bad out there yesterday?
today aside, how happy are you with the way it's gone the last couple of weeks and looking forward to where you're going next?
presumably that's what you were looking to do was to follow up your good work last week?
have you got enough matches on grass in?
what do you feel you have learned most out of the last couple of weeks?
last week you were quite deep into it. did you speak to andy more than you would do normally?
do you pay attention to how he plays?
you said "at the moment," so you're ambitious to try and be as good as him?
you're thinking that's what you want to do. that's where you've got to start?
what's your goal, looking past wimbledon and maybe at the end of the season? have you got any targets? maybe top 100, top 50?
what has diego said to you?
looking forward to wimbledon, if you can actually hand-pick it, would you want winnable matches or --
-- if you had the chance to play rafa or roger on centre court?
has it been sort of a motivation? i mean, over the last six months, people have said it's looking brighter on the women's side. but on the men's side, it's just pretty much andy. do you read that, and does it make you want to push you even more?
he's always a difficult player to play against. seemed like you kind of ran out of steam a bit towards the end of the match.
i'm saying you kind of ran out of energy perhaps a bit at the end of the match after a tough week you had.
you must feel you have had enough grass court preparation for wimbledon, though?
when did you arrive down here yesterday?
are you getting enough grass court play?
what was the argument with the umpire? what was that about?
yeah. you had a conversation, long conversation with the umpire.
the tennis player's life is so much traveling from one tournament to another, but this is a very quick turnover to play a final one day and the first round the next.
that's pretty good for the a22, hour and a half.
what's the difference in courts between the two? is this the faster, slower than queen's, or what?
here?
on reflection, what are your memories especially of yesterday of the final, the high points?
the one that hit the net and just came...
i don't think anyone has dived as much on a grass court since boris becker. is that -- i mean, is that something new? i don't remember you diving like that on grass.
as a junior?
is it something you practice, or it just happens in a match?
if you reach the final here, you won't have much rest ahead of wimbledon, will you?
did you ever consider not playing here?
how are you feeling?
is it a case that regarding wimbledon, you didn't want to make it worse today?
is there any chance you might not make it to wimbledon, then, do you think?
you are having to kind of rebound from a lot of blows at the moment. how frustrating is it?
do you feel you just couldn't put much power through the foot today?
what sort of pain? stabbing pain or ache?
would you consider painkillers for playing wimbledon?
as injections or tablets?
how hard is it for you at the moment?
why do you say you feel better this year than last year?
did you have a feeling at any time you were going to get back into it?
the first two sets, on his serve you only made six points in the first set and again six points in the second set. how do you explain that?
you didn't seem to move as well as you had done in this tournament. were your energy levels down? was there an injury problem at all?
can you put your finger on why it just didn't click for you? wasn't the real andy murray out there, was it?
agassi lost three finals before he went on to win a career slam. do you still have belief you can win?
did you get the sense that the first set was always going to be the crucial one today, that that one getting away from you gave him that extra incentive to go for his shots?
can you describe how different it is physically and mentally playing in a grand slam final as to a regular tour final?
you said off the court you're very happy. is there a sense of frustration having been there three times and not getting one yet?
were there any improvements in novak's game that surprised you?
do you think you can still get close to his level when you're at your best? is there a gap there now that you need to bridge?
is it tougher for you to have lost in straight sets like the other two finals, or it doesn't change that much because what is important is to win?
rafa when he came in said he didn't want to talk about injury. he did eventually say he did have a problem. are you saying you were a hundred percent?
i know it is what it is, but this idea of playing, you've got 24 hours less...
what were you talking about to the umpire in the first set? you seemed to get into a discussion with the umpire.
you've played him a lot. has he ever been better at retrieving and playing defense?
you changed to plan b against david ferrer. did you have any tactical changes that you would have liked to have made tonight?
it took you a little over three months to recover last year, yet you seem to be saying you can handle it better now, not have the same effect.
is the other way to switch it around to say, first major tournament of the season, another final?
do you think you could play any better than this? is it a perfect match that you expected, that you dream of, or not?
is there a sense sometimes when you do feel a bit indestructible? whatever he can do, you have an answer for it?
when you got the match point, your celebration, you didn't do a lot. was that sort of out of respect for the friendship you've got with him?
you said he's the best returner.
in the first two sets he made only six points on your serve. how do you explain? you were serving very well or he wasn't returning that well?
it's been three years between getting one of those. do you feel like now that you're older and more experienced, it won't be as long the next time?
especially beating roger and andy, two good players?
how did you fix your serve?
you took a tough loss here last year, roland garros obviously, and then even wimbledon. did something happen in between wimbledon and the hard courts where you regained confidence?
can you talk about some of those secrets that you discovered about yourself that helped you get back on track?
but professionally for a time you were using two separate coaches.
from outsiders looking in, you seemed to be confused. you were getting two different messages.
you said you were sure andy would win one one day. what makes you sure?
three sets to federer and three sets to murray. how different were you feeling against federer and murray? when you were more worried?
you know him very well obviously. you talked about the way he plays the game. when playing against him, what's your number one imperative to impose your style of play onto his?
you have so much in common. what's the difference between having two grand slams and not having one? what's the difference between you, do you feel?
do you feel for him it's a mental issue in the big matches? you looked very confident and strong out there tonight.
you got your game to this level against the best players. do you have the sense you need to make the most of it and win the big tournaments now?
there are a few people saying now that because rafa and roger went out before the final, the tide is turning, a changing of the guards, so to speak. do you feel that's the case?
some of your footwork was outstanding. at the end when you took your shoes off to throw them into the crowd, you took out the insoles. do you have to have special insoles?
the davis cup win and now this, the last two months, has this been the best period in your life so far?
are you more focused than ever on your game?
how will you celebrate tonight? is it going to be a big night, do you think?
there are only two players but nadal and federer that have won two slams, you and hewitt. hewitt when he did it, he stopped. what do you expect from yourself, to win many?
which ones?
you've driven yourself to the point of exhaustion, overplaying, in previous seasons. how do you avoid doing that again this year?
are you going to play doubles with andy on the court?
how satisfied is it for you to get to the final?
can you talk us through the way you changed your game.
in the tiebreaks, you must have been really pleased with the way you stepped it up and won them both pretty comprehensively.
you said you changed string tension. did you go on court with two different racquets strung with different tension?
yesterday novak said that it's good for the game to have some people who can beat roger and rafa and not have those two all the time. now we have a final without either one. it's to your advantage to be in the final. do you agree it's good for the game itself to have that?
you played novak seven times on the tour. you maybe played with him as a junior or something. can you talk about the rivalry between you and novak.
can you take us back to when you first met? what were some of your earliest memories of meeting novak as a teenager?
was that first match in tarbes?
do you know who won?
do you think the fact that novak will have had 24 more hours to prepare will be a factor at all?
can you take us through the sequence where you said you lost track of the score tonight.
what did you think when you saw it was 5-all?
when you're in the rhythm of play in a tournament, very much in your routine, is it quite easy to sort of shut out the historic significance, how big a match it is? in some ways is it possible to treat it like any other match?
you didn't play against him in almost two years, but you won the last three matches in two sets. does it mean something or not much after all this time?
did you watch novak's match last night?
it's going to be hot on sunday. novak has had some problems in the past with heat exhaustion. do you think that might be an advantage for you?
when draws are made, i think probably we tend to assume that the toughest draw is likely the way it turns out. we figured it would be soderling to play nadal to play federer. do you get any more sense of gratification that you've came through people like dolgopolov and ferrer today, maybe even tougher matches for you mentally?
the other day you said you were very conservative about your money investment. how conservative do you consider yourself as a player?
djokovic yesterday said that this surface is the best for him because it's not too fast and it does give him some options when he has to choose the selection of his shots. what about you? do you like this surface a lot, too? would you like it a little faster?
you seemed a bit gimpy working the autograph line after the match. is everything all right health-wise?
how significant was last year? you tasted the bitterness of defeat, but you must have gained experience making the final.
you seemed to be going well early on. what happened in the first tiebreaker?
you mentioned the serve. what else does he do well?
you came back in a spectacular way. what do you think you missed in the fourth?
this run you've had here, has it proven to you that you can match it with these guys on the big stage time and time?
would you care to speculate on who in the final, djokovic or murray?
big disappointment. thoughts on the game? what went wrong?
physically how much did the match take out of you? did you feel at any point you were getting weary, that he was wearing you down?
you couldn't defend the title. what do you think about this?
how do you feel?
do you feel like there's anything tactically you could have done different or anything that you would have changed if you had to do it over again?
will you watch the remainder of the tournament or will you give it a break?
(question regarding who will win the final)
tonight you had chances to win the second set. you were up. then you played a dropshot on his breakpoint and you lost your serve. you were close to the net. do you think you lack some lucidity?
todd woodbridge after the match was sort of suggesting that with rafa injured and you out now that it was something of a passing of the torch.
having played this first grand slam, how are you feeling about the rest of the year?
do you think novak has improved in any particular way?
when you lost three years ago in three straight sets, 2008 here, do you see any similarity with that match and the one of tonight, apart from the scores?
just to find out if you played better tonight, the other time, or if he was playing different, if something changed or is exactly the same. just an idea.
two days ago, novak said you are maybe the most aggressive player on the circuit. do you think somehow he was more aggressive than you tonight?
was he putting a lot of pressure on your backhand side? do you think that was a winning tactic for him?
you had a couple exchanges with the chair umpire. was there anything about novak's tactics or crowd noise that was bothering you that prompted those exchanges?
nothing bothered you?
after doha's final, davydenko said if you play like that you would be unbeatable. how do you compare your form here and in doha?
i think you served particularly well when you were a little in trouble. normally, it was your problem sometimes, the second serve. today you played very well every time, especially the serve.
did you think you moved as well as you've moved in this tournament?
weather forecast, have you been happy with that? cooler this year compared to other years.
you had the very tough davis cup final. you were one-two down against france. did that give you a mental strength? you played well in hopman cup. are you just on a roll?
how did you see the semifinal tomorrow?
how did you see the semifinal going tomorrow?
walking in the park?
now you are in the second grand slam final in a row after the us open. and then is the full cycle for finals with no roger federer in finals. you see it like it's an opening, some window, to break the rivalry from nadal and federer and other players are getting in?
do you think there's any sense of a changing of the guard, a new era?
could you say this has been your best match in a long time?
which one you consider the best three matches you've played?
was it a tactic of yours to really attack roger's backhand tonight?
what would you say is the significant difference between the novak of 2008 and 2011? is there one?
you're blessed with a very strong backup team as well. how important is that keeping your career on an even keel as well?
is your girlfriend happy that you spend more time with the coach?
if it is andy that you play an sunday, seems like you guys are rekindling the friendship you had as juniors. you played football. talk about that.
it's been no secret that ana has a crush on roger. she always says that roger is her favorite player to watch.
i think so.
yeah. why was she in your box and supporting you and not...
will it make you feel more comfortable, relaxed, that in the final there will be no rafa and no roger on the other side of the court?
you said you had nothing to lose today. now you have everything to lose in the final.
what can you tell us about the injury? what did david say to you at the end of the match?
how emotional is it for you tonight?
it's going to be difficult for us to write a piece without appreciating how well you could move. it seemed to us you couldn't move as well as you would like to have been moving tonight. is that a fair statement?
yes.
what was the problem, though?
what you achieved in the last year was nothing short of amazing. does this break your heart a little bit that it had to happen like this?
how do you think david will get on in the semifinals?
after what happened in doha, coming here a little bit late...
you were ill in doha and came to melbourne a little bit late.
the question is, with you being ill in doha, then what happened after the tomic match, did you feel that maybe this tournament wasn't meant to be, wasn't destiny to win?
what will be your next tournament?
we appreciate your fair play, and we understand what you're saying. i just would like to know if you didn't have in front of you a friend of yours, would you have kept till the last ball and point to stay on court or would you have left a little before?
the match against cilic showed you were recovering well. did you feel anything unusual the last couple days?
earlier today andy murray said there's a number of guys on tour who on any given day can beat each other: yourself, robin, roger...
he said any one of the top six or seven players on any day can beat each other. do you think after the year you had last year, our expectations of you are probably higher than yours, given the evenness of the top six or seven players?
can you tell us your feelings tonight compared to this time last year?
you said your preparation was good for this year. was the vacation long enough after london?
how did the fireworks display disrupt your rhythm?
given the good form you're in, how disappointing was it that rafa had a problem?
you're undefeated so far this year. what do you attribute that to? why the good form?
do you feel some sympathy for rafa because he was injured?
rafa said at the end you said something of a joke.
yes.
he said you something funny, actually.
what did you say to him over the net in the end?
what did you say?
the last time you played andy murray, which was in the barclays atp world finals, it was obviously a very one-sided match. do you think the circumstances will be very different this time?
sometimes it's very hard to play someone who is injured. talk about how you maintained your focus. did you change your plan at all?
when you came on court before he got injured, were you planning on changing your game at all?
how do you think your game matches up against andy murray, the way he plays?
do you think he's improved a lot over the last year?
would you say you're playing the best tennis of your career at the moment?
this will be your second grand slam semifinal. it will murray's fifth. is that experience important?
do you talk to andy murray much off the court?
you played 84 matches last year, which was the most on tour. do you ever get tired?
rafa obviously was trying to win his fourth grand slam in a row. is there part of you that feels very sad or disappointed for him?
what was the experience like out there in a quarterfinal of a grand slam tournament?
you play very flamboyant and entertaining tennis, which is terrific. is consistency something you have to work on?
did it give you a feeling of how much you have to make up on the top players?
you played rafa a few months ago. how would you see andy's chances against him?
who would you pick?
what was the difference between beating soderling and losing to andy? what did you find more difficult about playing murray?
are you amazed at what you've done?
have you heard from a lot of people like your parents?
i think your name used to be dolgopolov, jr.
when did you get rid of that part?
last summer?
what do you expect about the next tournament in buenos aires, especially with another surface?
it would be your first visit to buenos aires?
what part of your game do you think you've improved on during this tournament?
at one stage during the match you looked up to the coach's box, and your coach wasn't there.
is that disconcerting when you look up for a bit of inspiration from a coach and he's not there?
you showed a lot of good sportsmanship when you were beaten by great shots. is that how you always respond, in that way?
there was one shot, an overhead, and murray played it down the line. maybe one of the shots of the tournament.
is he smart as a tennis player?
you told us before the match that you like to drive, that you drive a subaru. with your winnings, does this mean a new car?
a few players have said the courts have been slower in the last two days because it's been colder. did you find it that way?
the third set you played some amazing tennis, then andy got a jump on you in the fourth set. did it take you by surprise or were you a bit let down after the third set?
what do you take away from this tournament?
a very impressive win today. what did you like about it?
did his performance disappoint you a little bit as a fellow swiss?
can you talk specifically about what you and paul have been working on the last six months.
the results have been very good since you started working with him.
just a question about you and rafa. can you remember your first impressions of him? how do you think your relationship has developed over the years? you have this friendship and strong respect, which is quite unusual for great rivals.
do you talk about tennis with him?
assuming that you agree that you've gotten more aggressive, what went into the thinking that you thought that was necessary in your game plan?
how special would it be for the game if you and rafa got through to sunday?
can you reflect back on the two losses to djokovic, both here three years ago and the us open. obviously you have a great record against him. those are arguably the two biggest wins of his life.
just a question about all your languages. do you ever wish or regret that you speak so many languages, you have to spend so much time? compared to tiger woods or beckham or those guys, you give a lot more to the media. why do you do that?
many players are saying that the atmosphere in the tour is relaxed and friendly. it was never like this. they say this is your merit and rafa's merit, not just because of players, but as a person. are you aware of this and proud of achieving this?
what do you do with all your free towels that you get?
you were talking the other day about the single-handed and double-handed. would you be surprised to know that you haven't lost to a single-handed backhand player for seven years in a grand slams?
do you know any idea as to why that might be?
what happened in the second set?
you had some trouble in the second set. the rest was a holiday.
are you happy to be at this stage of the competition and face your next opponent, which will be a tough one?
how do you explain your freshness? you say it's quite surprising and even you didn't stop after the celebration.
what kind of change, for example, in your timing?
how did you keep mentally fresh? i can understand the physical and the organization, but after a really long season and the high of davis cup and then coming to perth, how did you keep your mind fresh and the desire where you really want to play well?
talk about the period in between the us open, where you beat federer, and davis cup, where you take losses to federer. was your mind on davis cup the whole time? and can you erase what happened in between the us open and davis cup, the tournaments that you played then?
the davis cup final, right.
does it mean you'll enter the court even stronger compared to your semis against him in new york?
it appears that the difference between rafa and federer, you and murray, with the rest of the players is growing in the tournament. do you see it that way?
you said before going against federer you feel like you've got nothing to lose. do you feel like you're going into the match on equal terms or as the underdog?
so is confidence the only difference in past matches when you weren't succeeding against federer?
i guess one of the important things against roger is not to let him get on top of you quickly, to get into the match. once he gets in front he's pretty hard to stop.
how would you describe your relationship with him? it seemed in basel you were joking around with him after the finals.
yeah.
have you done any more impersonations lately?
was there an official celebration after the davis cup?
after the meeting with some political...
what do you do for your excellent footwork? what's the secret behind this?
you had your right foot taped at 4-1 in the fourth set. did that hinder you right throughout the game? what's the extent of the injury?
it didn't hinder you at all?
you won the first set. seemed to struggle in the rest of the sets. what was the story there?
what did you think of him as a player? what are some of his qualities?
did you underestimate him today?
what was the problem to your foot? i think in the second set i saw something. also on your serve, there were some first serves 136 kilometers per hour, which is not your usual speed.
you're not going to fire pistolesi as your new coach?
can you tell me what pistolesi has brought to your game, some new things?
like what?
can you put your finger on why the australian open has been a bit of a bogey tournament for you?
is it the weather or heat?
rafa talked the other day that he wasn't playing well but managed to pull it out. do you feel even though you weren't playing well, you should have pulled it out?
did you have a tough time with his slice?
where are you going next?
then?
if you were to point to the main strength or skill of dolgopolov, what would you point to? what is the main skill of this guy for you?
how much do victories over nadal and federer in previous years has built up a great player and you believe in yourself that you're gonna be a top player?
you're so different, at least you seem so different, to pistolesi. he is always telling jokes. i don't know if he does it with you. but i know him since he was 18 years old. do you like the company also or you don't see away from tennis?
well, start.
did you take something from that today?
what was different about playing him compared to llodra and youzhny, or was it something to do with you?
you were down two sets to one. did it enter your mind that you might have to play a fifth set? would have been the first time in your career.
did you feel it in the legs towards the end?
you didn't seem to be uncomfortable playing in a big stadium like that.
how do you rate this tournament? were you surprised a little by yourself?
what did you learn from this?
i don't know if you've been asked, did you have an idol growing up?
what are the little things you need to improve, do you think?
when you said you started feeling it in the legs, do you think it was the accumulation of all the pressure matches you played or a little bit of nerves or both? what is your schedule?
that's a lot of traveling.
how did you pick up tennis?
how old were you?
how are you feeling? do you think you're fully recovered?
do you have any idea as to why you didn't feel that good a couple of days ago? is it a medical situation or just you didn't feel great?
cilic just said he had some kind of trouble with the weather. how did you feel with the weather, with the cold? he said it was a bit cold for him. it suited you better than him.
i think he was saying that because it was cold and the ball wasn't bouncing as much.
yes.
he was saying it was less.
we'd like to know, apart from winning, what do you enjoy most about being on court? do you enjoy saving the breakpoints or hitting passing shots, hitting a winner?
you've spoken before about the strength of spanish sport generally. is it special for you to play against david in a quarterfinal here?
you've seen a lot of him over the years, played against him a lot. you know each other's game pretty well.
is playing david going to be a tougher test of your fitness and your health compared to the match today?
you played many times more than five hours per match. what was your reaction when you heard that yesterday schiavone and kuznetsova played 4 hours and 44 minutes in just three sets?
did you see any of that?
you were capable to come back after a long match with verdasco and play well in the final. many people were surprised. do you think francesca schiavone can be strong enough to play wozniacki, or you don't think it's possible?
do you find it distracting when everybody is calling out, i love you, rafa?
are you able to block it out?
what about when the girls whistle at you and take pictures of you when you're changing your shirt?
could you tell us more about this armani campaign? was it a good experience? what do you think of the pictures?
do you find you sexy on the picture?
yeah, i do.
you say it was long. how long were you one next to the other?
just a question about the hawk-eye system. is it difficult to know when to challenge and when not to challenge? how do you feel when you challenge and the result is that it's just in or just out or very close?
you must be rather contented with that performance today.
when you see someone who can be so difficult, throwing his racquet down, getting out of sorts, confidence-wise does that put you at a high level that you know you got this guy?
obviously you've had straight forward matches. how are you feeling with your game, yourself, physically?
will you comment a little bit on the next opponent.
i didn't hear all of the post-match, but have you meet billy connolly?
what was that interaction like?
do you have a favorite billy connolly joke?
can you sum up the match, how it went for you, playing against milos.
can you compare his serve to any other players you played?
were you surprised that he stayed in a lot of long rallies with you?
did you know, because of galo, the fact he's been in spain, have you watched him play there?
what did you tell him after the match?
there were not too many people looking at you when you were playing four years old in monte-carlo country club with medvedev and others. what is the memory from there to today?
why didn't you pick up your father as a coach if he was such a good coach to bring andrei no.4 in the world?
your current coach is an australian, jack reader. how did you get involved with him and what's he done for your game?
what are your thoughts on today's game? you've made it to the quarterfinals. what were your expectations and thoughts on today's game?
there was some medical treatment in the third set. did you notice that and try to make him run a bit more?
we don't know your next opponent yet. if it's andy murray, what sort of match would you expect with andy murray?
you're a cosmopolitan player: ukrainian with an australian coach and an italian manager, corrado tschabuschnig. why do you have an italian manager?
is he here?
when you were very young and when you were touring with your father, what are the players that you remember meeting?
anyone you liked in particular?
is this the best win of your career?
if it is andy murray that you play next, what do you like about his game? what is going to be tough for you?
did you expect a little bit more from the world no.4?
on the atp website, i saw one of your hobbies is computer programming.
what was the game?
what sort of game was it?
you will play in the coming weeks in buenos aires and acapulco if i am not wrong. why these tournaments, and what do you expect from both cities, both tournaments?
who else is in the same management company with you with tschabuschnig? because you are the strongest, but there are more.
what do you think about this new generation of players, tomic, nishikori, berankis?
some of us know your father, but we don't know your mother. where is she and what does she do?
where?
you seem very relaxed. do nerves come into play now?
you played andy murray in the davis cup a few years ago. what do you remember about that match?
more from you or more from him?
do you like playing counter-punchers like him?
do you see similarities between his and your game? the way you talk about his game, it sounds as though you're talking about your own.
what would you say is your best quality as a tennis player, and what as a human person?
what is the best quality of yours as a tennis player? outside of the tennis court, what is your best quality as a person?
in terms of strokes?
if you could beat the no.4 in the world, do you feel confident you can beat the no.5 in the next round?
you say you try to be honest. were you surprised when you got a letter from the tennis integrity unit or not?
tipsarevic the other day said that these letters come mostly to the russian players and eastern european countries and he thinks it's not fair. do you agree with that?
you've been out here since december 5. have you been in adelaide training?
then brisbane obviously, and sydney.
do you think that's helped you, that extra time to get used to surface?
when you're not playing tennis, what do you like to do?
which is what?
how was it psychologically going into the match knowing you had this 1-0 advantage over nadal, but also knowing he hasn't lost a match since the last australian open at a grand slam?
how would you compare rafa's level now with what he was doing last year?
were you tired after the match with john isner?
when you say 'the conditions,' you mean the weather or something different with the court?
i know you were not a member of the winning team in 2005 of the davis cup, but do you still feel the benefits of that victory for croatia?
what are your plans for 2011? what are your hopes? what do you hope to achieve?
was there much you could do out there with him playing like that?
did you see the stats? he got on top of you pretty well winners to winners. you only had a couple breakpoints there. talk about your overall feeling of the match. it was clear you were trying to fight to get back in, but it didn't seem like you could dominate many of the points.
talk about the match in general. he hit a lot more winners than you, and i know it's important for you to dictate some of those points if you're going to beat a guy like that.
he's got roger in the next round. do you see him as a threat in that match the way he's playing?
well, how did you see the match unfolding?
last changeover you were in the chair shaking your head. what are you thinking at that time?
what in his game has improved since you played him in the davis cup match?
there will be a lot said or written about the state of american tennis. what's your take on the situation?
i want to know. do you think american tennis can, come the next major, be contenders there?
french open, wimbledon, us open?
do you get tired of carrying the weight? you're usually the last guy standing every slam, and that's been five, maybe six years of that now.
what do you take out of this slam? will you go back and give it some deep reflection or just a couple things you want to tweak and change?
i guess to state the obvious, not having serena around is kind of a big loss for u.s. tennis.
what do you think is stan's biggest weapon or what roger has to look for?
you going to relax and watch the nfl playoffs tomorrow?
after a pretty good performance today, do you feel like your bridging the gap towards getting closer to beating him?
do you recall your first visit to australia and what impression it may have made on you?
i meant as a tennis player.
we're one week on the way now. you had a scare against gilles simon. now you're in the quarterfinals. are you satisfied with the way things are going now?
you took a coach, paul, and now you're having another type of game. you're trying to improve. do you see that here in australia?
is there a sense that rod laver is a little slower this year than before?
do you think it plays to anyone's advantage?
what do you prefer to do deep down as a player: attack or sit back and have long rallies and play baseline tennis?
do you think if you play offensively, which you have been here, and you said yourself you play your best tennis that way, that the unforced errors, you have to almost accept that that's going to happen?
when did you have a horrible backhand? or were you being a little bit modest?
do you think if you were starting off now you would have a double-handed backhand? that's all the coaches seem to coach these days.
who or what can could stop this being another federer/nadal final?
there may come a day when you are not the no.1, no.2 with rafa. do you see yourself having the same motivation, the same attitude, fighting in the tour as a no.5, 6, 7 in the world?
one more sweet victory today. one more small step towards the ultimate crown.
you looked relaxed today. what was the secret?
just on another topic, you seem to be aware of a lot of different sports. just wondering if you know that the rugby world cup is on this year.
what sort of support would you have? england, france?
which other sports you would play if you were not a tennis player?
was that a good match to have approaching the quarterfinals?
so it's looking good going into the final?
what happened with the umpire at the beginning of the second set? was it coaching?
has it ever happened to you before?
you aren't denying you did it. you're saying you should get one strike?
what are your views on coaching? in the women's tour the coach can now come down and have a little reassuring chat. what do you think should happen?
you've won the davis cup now.
so you've got a captain sitting next to you. do you listen to the captain very much or do you just want to be in your own head all the time?
tennis should be more fun?
looking at the second week, how did you see the tournament shaping up?
given your next opponent, is it more about power? do you change your practice tomorrow to accommodate that or do you know them well enough?
how open is this tournament? you've got a very strong field of players left. it's like a u.s. masters or something. how open is it?
of those guys, you seem to show the most confidence against roger when you play him in grand slams. you don't seem to have any fear of this. you've beaten him twice.
how important is it for you to have marian back in your box after us open?
i know you have a tournament in serbia. is there anything else you invest in?
was that a good match for you now approaching the finals?
quarterfinals.
did the scoreline surprise you? it was pretty straight-sets win. did you expect more from him?
nine unforced errors in nearly two hours. can you recall having a grand slam match of that standard?
if it worries you at all, but everyone before a championship talks about federer, nadal, murray, djokovic. i think people forget about you and how good you are. does that get under your skin a little bit?
does it bother you at all when lucie loses and it's a very close match? have you ever had a time in the past where that discourages you?
is it discouraging that she plays so well and hitting the winners and the other player is being defensive, just that little bit in the second set. she was hitting bigger shots than zvonareva. zvonareva was very defensive and it was too bad because maybe she had chances.
it's been suggested that the courts here are as slow as a lot of players can remember. do you think that suits you or not at all?
looking forward to playing on rod laver?
you played so many times on show court 3 or margaret court. do you feel really comfortable there?
can you let us know how you got the cheer squad? where did they come from?
do you know whether they're all from here or other parts of australia?
do you have anywhere else in the world where grown, bare-chested men hug each other and cheer you on?
have they asked you for tickets?
particularly on the big courts, is it going to be difficult to get them in?
how do you like the matchup with djokovic?
when things are not going too well, do you think back to wimbledon?
how do you explain the five-set loss?
what disappointed you about your game? any particular thing?
you kept hitting your hip. did that slow down your movement at the end of the match?
what was your emotion as the match started to get away from you? how did you try and get back on top?
so it became a fitness thing in the end? is that what it was? it went to five, and that's why those last two sets were so hard?
looking ahead to tonight's game, young bernard tomic has a tough job against rafael nadal. what would you do if you were bernard tomic going against the no.1?
you said you were out of rhythm out there today. how do you actually feel like you're hitting the ball at the moment?
how much did you know about your opponent going in, and what did you learn about him coming out of the match insofar as his game is concerned?
is there anything about his game maybe that changed since you faced him at wimbledon?
looked pretty encouraging. how did it look for you?
what did you learn about what you need to improve specifically?
do you think you've given other players a bit of a blueprint the way you managed to test him?
did he say anything to you after?
what tournaments have you got coming up? take it as it comes?
is top hundred a goal this year?
in hindsight, should you have played more last year?
before the match you were waiting in the corridor for rafa to come out. was that quite difficult to be waiting around?
there's been a lot of hype about you this week, particularly the last couple of days. what have you done to chill out, take your mind off it?
did you expect to be back here after the last match?
why are you playing so well? you went through qualifying and have gotten this far. why are you playing so well?
what expectations did you have coming into the tournament?
when you retire in tashkent, were you injured?
how long did you stop?
how difficult is it to play at this level when you never have before?
you were very calm out there. i'm told that hasn't always been the case on court. is this a conscious change?
is it hard to suppress your emotions?
what do you know about montenegro? have you been there?
in which way you are from montenegro and which way from canada?
i mean inside yourself.
what about your parents?
engineer?
the last best canadian player ended up playing for great britain. i take it you will play for canada.
you when you were in canada, you say tennis canada helps you. in which way? do they give you some money?
how big a weapon do you feel your serve is?
during today's match, when you get in a winning position, did you have to sometimes say to yourself, wow, i'm about to be in the fourth round of a slam, or do you believe you belong there?
in barcelona there are a lot of beautiful girls.
was galo blanco at the match?
youzhny said the freedom you played with is quite common with players in their first year on the tour. did you feel that? were you conscious than of it? it looked like fun.
were you aware you were pretty much a stranger to him?
what were you most pleased with today in your game?
how do you feel about being in the top 100 now probably?
how about playing on a bigger court than court 3 finally?
what's the reaction been back in thornhill with your parents and girlfriend?
do they follow you also in montenegro? are you superstitious?
you played with rafa in tokyo.
what impression did you have?
you mentioned before your uncle being the vice president. of what?
the country?
do you still have time to study something?
which top player would you like to beat?
there were some difficult moments out there tonight.
what advice do you have for him? he's a talented young player who is just starting his career.
cilic played a long game. did you watch it?
do you feel like you played well tonight?
how long did it take you to understand his game? he doesn't play a very regular game.
talking about your attitude, if you play one bad point or a few bad points, how do you forget about those bad points?
you weren't on court very long in the first two matches. was it good to get a bit extra time and a bit of extra hitting and still get the win?
you seemed to be sweating a lot early on, changed your shirt a few times. were you feeling okay out there?
was it a bit unusual having the crowd primarily against you?
you said you don't have a fever anymore, but the body is getting tired. are you concerned in the next week the body might not be ready for five sets after five sets?
do you think in the last year you have made more progress in your tennis game or in your english?
we saw your father here tonight. has he been to many grand slams to see you play.
fairly straightforward?
what did you think of his between-the-legs shot in the first game?
in terms of getting a match done with a minimum fuss and the quickest time possible, it couldn't have been any better today, could it?
how important is that, not expending yourself through five huge ones on a hot day?
just looking ahead to tonight, obviously in terms of a local match, rafa and bernard tomic is huge. how do you see that playing out? do you have any advice for bernard?
your next opponent could be jurgen melzer. you have experience with him. can you tell us what you expect if he is your next opponent?
you've been hitting up quite a lot with young george morgan. are you impressed with his attitude and his approach, what you've seen?
can you talk about the match, how you felt after the first set, then he hurt his hand, lost his level a little bit.
so you felt like your level after the first set was getting better anyways?
first time in the fourth round. you have to be happy about that. getting to the stage where you're going to play someone like murray, that has to feel good.
you're going to enter the top 10 for the first time. a pretty big accomplishment, given that you're 29, you've been out there for a long time.
you played him before. do you want to talk about that matchup.
so what exactly happened with, i think it was the line calls?
just in terms of the drama that happened on court.
the and player was leander?
right.
i thought it was the line call, to be honest, because we didn't follow much of it.
do you consider this the biggest success of your career so far?
what turned it around for you? you were twice a set down.
you will now play soderling. how will you take him down?
serves very well from the baseline. can you spot any weaknesses in his game?
what was the plan for this match since the last match at wimbledon?
we remember andrei medvedev talk about how he used to hit with you when you were five, pretending you were his son. what do you remember at that time when your dad was coaching him and you were on the tour?
how long did it go on for? how old were you when it started, and how old were you when you had to go to school?
when did you decide to be a professional tennis player?
how tough is it for you?
who was your favorite player 10 years ago?
now?
who do you like to watch the most?
you say you have a lot of stories from the time when you were a kid. have you got one or two you can share with us?
do you like to make some show on the court during the match?
you have hands very fast and you think very quick. did you do other sports or do you do some different things with your hands?
you dominate the game all the time, especially your forehand stroke is so good. how did you look back at that game, that match?
yes.
did you prepare any strategy coming into the match, or tactics?
the stomach problem, tell us about it. is it something you had coming into the match?
always hard to come to that decision. is it even harder and more disappointing against a friend and countryman?
tell us what you think about novak's chances here. nobody seems to be talking about him much.
so you got out of jail there, looks like. tiebreak was pretty important, huh?
just talk about the first two sets then. he was dictating in the first, hung in there in the second.
were you hoping he was going to come down to earth, or were you pretty sure he was going to at some point?
so if he wins that breaker...
so you're not going to try to do something radically different in the third set?
can i get your reaction on andre going into the hall of fame?
i mean what he meant for the game and...
quick preview on isner and cilic, what john has to do there? then talk about monfils or wawrinka for you.
do you have any preference between monfils and wawrinka?
a question about jim courier. i spoke with him this morning. he said that you were one of the players he most enjoys interviewing. what is it like to be interviewed by him? what do you think about him in this role?
is it strange being interviewed by the davis cup captain?
is it something you can see yourself doing in 10 or whatever years' time?
where do you think it all went wrong today mainly?
have you ever played against a forehand like that?
you began working with brad gilbert at the end of last year. what do you think specifically he's helped you with to improve?
a good game after a five-setter the other night. happy with it?
after a tough five-set match, david nalbandian said he felt weak and dizzy and quit 59 minutes into his next match. you had a tough five set match too. what's the difference?
is there something that gives you an edge in grand slams to bounce back in tough matches?
you had issues at wimbledon and the french last year with movement and back problems. are you moving as freely as you want to now and for the last few months?
just wondering after all the wins you've had and success, what gets you excited out there on court? is it saving breakpoints, hitting aces? hitting a great passing shot?
what is your opinion of bernard tomic and what he might be able to do against rafa tomorrow?
will you watch yourself?
two players have been investigated recently because of match fixing. i know you don't know...
yes. even this is off topic, what is your reaction? you're more pissed off when you hear about doping or about match fixing? i mean, they're both bad, but there is one of the two which is worse?
if a friend of yours would do it, what would you say to him?
for malisse it was the first time he played in rod laver. he said it felt like a different world. what do you remember when you played your first match here?
what do you invest all your prize money in, you sponsorship money in? properties? shares?
a swiss bank account.
are you never embarrassed for all that much money that you make? of course all players, all champions make it. sometimes you see also some poverty. you're helping with charities, your foundation. but still, you've got so much. sometimes you say, how that is possible?
just on tennis globally, i think there is 95 europeans in the main draw, and there are south americans as well. do you think there is ever a way for australia and america to get back to something like the glory days with all the european dominance? and what do you think the reason is for this european dominance?
were you aware that he was injured before the match?
did you need to have a complete game today or are you happy with the one set?
you're moving quietly through the tournament. is this suiting you? not many people talking about you.
can you tell how tough it is for a player to come from the junior level to this circuit like you did and some other players did?
the game is still the same but maybe it's more physical when you arrive to this level?
do you have to work more in physical conditioning or in technical conditioning? what do you think you can improve the most?
obviously you're focused on your next round. do you keep an eye in grand slam tournaments on what your traditional rivals are doing? for instance, federer a couple days ago struggled.
you talked in one of the earlier press conferences about how you're in this small group of players behind rafa and roger who are trying to challenge them. can you talk a little bit more about what makes their game so much different from other players', why it's different to face rafa or roger.
how do you become mentally stronger as a tennis player?
have you improved and are you closing the gap on them?
when simon beat troicki in sydney, did you think, good for us?
do you think it was a mistake?
i have a question about jim courier. what is it like to be interviewed by him? what is your opinion about him in his new role?
yes.
and when he makes the interview?
at the end you danced a bit of a jig. was that a matter of coming back from two sets down in your previous match?
was it important to win in three after a grueling match in the first round?
were you happy with today compared to the first round?
you must be happy with that. how did it feel out there?
what's going through your head now? what are you thinking about? dare to dream about the next step, which is a pretty big one?
you're on home court, the confidence must be getting you through? playing with a lot of confidence, how are you feeling?
what would you say has improved the most in your game in the past months or year?
can you talk about the way you're practicing, your workout? did you do something special?
you were very composed in the tiebreakers. what was your strategy going into each tiebreaker?
you seemed to handle the pressure really well. certainly today you did. what about the pressure coming now, you're the last australian male left in the australian open?
is it excitement or nervousness?
for those of us who don't know you so well, how did you develop your style? did you ever feel pressure to change it, hit the ball hard more of the time than you do?
did you feel that pressure to change your game growing up?
what are your expectations against rafa?
you obviously believe you can win?
what kind of weaknesses can you identify in his game?
the crowd may even be a factor now. do you feel the australian public has embraced you or are embracing you as a player?
you're going to be playing on saturday, probably saturday night, probably rod laver arena. what do you think about that?
is this something that dreams are made of?
what did feliciano lpez say to you at the net after the game?
any words of encouragement?
you mentioned not liking playing night matches. if it is at night, what are your plans for saturday?
nadal said in his press conference that to relax he might go to the aquarium. might have to do something like that before he plays you. what are your plans?
there will be a lot of hype about this terrific result, then you're going to play rafa. how are you going to be able to keep away from it all and keep focused?
what is it about the night matches that you don't like?
if you're still playing at 2 a.m., deep in a fifth set, do you think you have a shot on saturday night?
can you talk a little bit about your childhood. i read you were born in germany. do you speak german?
when did you move?
was the wild card thing extra motivation, to prove that you were worth it, deserved it?
what was it like being on the court with him?
been in a situation like that before, 15,000 people?
have you seen him play before?
but never on the same court?
were you looking forward to it?
tell us something about your background. did you go to college?
were you an all-american?
will you tell the key difference between rafael's game and the usual game?
yes.
it's possible a young australian with a similar record to yourself will play him the next round. how do you approach it mentally?
you talked about having to win three points to feel like you're 15-love. how exhausting or stressful is it mentally?
is there an aura that you get caught up in when you're playing an opponent like that? do you find it more intimidating?
under these circumstances in melbourne, who do you pick as the number one favorite for the tournament, him or roger?
have you ever been on the court with anybody like that, that power and spin?
where did you grow up?
where is your home now?
you've been playing tennis pretty much all your life?
how old are you?
are you making a living?
pretty good to qualify here.
you were really calm, cool, played a good match.
have you been told that that ball was on the line that you thought was on the line?
have you served better than that very often?
three wins in qualifying, then two in the main draw. is this the best form of your career?
has this exceeded your expectations, what's happened so far?
how are you going to keep up the momentum as the stakes rise?
having had those three qualifiers and these two matches, get a bit of rhythm, do you feel like you're learning more about yourself, what you can do against those good guys?
we don't know a lot about you in australia. you've been compared to mark philippoussis. do you know him at all?
no plans for a reality dating show?
what do you feel like this means for canadian tennis?
how are you feeling physically after five matches? it was quite warm today. your opponent looked like he was feeling it fairly early on. you're even a bigger guy than he is. how did you feel? how did the heat affect you?
when you compare this match to the last one and maybe the next one, are you more relaxed playing these matches than you were playing that last match in the qualifying?
and the 230, how many faster serves than that have you hit?
142, i think, roughly.
stupid question, but how hard do you think you could hit one?
if it is youzhny, any thoughts about possibly playing him?
what is the experience like of sitting in the same chair as federer and nadal in the interview room at the australian open?
how much did the first-round match against lleyton hewitt take out of you?
was it an injury or just tiredness?
what about emotionally? you and lleyton are great rivals, such a big match. did you lack motivation coming into this match?
did you feel like that right from the start?
what about your opponent, what do you make of him and his future?
how long do you think it's going to take you to be at the same fitness level as you were before?
were you aware of who your opponent was today? had you ever heard of him?
what do you take out of today's game, if anything? is there anything that you can take out of it for the rest of the tournament?
seems possible that you might have to play a young australian in the next round, bernard tomic. what do you know about him?
is there anything harder about playing someone who is a local identity, if not a favorite?
if you haven't have experience, it's not someone you played against a lot, what do you do to prepare yourself if you're a little unsure of the way he plays?
yes.
so you're pretty relaxed about it?
what did you think of roger's match last night?
do you think it's harder these days for a young player to make headway in the game, to improve quickly enough to be at a standard to play the number of players there are in the game today, a young player, with so much pressure on them?
you experienced what it was like to be a teenager on the way up playing against the very best. how do you think bernard will feel if he does play you? how do you think he should approach the match?
what he would need to do.
when you were a teenager playing against the best in the world on your way up, how did you approach the games? what was your attitude?
how do you deal with the high pressure because everybody expects you to win every game? how do you deal with this high pressure?
it looked easy, but how hard was it?
16 aces. got yourself some free points, didn't you?
you mentioned after the first match how comfortable you felt on hisense and enjoyed playing it. isn't there a bit more fun to be had out there with a tight-knit crowd?
you feed off that, as well?
your former coach, brad gilbert, is now working with kei nishikori. we japanese are excited about that. can you talk about gilbert, what you learned from him, what kind of coach he is.
do you take time out to watch rafa and roger, their matches, keep an eye on what they're doing?
did you watch last night all the way through?
do you think that tight run he had last night changes anything in the tournament at all?
you played your next opponent once at queen's. anything in particular that makes him stand out in your memory?
rough start?
did you think it was going to be as easy as that?
made a lot of errors, didn't he?
what about next round? is it cilic?
what is your take on the americans remaining: you, andy and venus, and venus is injured?
how is your wrist? anything to worry about there?
what are your thoughts about the match, how you're progressing with your game?
so how does this win rate with the other victories that you've had?
two sets to love down, what was your strategy?
when he took the medical timeout did that give you added confidence?
did you feel he was trying in the fifth set?
was he?
next up is kei nishikori. do you have any information? what impression do you have about him?
yes.
you've been working with gil reyes, and he always used to be very fit. is he trying to make you fitter?
seems like you twisted your ankle at the end...
you're no. 9 in the world, and obviously rafa is always there in spain. do you feel like you're in the shadow of nadal? is that a good or bad thing to have him always dominating spanish tennis?
how well had he played up until the tiebreak, the set points?
what changed?
as far as the first two rounds of a slam, how contented are you with how things have gone so far?
can you talk a little bit about confidence, how it is different when you step on the court and you are full of confidence? which shot does it affect most, strengths, weaknesses?
do you have a specific routine on a grand slam, knowing it can last two weeks, in order to stay fresh?
you've got a lot of nervous energy. hard for you to mellow that?
speaking of five-hour matches, did you catch any of lleyton and nalbandian last night?
your thoughts. an amazing first round.
is your excitement level at the start of another new year as high as it's ever been?
you still have areas you want to improve in the game. are you surprised at all that roger is 29, has won everything, and still seems pretty pumped up?
of your career, the number of european players on the tour has obviously risen quite dramatically. i think 95 of the guys in the draw here are european. from a player's perspective, does that change the nature of the tour or the game at all?
yes, generally.
socially, i guess.
does it have a different sort of feel than when you started because of that change at all?
do you think that's had an impact in america?
we're pretty excited about bernard tomic in australia. can you give us your assessment of his talent at the moment?
a lot of people are looking at you again now with hopes for the future. can you just sum up how your career has kind of gone. you were back here a year ago. how optimistic are you for the future?
a lot of people say that right now with federer and nadal at the top, it's one of the greatest eras ever for tennis. then they say, but who are the people who are going to take the game on in the coming generations? obviously, you're one of the people expected to. is that a pressure to you or do you look forward to that?
but i'm thinking guys a little bit younger than those guys.
could you tell us how much work you actually do with brad, what areas he's concentrated on.
could you tell us what sort of things, not being too specific, but what sort of things he wanted you to change?
i'm from china. we don't have a player on the tour. can you tell us about how the asian men's players get success on the tour? what are the important things?
your ranking, you've been as high as 7, went out to mid-80s, now 33. do you look at the number next to your name? is it something you notice?
when you see berdych who is now 6, do you think, that should be me?
is the journey now getting back to the top harder than getting there in the first place?
but for you as a player, you got to 7; is getting back there now harder?
you warned us two days ago it was going to be close and it was going to be tough. did you really expect it was going to be that tough?
was that as hard as the alejandro falla match at wimbledon in the first round?
yeah.
he's not the average second round opponent, is he? he's sort of a lot better quality. do you think that kind of match sets you up well for the rest of the tournament?
do you think your previous record against him affected you?
the fact that it's been a long time since you've fallen in the early rounds of a grand slam event, does that help you in a match like this?
you see simon returning to the top 10 based on tonight's performance?
you say the two defeats only don't mean that it's a boogeyman for you, your wild beast our whatever you call it. still, he's one of the three guys that causes you more problems, would you say, or maybe not?
did you change the way that you played in the third and fourth set, because early on you seemed to keep him off balance with short slices and dropshots and moving him all around the court. in the third and fourth set, he seemed to have a bit more time and then you put that away and brought it back again late in the match.
what was going through your head when he saved those three match points? i think they were all on second serves as well.
you certainly were made to work out tonight. he chased everything down. it was a hard night.
you did look a bit slack. can you put your finger on why that was?
i suppose it's a long tournament and you can't be at your best all the time.
and you got viktor troicki next. how do you feel about playing him?
on the tv there, are you paying much attention to this match as well? roger is being pushed to the limit by gilles simon.
wouldn't be a bad thing for you if roger was to fall by the wayside.
everyone seemed happy and loud and getting along out there tonight.
were you a little worried about getting a wild card?
good opponent today, a player with some success in the past. have you ever served better on the important points than that in a match?
the first serve that you sent out you were landing them on the big points quite well. have you been working on it, or is it just more height?
what is it about playing here? you've hardly had a tour-level win, and yet you've had three here. what is it about the australian open that brings out your best?
what have you been working on in your game, given you didn't play a whole lot the second half of last year?
slice worked well today; seemed to sort of get him off his rhythm a little.
you approached the net quite a bit early. is that probably didn't see much of that last year? is that also something you've been instructed to do?
are you aware of the excitement you're causing? australia hasn't been doing too well lately.
all the shots that you have, do you think that the physical side of your game just needs to be stepped up a little bit? is physically getting stronger going to be the most important? you're getting taller, but is the physical side the one thing you need to work on a little bit more?
last year there was controversy. you won your first round. played a late-night match in the second round. what are your preferences this time? do you want to play in the day or night?
seriously? do you want to be shielded, or would you rather the spotlight there?
some players prefer playing at night because it's a bit slower; others during the day because it's quicker.
are you sometimes surprised at the publicity you get considering you haven't won a whole lot of matches in your career yet?
this one maybe?
do you read the newspapers?
do you think the pace of the court might be to your benefit against someone like lpez? take the sting off his serve a little bit and give you a chance to get into the rallies.
do you have targets in terms of your development? you're saying you're still young and developing your body. do you have things you want to achieve by certain ages or times in 2011?
are you still growing? how tall are you right now?
you said you're getting wider. have you put on much weight?
there are no teenagers as of now in the top 100. you mentioned the physical aspect of the game. do you think that's the main reason, because the game is so physical?
a good start?
of the grand slams, the australian open hasn't been kind to you. you haven't got past the second round. do you think you can do better this year?
any particular reason why you haven't played well here?
is it much different this year under your new coach?
how do you approach a grand slam compared to another tournament knowing it could last for two weeks, have five-set matches?
you deal better with the days off in between?
with your improvement in the last two years, do you bring any different mindset to a tournament like this? do you come here not fearing anyone?
how much of a factor playing lleyton at home is in your mind when you go onto the court and potentially it could be his last appearance here at the australian open?
yes.
you played him here five years ago in a similar situation. did that memory play any part for you tonight as well?
do you have any more energy for the next round?
is it good to save energy for later or would you have preferred a tougher match?
were you generally happy with the way you were going anyway?
what about the serve? what do you need to do that's different?
so you say after the match you went straight to the practice courts?
you're winning a game like that 2-love and you can see your opponent is injured and hurting, does it enter your head to give an easy ball?
does a grand slam require a specific routine for you because it's two weeks and it could be a five-set match sometimes? do you have a special routine compared to other tournaments?
the fact that you have a day off between each match...
i guess you're not too happy about the result of real mallorca last night against madrid. can you talk a little about the start of the season for mallorca and how michael laudrup has influence on the team?
how close do you follow mallorca traveling around the world?
who did you want to win if they're playing real madrid?
how close do you think you are to your top form, and how many games do you think you'll need to play before you're at your best?
we're writing a lot about you going for four grand slam titles. do you ever read any of the stuff that's written about you or do you deliberately try to ignore it?
you're a great fan of football. do you also like formula one? did you watch fernando alonso when he was fighting for the championship in abu dhabi?
do you get much out of that?
does that affect your preparation for the next round in any way?
when he was going for it in the third set, he was firing everything. did you think, at some point he's going to blow up or can he keep this going?
is that court a little tricky? you had that great match against martin three or four years ago. because it's so far away, is it sometimes difficult to get your concentration right?
what do you think of the weather conditions so far?
reassuring to get that first one always, isn't it, in a slam?
first meeting with marchenko. can you give your thoughts on what he might pose in terms of problems?
(question regarding getting pictures developed.)
was it a million you helped to raise?
spoke to jamie about his accident?
(no microphone.)
talk us through your feelings after that.
how do you rate it as a result here? obviously very frustrating. you were in the match right through it.
especially when you're probably playing better than you have in a while, too.
how have you gone about bridging the gap to some of the better players and what are your plans in that regard?
even in the off-season.
still a bit of room for the rest of the year.
people seem to be asking if you'll be back.
you had so many close games against david. is there a particular reason that happens between the two of you?
are you feeling okay after the match?
how good does it feel to be back in a grand slam arena after so much frustration for you?
did you have to change your technique a little bit to put less pressure on your wrist?
have you become a very patient person? usually young people are impatient; they want to see everything very quickly.
can you describe this last year with your injury.
you talked about the support of the fellow top-10 players. how did they support you? did they call you or send messages?
was someone calling you or writing you more than others, better friends you have on the circuit?
i know you have to play more matches, but do you feel as strong now as you were when you won the us open?
what is the most difficult thing for you now that you've been away for such a long time?
do you realize there were only two players who won a slam out of the last 23 slams? one was you and the other was djokovic. is that something you almost don't believe today or something that gives you pride and hope that you'll be back?
how would you assess your game today?
the conditions of the court or the atmosphere, the whole thing?
you'd like a faster court?
how do you feel coming in? what are you going to have to do to meet your goals this time?
are you proud of mardy?
he was saying in press that he's hoping he doesn't have the same thing that you got last year, but it sounds like exactly the same thing.
do you find yourself more than ever looking at the results of other americans, almost sort of taking a bit of an elder statesman sort of role?
ryan harrison lost today. he said you've been speaking to him quite a bit.
can you actually teach someone or talk them into competing well at a slam? because both those guys are pretty disappointed today in their results. sam is at the point where he's a top-20 player. going to a tournament like this, he has expectations beyond losing a five-setter in the first round.
so when you and larry got together in the off-season, besides recovering physically, the illness, what were you talking about as to what you want to do this year?
what is your best memory of this tournament? you've had some difficult semifinal losses. el aynaoui or...
when you see your name in federer's corner again do you curse or do you say, i want another chance at the guy now?
tough match first up.
he had chances; you had your chances. there wasn't a lot in it.
are you overall happy with how you played?
you were ill last week. can you let us know what happened there and what the setback was?
and you're working with brad gilbert as your coach.
how is that going?
you came into the net quite a lot today. is that something you're changing in your game or has that always been a strength?
what are the new things you want to change in your game?
how will brad gilbert work with you? does he travel with you some of the time?
dante bottini, does he continue to be your full-time coach?
he travels with you all the time?
brad gilbert is here in melbourne or not?
what's the best piece of advice that brad has given you so far?
can you tell us about the first two sets and how you got back into the game.
what did roger say to you afterwards?
that ability to win from anywhere, is that something you've been working with him on?
i was in my hotel room, and i saw that de bakker was serving for the match, and you took it to a fifth set. honestly, did you think you were going out?
is that one of your best wins or maybe one of your most satisfying, given you were so far behind?
do you think you can go all the way this tournament?
were you surprised he tanked the fourth set?
the match for you must have been a nice way to get into the tournament, fairly comfortable?
a nice, short match like that, you must be feeling good afterwards.
how important was the crowd?
how does that rate? another record. six titles. no one has done that before. how do you think you actually played in the match?
the way you played the last few weeks, especially this week, do you feel like the best player in the world?
after a spectacular end of the season, regarding 2012, is a gold medal in singles your biggest dream for next year?
just tell us about the other members of the top four, what a brilliant season we have in prospect next year, and also a little bit more about how motivated you are to get back on the grand slam winning trail.
you talked about the fact that this time you managed to win a close match, maybe a few times this season it hasn't gone your way. what made the difference today? is it a mental thing?
two things about momentum. one, today after the second set, did you feel the momentum had swung over to jo? in terms of your finish this season with basel, paris, and now, how much do you think that matters to the beginning of the next season, or will the slate be completely wiped clean come january 1st?
you haven't lost since the us open. is still the biggest regret of your year the match point that you didn't make against djokovic? also, before, tsonga said you have won everything, your career is perfect, but you're missing the olympic games and the davis cup. is the davis cup a priority for you or is it not anymore?
i think the world tour finals equals a grand slam as a major title event. now you have 16 grand slam titles and six world tour final titles. how much satisfaction do you have holding both records?
talking about when you had that mental freshening up during your break, did you speak to anyone? did you go back and look at your old matches? what was the process you went through?
what exactly were the doubts at that time?
i know it rather bucks the argument that people are playing too much tennis at the moment. do you think to make the masters final extra special, it should return to being the bestoffive sets?
of this tournament.
the season is now over for you, but there is still a davis cup final ahead next week. what is your feeling for this final? do you think that spain is the overwhelming favorite? do you see any chance for argentina?
with so many titles and records in the bag, how do you assess your hunger and desire? has it dipped at all? is it stronger than ever?
give us your thoughts on today's match.
you've played some very good hard court tennis. now you have to go onto the clay. how easy is it going to be to adjust to a very different surface in a very different stadium?
was it difficult to come back so soon? you can't have gotten home till midnight or later last night.
a lot of players have complained about the length of the season this week again. can i have your point on that.
you didn't seem that tired this week.
you played better from the baseline in the first set. do you feel the match could have changed if you were able to take that first set?
just a question about davis cup. when you are on court, how different is it when you are playing davis cup compared to, for example, today's match?
with regards to davis cup, have your efforts this week and rafa's efforts this week left you at a big disadvantage against argentina?
give us your thoughts on today's match and reaching the finals again.
i'd like to know if you are more surprised by the records that you keep making, the stories you are making in tennis, or about the emotions that you keep having every time you win and someone reminds you what you have just done. are you more surprised about how emotional you are about these wins or not?
this is your victory number 12 in 12 matches against david. why is it so easy for you to play against ferrer?
could you sum up your thoughts going into tomorrow's final and really how much it would mean to you to lift that record sixth title. also talk a bit about both players for us.
we were having a discussion on the radio the other night about why, even though you haven't won a major for two years, whether you're a better player now than you were a couple years ago just because of the level of djokovic and nadal. what do you think?
you equaled the childhood favorite of yours today, stefan edberg, with 806 wins. can you tell us what it means to equal him in particular?
can you describe in a few words what this tournament means to you and what is it like the few seconds before you enter the stage? is it like goosebumps on your body or the same every year?
could you ever put yourself in the shoes of a player walking on court against another player with a 011 record? what kind of thought process do you think you'd walk on court with?
it took you five deuces to close out that 10th game in the first set. how do you keep your frustration under control or don't you feel frustration in moments like that?
you've had a great week. but was it a case of him just playing a bit better tonight?
you played federer last week and tsonga right now. how do you feel the final will turn out? do you think tsonga has a good chance against roger?
how have you found the whole tournament this week? you came out of a difficult group and reached the semifinal.
you said you weren't feeling good today. is that from playing last night or have you got an injury?
how did you find the whole atmosphere on court? you had tremendous support.
a great incentive for you for the new season?
at the beginning of the second set, a game of 10 minutes. even though you are both serbians, it was a big battle there on the court.
you obviously know him very well, especially from practice. did you get a sense today that he is playing on an empty tank?
can you talk about how much your friendship and relationship with novak has helped you as a tennis player.
you came into this tournament as the first alternate. you pushed berdych to three sets and now you've beaten djokovic. how do you feel about your performances and your year in general?
you said 'shoulder' and 'us open'. you're one of the few people who can compare this in terms of speed, power, motion, placement. how much has novak's serve changed from the us open when you played him there to here in london?
three times.
you talked about the year, it's been great, things are new. next year you'll be a marked man. have you started thinking about a different mindset for dealing with the fact that it will be different than rising into the top 10?
this is obviously your first time here. what makes this tournament so special and what's the one memory you'll take away?
where are you going on vacation?
can you tell us why that match turned around so dramatically?
you now have to play roger federer in the semifinals. how do you assess your chances against him?
do you have any physical problems? is there something wrong with your shoulder?
how do you prepare for a match tomorrow night?
several of the other players have been talking about how long the season is, how many matches they've played. you've played a lot of matches this year as well. are you starting to feel tired at this stage of the year?
are you now feeling that you're more mentally capable of fighting from these tough situations and getting back from adversity compared to a few years ago?
was there a point during the game that you thought you could go all the way? and also what are your thoughts about the davis cup final?
when you see the way that roger has been playing this week, can anyone stop him?
did you find it difficult being the second match, knowing it was all in your hands?
you're playing jo in the semifinals. how do you look upon that match? what will be the deciding factor? you beat him a couple of months ago in china.
the only match you lost, you had a match point. that means you feel in great shape? also, when you have to play a player like tsonga who is attacking you, does it bother you or not? you prefer normally to play players that you can easily take the initiative or it doesn't make any difference?
can you give us your thoughts on that match and how well jo played, how difficult it was against him tonight.
do you feel that you haven't been at your very best form since the us open? if so, why would that be?
why is that?
how confident are you that you can recover your form in time for the davis cup?
how eager are you still to be out there competing? it's not been a particularly easy year for you. is your level of confidence and eagerness to get out there and play still as strong as it's ever been?
are there similarities with 2009?
how is it different?
you were saying a little while ago about the passion had dropped a little bit. has that happened before to this extent like you've experienced this time? while you were going through that, how frustrating was it?
at the end of a very long, hard season, you did talk about the emotions of actually getting here. i know you haven't probably had the results you wanted. how do you feel you played and contributed overall to your first masters?
your opinion of the court, atmosphere?
what are the main things you're going to take out of this year?
aside from the satisfaction of qualifying for here and playing here this week, have there been little things in terms of the vip treatment the players have gotten, what in particular have you enjoyed this week?
you have spectacular rallies. did you have to feel a little bit like an exhibition today?
today is thanksgiving. obviously you had a great year. if you had to pick out one thing this year to be thankful for the most, what would it be?
you were just saying the nice things you've managed to get over here, being over here the first time. what will you souvenir from the locker room as a memory? being thanksgiving today, what are you going to do to celebrate that?
is it difficult at all to have the same intensity when you know you've already won the group?
that win takes you to 37 in the finals all time, two within lendl's record. how important is legacy at this stage of your career?
it strikes me that you're hitting more backhand winners this week. are you whipping it a bit more, putting more topspin on it? anything you're doing differently?
can you give us an update on the current state of affairs in the debate about the length of the season and whether a strike is still an option?
having said that, i don't know if you watched novak's match last night, there maybe is a perception that some of the other guys are short on gas in the tank. do you think there's anything in that?
are you now an arsenal fan? sitting next to thierry henry during a match, does he pass on tips as to what's happening at that level? what happened last night?
do you have any thoughts at all on the suggestion made by some people we should go to a twoyear ranking in tennis, like they do in golf, rather than a oneyear period?
yes.
i don't know if you would like to talk about the discussions about the new atp ceo.
you being the statesman of the game, considering your passion for the game, did you ever consider being an atp ceo in the future?
if you don't mind, could you look back to the basel finals against kei nishikori.
what impression do you have about him and what do you think about his potential in the future?
you're getting ever closer to the no.3 spot again. what would it mean to you to reclaim it?
if you get to the final...
that was some match. i suppose you'll maybe kick yourself for missing the volley. it was a remarkable performance given everything that's happened.
how are you now after that fall at the end?
you seem to have a tremendous level of support out there. i think you probably got yourself a few new fans as well after today.
in a way do you have nothing to lose coming in as a late substitute? is it an unusual feeling coming in after the tournament has started?
what do you think you're going to take away with you for next season after this experience in the masters and the good season you had in 2011?
after your practice on sunday with andy murray, were you on alert, if you like, thinking that perhaps he could be injured and that you might have to play?
he had a shortened practice, didn't he, on sunday?
are you saying you played one and a quarter with him?
mardy fish said the other day that if you fly first class once, you don't want to go back to economy.
my question is, how is the appearance in the london final different than other tournaments and how does it motivate you to stay in the first class in the next few years?
you've been practicing with novak this week. is that an advantage now that you'll come to play him?
when did you find out that you would actually be playing?
did the fact that you've been here and you've been practicing, did that affect your preparation at all? it could have worked out that you didn't play at all.
did you get a door with your picture on it?
the previous occupant didn't leave anything behind by chance?
you made the semifinals. can you describe what emotion you're feeling after making it to the semis here.
you haven't beaten djokovic on hard courts before. did you have a particular plan on how to play today's match?
you shrugged your shoulders at the end of the match when you won. were you disbelieving at how easy it was?
you've beaten the bookmaker's number two favorite and now djokovic. what is your goal now?
what made you play so well today? virtually everything you did was good. did you get a sense that it was good? did you get a good feeling?
this is not the first time you've beaten the world no.1. where does this victory rank in your career, in your achievements?
not many people talk about you as much as the bigger players. have you been playing your two matches like you want to prove a point to people and show people who you are?
is this result tonight indicative of the strains of the season? how were you feeling physically?
is there a sense of mounting frustration for yourself at this point when you wanted to come here and deliver so much and not get that feel you want?
you lost the first time this year 10 games consecutive, or out of 11. do you think it's a correct assessment to say that the love for your country, for the davis cup, when you decided to play versus argentina, is partially ruining an unbelievable year?
did you have in some way the sensation after the us open that it was kind of better to stop the season, to put an end to the season, to restart in january, but you couldn't because of the length of the season?
going back to the match, you talked about your unforced errors. did they come because you didn't feel the ball or did you feel a touch slow in every movement?
i remember shanghai 2007. it's a different year. you were very tired at the end of the season. ferrer beat you. but this is still round robin. you can still be in semis. now it's with tipsarevic. the serbs are there.
can you tell us the general consensus among the top eight players of the length of the season and what should be done about it, whether you're happy with what has been done.
can you analyze how your serve worked tonight and david's, if you were surprised by the level of his firstserve percentage?
what do you expect from a new atp ceo? would you prefer it to be a former player or...
you missed a match point the other day. you saved one today. do you enjoy the drama out there?
what were your emotions like when you had to face another tiebreak that was going to determine the outcome? a few more butterflies perhaps than normal?
was it quite difficult to prepare for that match? you thought you were going to be facing andy murray today. how did you actually go about that?
your second year in a row in the london finals. can you talk about how you draw experience from last year that makes you feel more comfortable, settled and play your best tennis this year?
you've struggled against tipsarevic in the past. obviously you beat him in paris. what is it about him that makes him so difficult? what are you doing differently at the moment?
do you think you are underestimated as a player?
do you think you get perhaps an unfair crack of the whip because so much is written about the top four that perhaps people don't appreciate the quality of the players who are between five and eight and nine?
how do you feel? i was sorry when you beat federer 61, 63, 6love in roland garros in 2008. i feel sorry tonight for you. i would like to know if there is some comparison, similar stories, or they have nothing to do one with the other? the score is too severe to be true in a way.
you were mentioning it's a round robin match. is one of the explanations that you didn't give a hundred percent because you know you can still make it to the semifinals or do you just feel tired at the end of a season?
is it then that you're tired?
as you just said, you now have a chance to play tsonga to make the semifinals. how do you rate your chances against tsonga, another aggressive player with a big serve?
roger has a good record against you on indoor surfaces.
what do you find is the difference when you play him indoors to other surfaces?
roger said maybe you also paying your lack of competition. do you regret maybe the break after shanghai?
how does it work in your team after a match like that?
but you go through it or just say, forget it?
you said you didn't have a chance to practice yesterday. were you still feeling unwell from the first day?
but yesterday you were still a bit...
i think we're all probably a little stunned by that. do you get stunned when you play quite as well as that?
did you exorcise some psychological demons against rafa tonight?
what do you feel the differences are when you play rafa indoors compared to other surfaces?
the score is unbelievable. you never beat him so easily. i'd like to know if you remember when you lost to him so badly in roland garros 2008. do you think these scores, when they are so severe, there is something strange? one of the two is playing at his best and the other at his worst or is that not the case?
this year you started to win tournaments when others started getting tired. how much is that down to being in better shape at the end of the year than the others?
the crowds here get very involved when you're playing rafa. how do you manage to blank out the noise or do you find it actually lifts you?
when did you last feel you played that well, especially against rafa? also, where would it rank in your alltime comprehensive victories?
this was your first meeting with rafa in a round robin. did that give you a little bit more freedom maybe in the way that you played?
you said one of your goals was to take time away from rafa. i don't know if you could elaborate on that. why is that important on a match?
after playing jo and then rafa on this surface, who do you favor in their matchup?
how did you feel on court overall?
tell us about your physical condition. obviously you had that break for the trainer to come on at the end of the first set.
how is your body? obviously struggling towards the end of the first set when you had the massage.
how much of a factor was that in your movement overall?
is it the sort of problem which could put your future in this tournament at risk?
what will the key consideration be? just not doing any important further damage to it?
so is this an injury you've been carrying or something you picked up during the match?
was that from paris?
in any case, if you can play, this is still round robin, you are obliged to beat djokovic and berdych. two years ago even the games were important.
this groin problem, you say it happened a few days after paris, was it something traumatic in paris or a gradual onset?
stretching for a ball, just suddenly felt it go kind of thing?
you did seem quite flat, your body language and everything out there today. is this because you weren't sure you were going to complete the match or because you felt this was going to be a handicap?
do you have any idea whether you think you're going to continue? you wake up in the morning and make a decision? when do you have to say whether you're going to continue?
how did you assess david ferrer's performance today?
what sort of percentage chance would you put on your playing?
from talking to your team, is it actually treatable this thing? can they do stuff to improve it or is it just going to have to be managed?
if it hadn't been on home soil, this tournament, would you have even started?
how disappointing would it be if this was the end of your season, to end it in this way?
can you give us your thoughts on today's win over andy murray.
it's your fourth game against andy this year and the first time you won. what was the difference between the other three?
did you sense he had an injury?
did you think he wasn't moving particularly well?
it's important to get off to a winning start. you have some key games coming up with novak and tomas berdych as well. good position to be in, isn't it?
how do you feel the atmosphere was today coming back here to the world tour finals?
that was a big fight out there. do you feel maybe it's your best match since winning the us open?
how does it feel to be back out there after going the distance after all of your injuries that you've had since new york?
is it the belief, you think, of winning all the matches you've won this season that makes you come through such a tight tussle like that?
how do you assess the playing conditions? you are a tennis superstar, now you're a worldwide superstar during the summer. did anything really change in your life? what changed when you became no.1?
yes.
if you could sum up what's been an incredible season for you and what it would mean for you to win this this week?
massive disappointment for andy today. he was unwell, not sure if he's going to continue in the tournament. you've been in that position recently. do you sympathize with him? also the home crowd as well for him.
when you get into a situation like you're facing a match point, as you did at the us open, and you did tonight, how do you approach that? do you feel that you just got to go for it and give it everything? do you try to take something off your returns? what are your views when you're a match point down?
how are you feeling after that match, particularly having a match point and being a break up in the third?
you hopefully get the chance to play andy on wednesday. what are your thoughts going into that match? how keen are you for him to be fit to play after his injury? you obviously beat him in paris. i'm sure you'd go in with confidence of beating him again.
do you feel like you missed your chances or do you feel it was his good play that won the match in the end?
were you nervous during the tiebreak? do you think that's one of the reasons you maybe tried too hard?
tomas, you took the world no.1 to his limit. you don't look too far ahead. if you could take that form into the grand slams next year, do you think you could possibly challenge at the australian open or at wimbledon?
speaking more generally about playing andy, you've beaten him the last three times you played him. do you think your game matches well against him? do you like playing against him?
you had such great support out there. did you know you had so many fans in london?
you can take a lot of positives from this performance. it's a round robin system, as you look ahead to the next two games.
can you give us your thoughts on tonight's win.
did he produce some of the best tennis he's played against you in the second and third sets with dropshots? has he played as well against you before?
you obviously have a fixed routine of stuff you eat out on court. can you explain to yourself how it sort of suddenly started, this stomach stuff, in the beginning of the third set, and how do you feel now?
do you think you'd eaten something?
did you take any medicine?
are you now worried about your next match?
you were watching roger federer earlier. how do you feel he played?
what are your thoughts on facing him next match?
do you have any comment on the remarks that yannick noah made a day or two ago?
before the tournament you said maybe it would be better if the finals was not in london because of tax.
do you think the tax laws should be changed?
so it's not a question of while the finals is in london you will not play queen's?
you played some great tennis in the second and third. you must be disappointed not to have won that match 32 and a break?
were you upset about him disappearing at 2love?
you had a bit of a slow start. was that nerves out there?
you have to play tsonga and then roger federer. where do you think this puts you?
how was the injury today? do you think it's going to hold up for the rest of the tournament?
did you think with him struggling a bit physically that might be an opportunity for you in the tiebreak at the end?
how did you find the whole experience out there today?
what are your memories of the last match against jo at the us open? it was special with the wind.
how did you turn it around? you lost control of the match at the end of the second set. how did you get back into it?
obviously it's difficult against tsonga when he's playing the way he did. how did you keep your cool during the tough third set?
what's the key to return tsonga's serve and how would you rate your returning game in general in 2011?
yes.
how do you see the court conditions here versus last year and bercy? right after bercy, did you take one day off or did you go directly to practice the next day?
we don't see pierre paganini at many of your events. are you working a little bit more on the physical side perhaps at the moment, different drills, anything new?
like you said, one of the reasons you play fantastic now is you take the asian swing off and it let your body rest. your fans in china are worried that it will become even harder to get you playing shanghai because you found a successful formula.
can you talk a little bit about the completely different mindset, especially at the beginning of this event. it's so different from the rest, that you can lose, not be out of the tournament, which is very different.
how do you rate the o2 here as a venue? perhaps your favorite in the whole year?
what did thierry henry think of your performance?
when you finally got through that long game with the set points, you seemed like a new man when the third set started. did you feel an inner surge, couldn't miss? everything was going great?
you have had a tremendous run obviously, but beating roger and then rafa in consecutive days, in the style in which you've done it, what do you think that says about your game and where you are at the moment?
do you feel unbeatable at the moment?
when you were up in the third set, at some point were you thinking you're going to shut him out 6-love in that third set? because you were going very well.
seems like the omens have come back. 2008 you the australian open and here, and you've done it again. how does it feel this time to win this title?
what was behind you saying to him in the trophy ceremony that you thought he was the best player ever?
so you think he's better all-time than roger?
the last couple times you played a us open you were playing well in spurts, maybe not so much in london, but weren't able to get through. what was largely the difference today tactically, planning-wise?
talking about the long season, after miami obviously going to the clay. do you think you have what it takes to challenge nadal on that surface?
you mentioned about the difference between 2008 and now this year. but you've won a grand slam. there are a lot of players out there who never have and maybe some that never will. what does it actually do to your spirit, your confidence when you do finally? i know you had one three years ago, but to back it up again, what does that do for you spirit- and confidence-wise?
after you lost to melzer at roland garros, which obviously is not one of the high points of your career, can you just go back to there, get through the nine months and can you actually believe you're at this point now?
melzer at roland garros.
yes.
you have had lots of brushes in your tennis career. looking ahead a little bit, can you tell us what the rush is going to be like playing tennis on an airplane?
there are so many aspects of you as a tennis player today that are better than ever. physically, tennis-wise, mentally. if there's one aspect that you can say, this is actually the key - and of course everything is linked - but that raise everything else. is it the head?
you mentioned about euphoria and perhaps not getting carried away. you've won the tournament. you know there is another one down the line and 10 more and 20 more.
accept one, enjoy it, and make sure you're ready for the next one is kind of a crucial element, isn't it?
there were a lot of young girls i guess cheering for you and singing.
serbian kids?
we think you and caroline are the first two apartment neighbors to ever win titles on the same day. wozniacki. couple comments on her?
what are you giving her?
what happened at 4-1 in the first set did? you consciously make any adjustments, or it just kind of fell in?
did you have a few problems your serve?
yeah.
before today, he had beaten the last three times you played. can you talk about where his level of play is now compared to 2009 the last time you played him?
yes.
how much do you think you've improved since the 2009 us open, maybe the serve, the volley?
how is your health right now?
but even outside of that match, your game overall from 2009 to now, you don't think there is any improvement?
as far as your health level in this tournament, how do you feel coming off the australian open where you had some problems?
you said earlier about normal being when you don't play your best. is that the mark of the truly great player, that you can adjust, sort of adjust on the fly to what your game is that particular day or what the opponent is throwing at you? your physical position?
when your level drops, when you're feeling your level drop, what do you do? do you try to focus on a particular shot?
i mean, we know you played roger and novak a hundred times. but when you go out to play them, either one of them, what sort of a sense do you have? and also, how will the conditions over here affect if you're playing roger or playing novak?
before roger walked on the court today, he said he felt motivated watching you win for an opportunity to play you. do you have that same kind of feeling? if roger wins, that kind of excitement?
can you just sum up this kind of average day? not a great day, but how did it play out for you?
have you had a chance to think about what may have happened at 3-2, 40-15, third set?
no, in the singles.
3-2, 40-15.
2-all, yeah.
how has his play evolved?
he says that before when he played you he was just kind of hoping that he could beat you. now he actually believes inside that if he plays a little bit more of an aggressive game he can stay with you. do you notice that?
since paul annacone joined your team you've played tough tournaments, made the semifinals each time or better. you tend to take the long view. so what is there still to do that's gonna convert semifinals or better into matches like this where you'll be able to get past someone at the top of the game like djokovic?
is it doubly frustrating to lose to the same person three times so far this year, or is it a loss is a loss and it's frustrating anyway?
you said in the doubles they played an unconventional game. can you explain it a little bit? what made them difficult to beat? because they only played just one week together.
can i switch topics a bit? the wayne odesnik situation, the guy who was suspended for a year.
but he's been playing a couple months futures, and i'm sure you're aware of that.
he talked to the itf and got the suspension reduced by one year. what do you think the reception is going to be for the guy when he comes back on the tour?
how difficult was it to go through a tough loss today and then turn around in just a couple hours and try to bring your focus back to the doubles? was it hard?
how important was that situation in the third set when obviously you have gone ahead and he'd come back to you at you? that next game, the fifth game in the third set, do you think that was a real turning point for you?
can you talk about momentum, though? because once you that he got the break that was a run of 11 straight points. can you talk about momentum in the match and how important that is?
when you've got a match as close as that, while you're playing it can you enjoy it, or is it just too much tension and focus and all that?
could you talk a little bit about roger? i mean, greatest player of all time, all the slams, no.1 forever. but it's been a while since he's been no.1, slams, had a great london, still a fabulous player. but can you talk about the level of his game? are there any slight differences now?
you said the other day tennis is so mental, so does it come down to a mental science?
what enabled you to gain that self-confidence when you play against him?
i'm sure that being no.2 is not your ultimate goal, but the fact is you will be after this tournament. how does that make you feel?
with how good rafa has been on clay, how important do you think tomorrow's match is in order for you to maybe catch him and be no.1 this year?
how do you explain this streak? i mean, you won 19 matches in a row now, and you're going for your fourth tournament in a row. i mean, how do you explain? is it just things fall together? i mean, is there something you have been doing differently? is confidence level a factor? how do you explain it? or do you?
this is the third time that you've beaten federer in two months. were you aware of him changing his game plan, changing his approach to playing you today because it's another hard court match? or did you feel that he was trying the same kind of patterns, maybe tightening them up a bit, but still playing in the same kind of style as before?
how do you prepare mentally to face nadal tomorrow after such a big win against federer today? or hows does the game plan change?
can you just go back to the us open final? because sometimes it seems like against rafa, even playing as well as you played in that, he came through with the victory. how much of tomorrow is going to be mental against him ?
how has nadal's game evolved on hard courts over the past couple of years?
you mentioned when you used to play roger it was going out there and hoping you played well.
when you've had two and now three wins against him, how good does this one make you feel? because the thought was perhaps because you had won those last two matches you were slightly favored today. so to come through in all those circumstances in a big semifinal like this, how good does that make you feel in terms of where you are with your game at the moment?
could you talk about the yellow bird, the origami?
can you tell the story behind that?
how do you maintain an intense rivalry with a guy you're gonna get on a plane with tomorrow night and go to south america with?
you've obviously had a great start to the year, but to come into this event and to take out roger - and if you're successful tomorrow, rafa - how would that change your kind of confidence level?
just getting back to roger and what neil was asking you, when you look at the difference between the matches you've played with roger a few years ago and now, how much of it do you think is that maybe you've improved more than maybe roger has in that time frame?
you made good starts in both sets but couldn't really capitalize.
it's not about today's match, but you came to japan almost every year. i think you have some idea about what's happening in japan now. could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on japan?
can you assess this tournament for you? you know, there are a couple of top 10 players you disposed of, and...
what's different playing djokovic than playing roger or rafa? what makes him different?
do you see a difference in novak this season?
a pretty good day at the office for you today.
surprised your singles went as easily as it did?
you've had so many interactions with rafa and obviously the great matches, the xos all the time with your fund-raising, probably in the locker room and probably tonight on court. talk about rafa off court as your friend, as a person. what do you like about him as a person?
it will be the third time you've faced djokovic in the last two months. are you thinking that given the two results that you need to have some adjustments to your game, or do you think the last two results were based on a few points here and there?
you won the toss and you elected the right side of the court. that's quite unusual. can you talk us through the rationale behind it?
the other day you talked about the charity and the foundation you're working on in south africa. speaking of charities, do you have any thoughts on the japanese, what's happening in japan?
have you ever played doubles in front of that many people?
was it fun out there?
with the singles and doubles, you'll potentially play quite a few matches in friday, saturday, sunday. how do you feel about your ability and recovery tonight and your ability to...
i know you haven't had a chance to think too much about the match tomorrow, but any initial thoughts about what you will be trying to do tomorrow to win that match?
you have a battle where novak can pass you for no.2. does that stuff ever enter your mind?
is there a different mindset for you when you're coming out against someone like novak compared to a lot of the other players?
you have had such a great career, and the other night you mentioned you had good fortune in terms of your health. you could always change things; things could always be better. if you could change one or two things in your career over the years, what would that have been?
oh, just approaches, activity of play, coaches, stroke-wise.
it just doesn't seem like in any match these days that you really get yourself into big trouble.
is there any shot now that you don't feel comfortable with? it seems like you can go to, you know, forehand spin, flat, backhand drive, dropshot, lob, whatever you want now.
when he jumps out to a 2-love lead to start the match, is there any sense that you're just not feeling it today, you're a little bit off, or do you have enough confidence you can just shake it off?
a lot has been made about the improvement or consistency of your serve the last year, but maybe over the last couple years, and especially against better players like roger, your forehand seems to be a lot more powerful. am i wrong about that, or do you feel like now you can hit the forehand much bigger for winners?
you obviously are focused on a run here for hopefully another title. could you take a minute and talk about incredible moment after a huge win, say, the davis cup championship? what goes through your mind, your body, just at that moment when you know that you have it.
in those moments, do you kind of go numb? do you do any kind of flashback to when you're a kid and just in the moments after that?
you have been through a stretch like this at the beginning of a season before, 2008. you were the marked guy, the guy to beat. so this time around, are you able to enjoy it a lot more than you did last time? maybe can we talk about the quality, the feeling of this run you had beginning of the year versus 2008?
were you scared a little bit when you won in 2008, or did it feel like when was...
what's going on with your knee? you have an ice pack on it.
in 2008 you were a younger player. you're now not necessarily a veteran, but mid-career. for the last few years, federer and nadal have sort of set the scene and been sort of the role models for young up-and-coming players. do you see yourself now potentially as one of, not just one of the successful players, but potentially being a role model for players coming onto the tour?
what's your mindset when you go from one tournament to the next? when you are about to start an event, do you feel that this could be a good week or this might not be a good week? as a follow-on to that, how did you feel just before things started before coming in here?
are junior development programs increasing and improving due to your success in your country?
did you try warming up today, and then you found out that you weren't going to have sufficient freedom of movement to be able to play well? is that why you withdrew?
is this a decision you made yesterday, or did you decide this morning you weren't going to play?
do you know a little more about what's wrong now that you said you had an mri?
your reaction at the end suggested it was a very important victory for you tonight in all the circumstances.
can you talk a little bit about your service game? that third set you only gave up two points on your serve going into the tiebreaker, and only three points on your serve in the tiebreak, so only five in the third set. can you talk about how well you served?
let's talk about reading his serve because of the height, the toss.
do you think it's possible now that you're in the semifinals, perhaps you can relax a little? i mean, as you say, coming back after so long, every match is very important for you. you're a little nervous. perhaps now you played this number of matches, you can be a little bit more calm in the semifinals?
you did talk about how returning his serve involves a lot of luck. when you look back on the second set, do you chalk that up to just getting lucky and guessing right, or were you actually feeling it a little better?
what about playing juan martin in the next round? he's won the last three times that you have played. your head-to-head is very close. what are your thoughts on playing him?
you never seemed to quite get started. was it you or was it he?
where now, off to miami?
was he playing better than you expected?
in the second set you were behind; you hung in there, and then you started seizing in on him and sort of at the end it slipped a way a little bit. any reason for that?
on a service return, were you jammed on that dropshot where you tried to dropshot on the service return, or did you feel like you could pull that off?
on a service return you hit a dropshot.
that's why i was asking, were you jammed? it didn't reach the net.
when you say he feels confident at the moment, at what points? is it the weight of his ball? is it the risk he's taking? could you describe that?
you talk about the high-risk game and winning consecutive points and losing consecutive points. do you ever reconsider that style of play? that's just who you are?
from agassi onward you faced a lot of really great backhands in your life. what are the two or three best you think that you faced, andy?
you can usually rely on your serve to get yourself out of some trouble, but it seemed like he was really dialed in. did you feel like he was reading you effectively, which way you were going to go or something?
do you find there is a significant difference playing here in the morning versus the evening?
so it's to your advantage to play in the morning?
why did you give a warning to the chair umpire?
you're going to go into next week's tournament as defending champion. what's your assessment of sort of the season so far? how do you feel about it?
how important is it to you to stay in the top 10 in the rankings?
did you talk to ryan before the match tonight?
what did you tell him?
how do you feel you played out there today?
you got off to a quick start. how important was that?
it looks like you're probably going to play del potro in the next round.
can you talk a little bit about that match?
do you think you'll be feeling 100% then?
did you hurt your leg?
what happened?
how did you feel about the match?
did you see that he was a little hobbled maybe towards the end of the second set there?
how did you feel just when you got up this morning? everything good?
what did you expect from tommy today, knowing he's an experienced player?
it's not a bad result here, but, i mean, it's been a little bit of a frustrating start to the season for you. what, in your mind, is sort of holding you back from playing your best tennis at this point?
you have had some really great results at some of the smaller tour events, 250s and 500s. do you think there is something holding you back from going really deep in a masters or a slam?
are you frustrated at this point?
i thought you played a very solid match, but to win 6-love, 6-1 for the second time in a row, does it seem like you're playing outstanding tennis, or is it something that your opponents are doing?
he probably played his best tennis in the last game, just in time for your doubles, i guess.
gasquet is up one set. if you have to play him, what kind of match do you expect?
what if andy does turn it around and comes back to win, what do you do coming up against andy?
in terms of the players you've faced, who has the best backhand? is gasquet one of them, and wawrinka?
do you take anything out of matches like today and yesterday or the day before where you've only dropped two games in those two matches? do you take anything away out of those?
you've spoken about your increasing competence basically over the past six months or so, but do you also feel any additional pressures at this stage?
you probably haven't had a chance to hash it out. what would you sort of say after this little bit of time?
you seemed to have a bit of trouble on the forehand, putting a few into the net. was he giving you something that you weren't able to adjust to?
can you talk about that tiebreaker? seems like after -- i don't remember what the score was, but after, towards the end, he had a couple -- he missed a few of your forehands.
is it positive the way you came back in the third set and made it close?
did his game surprise you with anything?
is there a part of you hoping to get that opportunity to play roger?
shortly after you were born, daniel nestor won a big davis cup match for canada against stefan edberg, who was no.1 on the tour. now you are on the tour and he's still playing strongly in the doubles. do you feel there is a passing of a torch? what's your relationship with daniel?
has he expressed any relief that there's someone to sort of count on for those davis cup wins?
some players from canada has been critical of tennis canada in the past and how much of a financial burden it is for families to bring up future prospects. can you talk about your experience with that regard?
was there is a point you were frustrated with the support you were getting or your ability to get into the training academy?
you played an awful lot of matches the last few months. is there any element of that piling up, maybe you were a little flat today because of all the tennis you've played?
do you know what your plans are between now and your future in miami?
outside of yourself, do you know the top one or two or three athletes to come out of montenegro?
on your first match point, you hit a backhand passing shot, hooked the net and bounced up. you actually raised your hand to apologize before the point was over. do you remember that?
don't you think that's going too tentatively?
you said you're very new to the tour. what have been some of your challenges for you transitioning on the tour?
congratulations. can you take us over the match? i think the match had a couple match points and he broke back, kind of your mindset through that whole thing trying to figure out the match?
can you express in words what it felt like when that last ace was hit?
how much having actually beat him before helped going into today?
any explanation for how well you handled his serve today?
has your experience helped, your feelings from six months ago in new york?
you play a pretty good player in the next round. what are your thoughts about that?
how far back do your federer memories go?
roger was saying this evening he didn't know who he was going to play, but he was looking forward to it. he remembered back to 1998 when he was in your situation playing carlos moya in marseilles, who was ranked 4; he beat moya. what sort of mindset did you take into a match against the world no.2?
you haven't played him since 2008. how do you see his serve compared to how you played in the juniors?
no athlete or no team wants to have sort of a mindset of, gee, i'm happy just to be here. on the other hand, roger was talking at some point about all these big matches he had earlier, about moya or agassi or sampras. talk about a match against roger. is there just a value in your career to have a big match and what kind of mindset again?
did you say anything to milos after the match, when you shook hands or at any point after the match?
milos has had all this success this year. have you been watching it? are there things you watch and take notes and learn from the experience he's going through and apply to yourself?
that was a tough match.
i'm sure you weren't expecting a scoreline like that. how surprised were you with it?
when things are going so easily, is it a risk that you lose your focus?
another day i realized that you have a message on your knee which says support for japan. could you talk about why you did.
was there some problem with your left leg? i noticed it, but it was taped again under the knee and on the thigh; is that right?
16 wins in a row. could you comment on that?
can we say that it starts from the davis cup finals?
you know ana and jelena very well. they played now 10 times. they've known each other since they were kids. they're heros in the country like you are. when they play, there always seems to be a bit of tension and emotion. can you talk about the process of just trying to go out there and play tennis when there is a little more on the line than that?
so if you play him, assuming you play him the next day, regardless of who wins, you guys look like -- let's say you play a long and tense match, and then you have to go play doubles together. how does that go?
is that sort of the difference in that you and viktor are friends? and i'm not saying that jelena and ana hate each other, but they're not really friends.
so are you saying it's a bit different with women?
if you play llodra the next round, can you talk about the challenges his style presents?
i understand your decision not to play davis cup, so i am sure you were following it last week, week before last.
india ties it 1-1, and then they go into the doubles, it's tense. is there a time you were saying to yourself, oh, my god, maybe i should have gone over there?
it seemed like before the second set there the trainer came out to work on your left ankle. what was that all about?
is it something that you've had x-rayed or examined?
was that a match that got away, particularly with the first set when you had five set points in the tiebreak?
you should have withdrawn rather than play today?
is there a risk that you might not even play next week in miami?
did you consider withdrawing after you lost the first set? you didn't take a medical timeout, but you did have some work done on the ankle.
did you have issues with that foot your last match, your first match here?
but you were saying today maybe you would have withdrawn. did that cross your mind the last match, too, or even coming to indian wells at all?
to what do you attribute the rash number of injuries that's greater now than ever before? what's the reason?
do you have a feeling that you worsened it by playing today? or did it feel as it felt yesterday?
at davis cup, was it a fall or misstep or...
kohlschreiber had a 3-1 record against you before this match, and the one win was a tough one in rotterdam. does his game match up well against yours?
that's two very effective, impressive performances. you must be pretty satisfied with your game so far?
how about your doubles game? that's the important thing?
you always care about issues around the world. you played a lot of matches, charity matches. i was wondering, as no.1 in this sport, do you have any plans on japanese earthquake?
outside of hard court tournaments you have played, how does this surface rate in terms of speed and high bounce?
you really enjoy playing with marc. can you tell us about your friendship with him and how long you two have been playing together doubles?
actually in terms of keeping up the momentum, what happened to you last year losing as you did in the singles and then winning the doubles, i mean, andy murray is in that situation now. he lost in the singles and he's in the doubles. if there was no doubles here you would have then probably 10 days before...
milos raonic was in here last night saying that after his match with mardy fish he went to the net and he apologized to mardy for some of the things that went on during the match. he felt that maybe mardy thought that milos disrespected him in some way during the match, so he apologized after the match. when you were younger and coming up on the tour, how did you deal with situations like that? did you have older players...
milos said that he was bending over during the injury timeouts and maybe thought that mardy thought he was disrespecting him by stalling, something like that.
no, no, no. he went up to the net at the end of the match and apologized to mardy.
did you have older players that when you were first coming on the tour you would go to for advice on maybe how to act on the court sometimes? milos said he's new to the tour, so he didn't really know if mardy was offended or not.
you're talking about playing doubles here. would you ever consider playing doubles in a grand slam?
why not?
you spoke earlier about japan, but you've chosen to do some significant charity work in india. could you tell us about that, why you chose to do that work? aren't you doing charity work in india?
yeah.
did you feel like you were playing against an injured guy, or was it just a regular match?
what did you do really well?
you had two three-set losses in the last two indian wells tournaments, one to verdasco and one to djokovic, i think. are you pleased to get over the finish line against a top-10 player?
what if anything is holding you back from a place in the top 20?
looking ahead to dolgopolov or del potro in the next round, how do you see that?
your win today, you were talking about you're waiting for that breakthrough. do you feel like you could have that breakthrough here at indian wells the way you're playing?
so it's been a long couple weeks, i guess.
how is your energy level considering all those matches and the time changes?
can you compare your level of tennis this week to how you were playing in johanessburg?
most of the year you've had good tennis. how do you explain that?
when you saw isner break into the top 25, a guy you beat in college, did you say, i should be around there at this point?
i'm not familiar with your background. could you talk a little bit about how you ended up coming to u.s. and playing for university?
yeah.
when did you come to u.s.?
do you feel like there's another wave of sort of guys coming out of college that are making a statement in the pros, and a few years ago there was sort of an absence of that?
i'm talking more recently than that.
really none of those guys went past the top 50.
right.
with this win you're going to be ranked at least 65th in the world. can you talk about what kind of goals you had set for yourself at the beginning of the year?
how do you feel about facing the no.1 player in the world?
what did you learn specifically from the federer match?
do you still make your home in virginia or...
to get close to roddick? why austin?
i was just joking.
to be honest, you wanted to be close to south by southwest.
do you have a game plan already next match for nadal?
how much was davis cup sort of a confidence booster for you, as well?
would you be surprised if you pulled an upset over nadal?
how do you feel about your tennis today?
how is it playing james? we asked him about his rivalry with you since you have played a number of times over your careers. how has that evolved over the course of your career?
he's done so much on the circuit, high ranking, best american, portland hero, so forth, and so on. people still talk about him for some reason about being an underachiever. would you talk about that?
you were referring to getting to know james. can you talk about the evolution of your relationship with isner and his evolution as a player?
as far as james goes, how has it evolved between you between the lines? you've evolved your games over the last 10 years.
both austin where you live and san antonio where you do a lot of work are up for davis cup. which would you prefer? i could imagine. what would it be like for davis cup to be in austin, which is of course a great sports town?
raonic has come on the scene kind of suddenly. how would you compare him to del potro or anybody else? is there anything sort of special about him?
do you have any sense of how dedicated he is or how bright he is?
what's your thought on guys like him? he's 6'5", and more of these guys are like 6'5", 6'6". what's your thought on how that's shaping the game?
besides the serve, what's the presence of playing someone like that?
you have put efforts into your philanthropic, into your organization. can you talk about andre? he's been sort of a model to you.
when did he tell that?
did you go to his event?
can you talk about davis cup surface, assuming obviously clay is out. but if nadal, ferrer, lopez, verdasco all end up playing, i guess it would be a toss-up between fast hard or grass.
do you like the davis cup format? you're still committed to davis cup?
what would you change if you could?
how much time will they give us?
early in your career you had a similar run to raonic's rise up in the rankings. can you compare what you see and how he's handling it and how you felt you handled it at the time?
the last shot against him in the final in memphis, what would have been the goofiest follow-ups from it or people have said to you about it? how big a shot was it?
what did you say when you shook hands with him?
still, at the end of the day, does an athletic shot like that give you more pride, or really taking someone down with your legs and your condition like you did a couple sundays ago?
first match out here morning after a davis cup stint and traveling, how did you feel? talk about the match.
so you're a morning person. a lot of players aren't. could you actually get up and play a match if you were forced to at like 7:00 or 8:00?
what do you think coming into the tournament after the last couple months based on your results? how have you been playing? what do you want to do here moving forward?
when you get back on the hard courts, do you just sort of feel like this is where you want to be and you feel like things are clicking and you're more secure?
what do you think has held you back from playing your best tennis so far this year?
when you're talking to your coach about your return games, what do you guys talking about? i know you have been talking about it for almost a year now, trying to get better.
discuss that, and what do you think you can do so you can break occasionally to make it easier on yourself.
is it more getting the ball back in play, or are you talking about attacking second serves too?
obviously tennis can be a pretty brutal endeavor. you've had a lot of great wins, the ncaas, roddick in five, mahut, but also some tough losses, in particular santiago.
when you were going down, your rookie coach, coach jim courier, what did jim say to you? how did he help you out?
so do you think jim has potential to be a good davis cup captain for us? could you talk about his qualities he brings to the sideline?
you've been on the tour a few years now. is this the year where you feel like this is when i'm going to start peaking?
have you had any press conferences since wimbledon which haven't brought up the marathon, the match?
no, no, no.
general impressions of your progress at this stage?
this is probably as far as you have been in a masters series. can you talk about that?
does it feel like a breakthrough?
what was that discussion? i was there for the first set, and i left the second set and you had a discussion with the chair umpire?
that is the rule.
so she knew that he couldn't hit it back either, but...
he had touched it?
then you double faulted.
probably your best results since the open. in the last few months or since then, what do you think you've learned and what do you think has improved in your game?
how clear a strategy do you have in the match? because sometimes it's hard to figure out serve and volley on second serve, staying back.
i haven't seen too many second serves 109, 112. is that new? is that always how you go about things? it's not very safe.
you might play raonic in the next round if he gets through fish. you guys are similar in age.
what do you have to say about his game? he's obviously one of the biggest names on tour this year.
do you think at all about being a leader, being part of the next wave of the next tennis stars? we watch roddick who is 28, blake's 31. they're not going to last forever. do you talk about that with your coaches? is there a plan here two years from now?
that was the first time you beat him without losing a set. did it seem like it went a bit smoother for you?
paul annacone, is here and other tournaments severin luthi accompanies you. sometimes paul is referred to as your coach, but i have more of a sense you typically refer to him as joining your team rather than being "the coach." could you clarify that?
in our research center, we find that you get 2.2 seconds between the hits, and a lot of players are getting leg injuries and ankles, knees, groin, and so on. have you practiced changing directions softly, or what allows you to get away with not having some of the injuries some of the other players are having?
can you look ahead to the chela match?
no opponent is easy, but you have played so many tournaments, so many early rounds, do you ever have to play mind games with yourself, trying to get yourself motivated?
just following on the mind aspect, when you go out for a match, what's playing in your mind? what are you doing to yourself? are you psyching yourself up? is there an element of anger in there, or is it just focus? what is it?
how long have you been friends with gavin and gwen?
very quick turnaround between miami and monte-carlo, particularly if you go deep in miami, so what was behind your quite late decision to enter monte-carlo?
with the string and racquet technology advancing so much, do you think it's getting harder and harder for guys to get to the very top with a one-handed backhand?
if you could take anybody's shots, whose shots would you take? you're famous for your phenomenal forehand. what shot would you take from the other players?
how was the knee feeling today out there?
what's tougher, the loss right here or what happened in new haven to the crimson?
was that a battle between your forehand and his serve?
how is playing him over the course of your career evolved?
is it kind of tough seeing him so early, that you're going to match up against him so early in the tournament?
kind of a tough question, but you're a kid coming out of fairfield, going to harvard, good player, all-american, and then you take a jump to the pros, kick it in, i don't know, at times you had a stretch when you were the best american, the agassi match, great rsum and all of this, and yet there's still people that say, hey, blake, underachiever. could you talk about that?
the one thing in your career that you're most proud of and the one you'd change?
you talked about how andy's game evolved since you played that challenger. talk a little bit about how your tennis evolved, who the james blake was when you started playing andy and how it evolved.
do you ever flash on the forehands in crunch time in the agassi match at the open?
what would you say is wrong with your game right now?
you did say that you were in a sort of an experimentation mode. was it tough out there just to decide exactly how you wanted to play and what you wanted to do?
why was that?
a little bit of trouble with the knee? was there any...
you're playing on a different continent. do you think it's not something of surviving your first match, but playing another tournament on a different continent?
well, it is your first tournament here in the u.s. now and the circumstances are different. don't you think it's your first match then that's something of survival, just getting through that first match?
what's your big-picture assessment of young? obviously he's had some troubles. this is a big win for him. what do you see for his future?
you and jamie had an exciting win in the doubles last night. is that a bit of a silver lining that you look forward to?
the conditions, were they difficult? second part, how awkward was it playing somebody you hadn't played before?
you have quite a gap before your next match. what are you going to do?
do you think donald young will be successful in the next round?
not the perfect way to start a tournament to come up against somebody like del po.
last year you, when you were going to the net you were so efficient. this time you seemed to have a little trouble on your volleys. is that from lack of play?
can you tell about the injury that happened in dubai? what was it?
is that from the tournament in dubai?
you plan on playing miami, though, right?
when you came on tour, you probably were a guy everyone was looking up to in the height, but now you're looking up at guys like del po. do you think that's changed the game? do you think there is a place for guys...
you can't see a day when that is a real disadvantage, being under 5'10" or 5'9"?
how big is his forehand? when he won the us open, people were talking about 100 mile an hour stuff. i don't know if that's accurate. is it that big?
you served bigger than he did.
when you say off pace, you mean slower balls?
higher balls?
are you going to stay here for the rest of the week?
how does it feel to get past that round? everybody's been talking about your comeback. do you feel like that was the first round of your comeback?
what happened that first set?
watching you today, i noticed you look very confident in your forehand. i watched you a few weeks ago, and didn't look as good. you seem to be heading in the right direction. seems like you're really hitting the ball strong.
do you feel like you're playing almost at the us open level?
how far do you think you've come since you've started in sydney this year?
was there a level of frustration while you were recovering, or has it been pretty much an upward...
so you've been pretty patient?
how tired were you in delray beach? how long did it take you to get over that? you looked really...
so is the wrist 100%?
i just looked. you might play dolgopolov.
do you know much about him? he's come on in the last...
did you play him often in the juniors?
both ways or...
do you have a target to qualify again for the world tour finals at the end of this year, or are you not looking that far ahead?
that would be your first masters win, by the way. how are you feeling after that one?
you just served a 148-mile-an-hour serve and you're complaining about your serve?
you had quite a kick on your second serve. did you feel like that was throwing him off a bit and he was having to hit it back to you from...
5-4 in the second, did you tighten up a little bit? what happened there?
you have been really successful lately. do you feel like you have any pressure coming into this tournament to be more successful? what are your goals?
with this incredible run of yours and all the attention and the teleconferences and press conferences and hoopla, what's been the one thing that's surprised you the most in this recent period?
in what way? when you say the crowd respects you, do you hear people call out? does that encourage you?
there were a lot of canadian flags in the crowd. i guess you call them snowbirds down here. there was even a canadian gold medal hockey jersey hanging on one of the railings. did it feel like a bit of a home advantage for you that way?
i know you have a high-profile interview coming up. how are you doing with the demands on your time? are you comfortable with the new expectations on you?
you didn't seem to have too much trouble adjusting from the clay to the hard courts. is that a good observation?
on monday?
you mentioned this is your job, and obviously dealing with the media is part of that. how much have you enjoyed the media spotlight in recent months?
in tennis of course, unfortunately parents are often known to just push, push, win at all costs. you said you were brought up with a moral sensibility, moral quality. talk about your parents, who i understand are both quite educated, and what morals did they teach you?
a few words about playing against fish?
how did you hear about the earthquake and tsunami?
how did you hear about it? did you see it on the internet? did somebody text or phone you?
you say your family is okay. were you in touch with your parents at all? did you phone them?
where is your town? how far is it from the epicenter of the quake?
how many kilometers away is that, about?
how do you spell it?
did it affect your game in a way today?
did you get some support from players?
are you thinking of doing something for tennis?
what will you do right now? are you going to go back right away, or what's your plans now?
when will you go, have a chance to go back to japan?
how prepared are japanese people for these? i mean, nobody can prepare for a disaster of this proportion, but how prepared are you for things like earthquakes and like that? do you learn about them in school when you're younger?
were you wearing some sort of a black arm band? any plan to do that? sometimes that's happened before. have you been thinking about wearing something on your tennis uniform, like a black arm band?
just talk about the match. had a lot of chances in the first, scratched back in the second, got the breaker, got ahead in the third. must have been a long grind in the sun?
must have been nice though, gut out a three-set win against a guy who is pretty hot coming off of davis cup?
have you been in situations like that where you have a guy who was obviously disappointed he lost the second, and maybe not tanks, but borderline just says, forget it, i don't care anymore?
as one of sort of the great hopes of the game, do you feel a lot of pressure? and does it sometimes bug you, or are you cool with it?
you're known sort of for your tennis smarts. what would you say your greatest strength is? and to improve one or two things, what are the one or two things?
how important is a big event like this, people expecting so much from you coming into this?
is having your coaching situation or having it in flux, has that affected you at all?
outside of your family, what's the best single piece of advice you've gotten from a tennis person you know?
yeah.
you seem to be a strong, independent thinker. does that make it difficult for your dad to coach you full time? because obviously he knows a lot about tennis, but you have the whole father/son thing going on.
do you still reflect on the open grandstand loss? did you learn from it? how have you handled that?
i am just wondering what motivated you to do so well in the first half of the game?
do you think you're going to come back to china open next year? do you have any plans for the london olympics?
i was wondering, seemed by the second set you had given up. i was wondering, what do you think was the main cause for that seeing as you did so well in the first set?
congratulations anyway, marin. actually i'm interested in your doubles. do you and ivan have enough time to practice doubles together, and how do you prepare for doubles for major tournaments?
you did well in the first set; second set you broke back and seemed to be on fire. can you pinpoint a moment where perhaps tomas was just getting upper hand, or was there a moment in your game that you can now see that you started to go a little bit amiss?
just going to ask about the atmospherics. that was quite humid out there, almost unseasonably humid, and there was a bit of smog around. did that have any affect on your performance? of course it's the same for both of you.
congratulations. i think this is the first title for you in almost two and a half years, especially after not-so-good season compared to last. what does it mean to you, the championship?
can you just give is an insight into how you turned the game around. you were one set down and then it was really quite tight in the second tight. what was it? what was the trigger moment that you thought, yes, i could possibly win this?
what does this mean to you going into the rest of the year, particularly in the run-up to london?
how will you get that big cup back home?
it is reported that nadal and murray are going to call for a players' council next week in shanghai to talk about the schedule to the atp. are you going to join them? can you confirm this?
players' council talking about the atp schedule.
are you happy with the schedule? because they said that it's too much for the players. especially next year there is going to be olympics so the schedule could be really tight.
can you talk about your expectation in shanghai? back-to-back title?
congratulations. into the final in china open second time. in the past two meeting you lost, and today you also lost seven break points and break your opponent three games. how do you do that? and can you talk about the final?
could you talk about the atmosphere, maybe the challenge of playing in front of maybe less people than you would in other tournaments?
perhaps you could talk about your experience in china so far and what it's been like playing here.
first of all, congratulations to be back in the final again. how much like a confidence boost that you acquired at this china open for next year? as we all know, after the 2009 china open, you enjoyed a very good start to the 2010 season. talk about that.
sounds like you're feeling pretty good. tell us how you're looking forward to tomorrow's match, how you'll prepare for that? what sort of a match are you looking for? what sort of a plan are you going to bring?
hi, i'm a representative from the beijing student press association. seeing as last time you played against ivan you lost the match at wimbledon, i believe, however this match you won relatively easily. did you make my adjustments or go through any special training for this match?
(through translation.) tomorrow in the final, what is your tactic against your opponent?
(through translation.) in today's match, what do i think is the toughest for you?
today's match. what do you think is the toughest for you?
this match. what's the most difficult part in today's match against tsonga?
as a top player, you just enter your first final in seven tries this season. talk about in your mind what's the reason to make the players so difficult to play final with today's competition in the men's tennis?
czech will be one of the eight teams to compete in hopman cup in perth next year. can you talk about that?
are you going to play the olympics with petra?
jo seemed to take issue with the ball or balls. he approached the umpire and seemed to be saying something. did you catch what he was saying? is that the reason why his shots seemed to be going awry and going off? the second point is your ankle, you had some treatment on that in the third set. is that all okay for tomorrow and stuff?
congratulations. looked like pretty smooth sailing out there. give us your thoughts on the match and where we go into the weekend.
(through translation.) andy murray and rafa nadal went to tokyo to play the tournament; you came to china to play the china open. what do you think most attracted you here?
andy murray and rafa nadal went to tokyo to play the tournament there, and you came to play china open. what aspect do you think was it that most attracted you to play in beijing?
you beat roger federer twice in the past few months, one in wimbledon and the other is in rogers cup. tonight, you beat ferrero. how is your feeling in these three matches? what's different?
between these three matches.
can i ask another question? compared with before, it was roger, rafa, novak, and andy, so what's your strength and what's your weakness? please tell us what was your strengths and weakness.
(through translation.) what's your impression on the new stadium, the diamond?
what's the major difference between china open and the other big tournaments, like the grand slam?
just staying on this note, ljubicic said here has all the big stadiums, has the feel of a big tournament, yet it's moderately small, as the competitions go. what can do you think can be done then maybe by the atp and the organizers here to elevate the game to attract and make sure that it's a kind of must-visit by top stars like yourself?
how to make the beijing open a bigger draw for the players going forward given that it has the big stadium and the big-tournament feel, yet it's still new, perhaps.
(through translation.) how would you comment on your performance and on your opponent's performance for today?
(through translation.) in your next round opponent, ivan ljubicic is your compatriot and your couples partner. what's your expectation for tomorrow's match?
(through translation.) i've got two questions: you have been here playing china open. have you discovered something new in this year's china open? second question: in china open, from the very beginning they claim to become the fifth grand slam tournament. in what aspect do you believe that china open need to make improvement so that it will become the fifth grand slam?
in what particular aspect do you believe that the china open needs to make improvements so they can become a real grand slam?
(through translation.) in 2009, you reached the final in china open, losing to novak. this year, you have already reached the semifinal. there is one more step so you can reach the final again. only two more matches and you will be winning the china open. do you believe that here in china open it's kind of lucky place for you?
congratulations for your win. first question: talk about your serve, especially in the second set in the first game when you saved three break points. so what do you think about your serve? second question: your next opponent is ivan. no matter who win this match, one will be step into the final. since you and him are from the same sponsor, so what do you want to say to the sponsor?
(through translation.) comment on your performance for today. at the beginning of the match you were broken, but you staged a dramatic comeback by winning 12 games in a row. now you're getting closer to the year-end atp world tour finals. what you do you think?
with your win today, you're now 6-1 against verdasco all-time on hard court. why do you think you have been so dominant on that particular surface?
two questions. firstly, congratulations for your victory today. it's great to see that you perform so well recently. do you have any expectations that you can win the china open for the first time this year? and second question: you have stepped into the final of wimbledon last year. that's a great memory for you. do you think that some player, anybody like you or tsonga or fish or soderling, are able to create a situation that the top players aren't always dominating the grand slams?
it's not a surprise that you beat ze zhang, but would you like to say something more about this match?
your opponent said the biggest difference between you and him is the serve and the return of serve. do you think so?
is yao ming the tallest guy you have ever met?
i'm just wondering, where do you stand on the controversy about the atp schedule at the moment? andy murray of course has came out talking about how it's too full. what do you think?
this is debut for the china open new stadium. what's your comment about the stadium? next question is: for today's opponent, wu di is a young chinese player, so what's your advice for the future chinese young players?
your opponent said you took advantage of his weakness very well. can you tell us what is his weakness?
you're always a very consistent player, but your results this year dropped a little bit. talk about the reason behind that.
when you're going through a period like that when the results aren't coming, is it easy to tell yourself it's just a phase and you will get back, or you get very frustrated about it?
during the first set you lost two games and none in the second. what, if anything, did you improve to change your game personally?
what did you do to improve your game in the second set?
we all can see the big logo on your shirt. your sponsor celebrate your birthday in beijing, and you did the photo shooting for them. did you feel maybe a little bit extra pressure to do well near beijing?
what are your thoughts on that?
has his serve improved a lot in the last year, would you say?
you talked a couple days ago about the difficulty of controlling the ball in these conditions. a few flew tonight, didn't they?
usually what do you do before playing the match?
playing cards?
today?
did you win at cards?
what's the inclination now? is it to take a little bit of time off to reflect, or is it to get out to the states as quickly as possible and prepare for the hardcourt season?
the relationship with paul, you've spoken on the phone here, or has severin done it all?
has paul been able to watch the matches in the u.s.?
when you start a match and you play the first two or three games and get broken, do you feel is it going to be a bad one or...
you obviously dominated him in the latter half of the year last year, and then lost to him in australia and here. do you take anything away from that?
are there aspects of your game that you intend to work on specifically when you get to the states?
if you look at it long-term, do you think it's going to be between you and djokovic and rafa? is it going to be like three people fighting for the top?
some of that tennis you played tonight was so sublime, wasn't it?
how confident now you think that you can secure your no.2 ranking right now?
how did you size up the final playing novak so soon after the last time?
do you regard yourself as fortunate to have played every match at night?
how did you think the court conditions differ here? when novak played in the full glare of the sun, would it have been a lot quicker?
when get in a situation like tonight, 5-3 down, we've seen you turn it 'round so many times. how much of it is down to you upping your game, and how much do you think is opponents just feel the pressure?
other than winning, do you have any objectives for tomorrow's match, something special?
just a question on grand slams. it came up during the round table. when you look at the stats, and you nadal have one 21 and 23, do you have any sympathy for the guys out there that are trying to look up and see really a glass ceiling trying to get?
obviously you got great support in the audience. do you take it as an advantage, or also you get disturbed from time to time?
bad way of finish a good match. what was the problem?
when did it actually happen, or did it happen slowly?
was it because of the heat maybe?
was it a problem you've had before?
what's next?
you will try to see something is wrong?
congratulations on your win.
he really dragged you in the last set, kept you on court a long time.
in last 12 months, where do you see yourself? do you think you're growing well?
so the last six month you felt like it was getting better and better?
you said that sometimes you get a bit frustrated with yourself. when you lost the first set, though, you didn't. you seemingly had a confidence that you could turn it around.
that backhand was quite a weapon at certain points. you must have an awful lot of confidence from that shot.
roger up next, a player who you've given difficulty to in the past. i presume coming off a win like that you must be confident of doing so again.
how is the fitness going? i think we saw like the gap between and you gilles, we saw it growing throughout the three sets.
pretty routine, wasn't it?
when you say you knew a bit about him beforehand, is that because you watched him play or would it have been severin telling you?
has paul been in touch this week?
do you appreciate a bit more of a challenge as the tournament progresses just to maybe build up match fitness?
you had a little bit of a fight-back in that second set. what happened there?
when you haven't seen someone play, like you've seen him, watched him, but not faced him, does it take a couple games to kind of...
that's what you were saying that earlier, that you hadn't played him.
your devotion to your sport is exemplary. i remember a couple years ago indian wells, i think it was, you came into press conference and said, i was just having a long chat and tim henman about playing golf. like any swiss, you grew up with a pair of skis on your feet. andy murray likes to play football. i just wondered at the moment, in this time of your career, can you play or indulge in other sports or whether it's all tennis?
golf?
or cards?
did you meet with tiger here two weeks ago?
i saw a very nice picture of you today sitting there during the break, and there's a very big switzerland flag on your back. which makes wonder, obviously tennis is individual sport, but to what extent you also feel you represent your country when you play tour events like here?
talk to us about the beginning of the match.
you were saying the other day that you thought this court is as fast as most of the them.
so you perhaps played two during the day and one at night, so there must be a difference.
now, not wishing to throw this forward, but the final will be played at night. a certain other player has played all his other matches at night. do you have any thoughts on that?
what was it about his game early on that gave you some trouble? i heard you talk out there about a backhand slice.
do you think you also changed the match around partly through your body language? you clearly didn't panic. you gave the impression you knew you were going to turn this around.
is that something that when you're 5-3 down that you actually switch on, i've got to move up a gear?
you're playing berdych tomorrow. can you talk about that?
was there a point where you felt -- you know, i mean, because you won 7-5 and then he almost caved. i mean, was there a...
do you sense from the other side of the net that when he makes those mistakes that it's time to pounce?
your family has a tournament in your country. i'm wondering, when you travel to such a nice tournament like in dubai, did you draw the experience from the tournament in terms of organization and hospitality and use it in your own tournament?
besides you, who else have you got in the field this year? i remember you talking last year about wanting to get a few more players.
it's tough time of year, isn't it?
tough match, obviously.
novak was saying the other day that when the sun is out during the day that court is as fast is as almost a paris indoor court.
so the surface isn't that fast? i mean, it's not slow, but it's not...
us open was very quick last year, as well.
i think it took you sort of seven set points in the first set to win it. what were you thinking? because he's got good stickability; he stuck with you. what was the process behind that? just stick at it kind of thing?
he's quite inventive, isn't he? you can be in long a rally, and then he's throw in some perhaps unorthodox. does that make him a tricky opponent?
you might be playing djokovic tomorrow. probably your fifth game since wimbledon last year. what are your thoughts on that?
you were a wimbledon finalist last year; you made the o2; top 10 player now. but you still seem the sort of guy that can walk down any main street in any city in the world and not too many people would recognize you. do you like that, or do you want to be a star like rafa and novak and roger?
what about when you go home to czech republic? are you recognized there?
how about monte-carlo?
how do you feel about your game? how do you feel it's coming along now that you're in the semis? are there things you can improve on? things you're happy with?
your best performance here so far?
gave you a bit of a challenge in that second set, didn't he?
how were you able to turn it around so well from 5-2? he gave you opening, as you say.
you don't know who your next opponent will be, but it could be an all-french quarterfinal.
talk about the possibility of that.
are you pleased with the way your game is improving now?
you say your match against gilles could be difficult. i believe you've got a 4-0 record against him, although gilles beat you in sunrise, i believe.
you obviously are perhaps...
you said you were 7th in the world, and now you're 28th. moving up the rankings now compared to maybe a couple years ago, is it as easy as it was before? is it much more difficult? what's the challenge?
even in the top 5, is there any chance with the way the top 5 is now...
how would you describe the top 5 now? is it the best it's been? what's the gap between top 5 and, say, 6, 7, 8? is it a very big gap?
you were saying yesterday that your coaching setup has changed. is there anything different which perhaps ricardo or sebastien - sebastien will be with you in indian wells - but is there anything different they're trying to get you to do compared to eric deblicker?
we were very disappointed you didn't play your shot through your legs, your hot dog.
it was a good one, though.
you said after your match against somdev that you were just sort of pleased to have got through the first round, however you did it, but you wanted to progress and get better as the tournament went on. how do you feel you went in that direction tonight?
roger, it's a six-day tournament with a saturday final. you start the tournament yesterday, so you basically have to play every day from yesterday.
how do you think it's different compared to a seven-day tournament?
did you catch novak's game before you came out tonight?
in a match like tonight, is it easy to concentrate fully throughout the hour and ten minutes or so? because you won in straight sets, was it easy to concentrate all the time, or does the mind wander a little bit?
you don't think, what am i going to have for supper tonight?
in the second set, i mean, were you a little bit frustrated, because as you were saying earlier, that you didn't close it. looked like it was going to kind of roll through, he came back and it could have been 5-5 at one point. something like that, assuming you got a couple more rounds to go, i mean, do you get a little bit frustrated, how you come away with that experience?
after two matches, you've been playing quite steady, so far, do you kind of feel like home here playing in dubai?
do you feel like you're playing at home here in dubai because it's like for so many times you've been here?
atp announced tournament awards this week. of course the success of the tournament is combination of all kinds of things. for a top player like you, when you pick the best tournaments, what is the key factors, the most important things in your consideration?
worked hard for that, didn't you?
is there always a drop of concentration at the start of a second set if you've just won the first?
one of most attractive things about that match was the way both of you were willing to come forward to the net. do you think that's the direction the modern game is going in, which has been dominated by baseline for so long?
do you feel that's getting stronger and stronger in your game?
so is this the tournament where you're trying out some of these things, and with that comes with mistakes? is that something you wouldn't do at a grand slam?
you played here with your brother, your little brother, who is, i guess, still working on his game.
do you ever sit down and say, it's really important at your age to get ahold of the volley, to know how to play the volley?
how old is he now?
some of the rallies tonight looked exhausting, never mind playing in them. did you find yourself thinking during those points, i should come to the net now?
is feliciano someone you can learn from in that regard? he's quite confident at the net.
in the third set, seemed like 3-3 was the key, where you broke him back was the key. but, i mean, just overall in that set, the return was you think the difference for you?
you really came back in the second set. seemed like the first one was lopsided, but the second one was much more tight and you probably could have won it.
you were saying you were off for five months. was it illness or injury?
just a broader question, when you look at the grand slams, we keep hearing two or three names. you were a former no.3. how do you look at it now? is the fact that only two or three people are winning grand slams, is this good for the game? as someone whose trying to break back in and win a grand slam...
for you as a player, compared to when you started out, is it more difficult to reach a grand slam final now? now you're trying to get back up and hopefully win a grand slam. is it possible with the players at the top, or do you think that's not a goal you can achieve?
really tough match. you came through in the end very well.
i understand nikolay had a 9-1 record against you on the apt tour. had you thought about that going in, that this particular person has done quite well against you in the past? were you aware of that stepping onto the court?
you're one of only three seeds left in the draw. obviously the top three. it's opened up quite a bit. i think you're facing petzschner next. have you played him? what do you expect from that match?
your serve was really good today. coming out of today, what did you like about your game today?
in the past few years, when we talk about a grand slam and it's always about roger and rafael, and now we have djokovic winning the australian open. when we talk about rankings, we talk about big four, and but now soderling is no.4. do you feel sometimes it's opening up a little bit, maybe providing you more opportunity to do something even bigger this year?
seems like all the top players now play well on all surfaces. do you have a preference? you got to the semis in paris; final of wimbledon.
do you think as well there is less difference in the way players play on different surfaces now?
with grand slams, 21 or 23 have been won by rafa and federer, and now you have djokovic. as someone who's trying to break in, is this always the case, that 10, 15 years ago you think there would be a couple top guys a couple notches above everyone else, or do you think we are in a period that as someone climbing up the rankings, you look up and you say, winning a grand slam is more difficult than ever? how do you look at it?
going into a grand slam knowing that they're the top two or three seeds, how do you deal with that psychologically? do you think about that?
your reaction to the straight-sets defeat this evening? you must be quite disappointed to have lost.
you obviously had a winning record against him, 7-nil up. what were you trying to do out there? what did gilles do which caused you trouble tonight?
there were times where it was a bit nip and tuck and you are obviously quite well matched. do you think it was only small margins here and there? on another day you might have taken it to a third? how do you see it?
obviously it's different conditions from marseille; the court is faster as well. it's quite fast. is it difficult to acclimatize to the court?
is this the best he played against you?
many congratulations. your reaction to the win against mikhail, a seeded player here.
to mikhail's credit, he said that the previous games you had played had always been very close. this victory, it must give you confidence to beat a player of his caliber for the matches to come.
what was the difference today between the other seven matches, do you think?
that bad?
just more broadly, you have federer and djokovic in this tournament obviously. you've been up to no.6 and fallen back, right? just speaking for a lot of the players, i mean, at least in america when we think of tennis we think of the top 4. these days, how is it for you to think about breaking into the top 5 or even the top 10? is it much more difficult than when you started out? you've always been playing with federer, kind of up there. how does it feel to always know there's kind of a ceiling and it's very difficult to get past these guys in the rankings, even in the tournaments. talk about that a little bit.
do the top 20 guys, is it kind of you don't even think about becoming top 5? i mean, the goals are less because you know that...
so for you...
is it a question of consistency for you, gilles, sort of performing to your potential on a regular basis and staying healthy? because you have the potential to beat very best as you just explained.
good way to get into the tournament.
were you surprised by the amount of fight he put up?
seemed like 2-2 was the key. could have got up 3-1 there, right?
overall between playing nighttime and daytime, do you have a presence?
overall.
living here, do you watch other sports? did you come and watch tiger playing golf a week or so ago?
in some ways, does it feel like playing at home?
how did it occur in the first place?
yeah.
can you comment on the situation asian's men's tennis compared to seven, eight years ago? are they getting more and are they getting better?
what sets this tournament apart from most of the others, if there is anything?
just generally. you've come here so many times.
comfortable match for you pretty much.
were you surprised you played so well first match back after australia?
he gives you a target sometimes coming forward a lot, doesn't he?
your serve is one of the big improvements. obviously looked very good today.
how do you feel about the serve?
what's the thinking about playing more doubles this year, your brother today, murray in miami?
you still remember your first match after the 2008 australian open win?
with davydenko.
talk about experience in the past three years. you had another big win, so you're more experienced and get your focus back after such a big win. how did that happen?
what was the difference from today and paris? what did you feel you did better, perhaps michael did worse?
just tell us about your brother. how good a player is he, and what do you think he can achieve?
what was the problem?
when did you arrive and where were you? were you in cyprus or paris?
when did you arrive here?
not really feeling any better?
hindsight is great, but should you have withdrawn before the tournament?
did you feel dizzy on court? did you feel unwell?
in terms of the extent of it, do you know if you'll have to withdraw from any other tournaments?
has it affected practice? have you not been able to? have you been on the practice court or just not felt well enough while you've been here?
total of ten minutes?
what you can say about the match of yesterday and today?
you were aware yesterday as you told us there is too much big huge difference in the level. were you worried at the start of the match because of the huge difference between you and him?
how much this match will support you in the future?
what about the future of the game itself, the tennis game? do you think that uae have talented players that can give to this tournament or to the world in the future?
for the world?
you are pessimist.
what it's missing?
what facilities you mean?
is it expensive for you to play tennis?
not enough?
(question regarding qatar versus dubai tennis.)
for qatarian players?
is part of the problem as well that quite a lot of tennis courts have been taken up by hotels in dubai?
as emirate, did you get support from different government or companies?
the next six months for you, omar, i know the davis cup, but what's going to be your plan for yourself? have you planned something on the itf? are you going to any tournaments?
and how would it go with the other members of the national team? now that faisal bastaki is gone, you have hamad and mahmoud.
what was wrong?
which leg?
there?
did you ever have any issues like that before?
didn't turn anything on the court at all?
you have you done anything different in the gym or anything like that?
you went on the court thinking with the voltaren you could play?
the little that you saw of sergei, what did you think about his game?
what you experienced out there today is really unfortunate and bad luck, but mario today has announced that he's going to quit the. talk about the battle that he's had.
it's tragic, isn't it?
how much of him have you seen lately?
of course you have to wait for the evaluation tomorrow, but do you feel the injury might be serious enough to stop you playing indian wells?
do you feel it's hard for you to keep healthy compared like turning 30?
good to get off to a good start in each set, wasn't it?
set up nicely for the rest of the set.
each set today.
must be pleased with the way you played today then.
your serve seemed to be going well in the second set.
you said you were feeling sick. coming out of the match, do you feel like you could have gone longer?
what was your illness? was it a flu or something?
why, ernests, did you not play in the states this spring? you did very well, didn't you, last year in memphis and you won delray beach, didn't you?
you obviously had a lot of points to defend.
have you before played three different german player in first round of three tournaments in a row? it's happened before?
serious question. people always say how talented are. i'm curious, because talent is intangible. cannot be measured quantitatively. in tennis, how did you tell if a player is talented or not?
how important talent in tennis is? do you think it's most important thing, or it just can carry you for a certain amount of distance?
obviously you are seeded here, and i think michael was a wild card. when you saw the draw, is it a concern when you face a wild card or a qualifier?
what about the court? it's seemingly quite fast.
obviously andy murray has withdrawn with a wrist injury, and the top two seeds are at opposite ends of the draw. you're a seed here; a talented player. do you have hopes to go far in this tournament?
go home.
when i talk to you in sydney, you talk about in the hotel in china there are 20 people in the front desk to help you. you remember that?
the hospitality and service in dubai must be even more amazing.
well done. when he looked as though he might break through in the second set, you always came up with something good.
what are your confidence levels like at the moment?
what about that first set? you really got off quickly. how important was that? when you look back on the first set, what was the key?
he's talented but he's young. as a more experienced player, how do you take advantage of that?
are you happy with your year so far?
we all know that you're good enough to be right up at the top. what has to happen? what are all the things that have to happen for you to reach that?
what is your coaching situation at the moment?
what makes him useful for you, do you think, ricardo?
he will be your permanent coach?
has sebastien coached other players?
what does she tell you?
as a player that's going up, i mean, how does it feel when you look at the top, federer, nadal; is it impossible? how do you think about?
is it a ceiling, or do you think guys like yourself can break through? is there room for more than three or four players?
why is that, do you think? because you were in a generation, yourself, monfils, murray, djokovic...
i think you fell over in the first set. i don't know whether it's your natural gait, but you didn't seem to be moving terribly well after that. did that hurt?
not really the way you want to win a match, i would think.
did you sense early on that something was wrong, or did you feel like you were just playing amazingly?
you must have taken confidence from the quallies, coming thorough, and obviously the experience of playing on the court gives you a bit of an advantage to players coming in cold.
your percentage of first serve in was 100% in the first set. can you talk about that.
the ukraine is now the emergent tennis nation of the world, isn't it?
obviously with dolgopolov, and sergiy is getting good results as well. why do you think it's happening now?
do you see a lot of them? because you live in monte-carlo, so...
and for you, it appears from outside looking in that your focus was more on doubles play rather than singles a couple years ago; is that true?
when did you make that decision?
a long time ago i saw a picture of your dad playing tennis. how does good is he, and do you still maybe hit with him sometimes?
of course he was not a tennis player, but does he sometimes give you suggestions in general on sports?
will you be giving him a call tonight and letting him know how it went?
he is a world famous as a pole vaulter. would you at some point like to see your name above his? do you think that will ever happen?
were you ever tempted to pick up pole vault as a kid?
did your dad ever suggest tennis, or was that your thinking?
and then you worked with bob a lot?
for how many years?
what's your brother's name?
does he still play?
where do you think your game is right now, and where do you want it to be at the end of 2011?
not just ranking. overall your game, how do you feel about your game?
must have been really pleased with that performance. you played really well.
you were pretty confident of getting back the break early in the second set?
very strong finish. you won 16 of the last 20 points. how do you explain that?
the rain delay, in dubai of all places, it was good timing for you, in a way. obviously it disturbed jeremy's rhythm perhaps, and you could just regain your thoughts and assess how to get back in the set.
he started strong in the first set, and then you basically rattled off the last few games. how did you kind of break out? looked like early on he was up 2-1 and it looked like it was going to be a tight first set, and then you just...
you spoke about the difficulties of coming from indoor tournaments to an outdoor tournament like this. is that one of the main reasons why historically you have you have not done really well in this tournament? is that one of the major reasons?
how much do you think about ranking points at this time of the year, because come the summer, french open, wimbledon, you'll have a lot to defend?
not the result you were after tonight, but still a good preparation for next week?
you were quite emotional out there. what were you frustrated by?
was it tough in that second set tiebreak? the foot fault was a really tough call.
so are you ready to break another french heart tomorrow?
how much confidence did the davis cup give you as a player to take forward?
does this reminded you of the final of the davis cup playing gilles?
it was good for you to play so late in the season with the davis cup like that?
do you feel you almost have home-ground support in australia with all the serbian support?
how do you feel like you played today?
what do you feel like you can achieve this year? have you set goals?
will michael llodra always remind you - will you have good memories when you see him again?
you're drawn to play novak djokovic in the third round if it goes to seeding at the australian . how did you feel about that?
so that was quite a firey match from your opponent. is that what you expected with him?
it clearly didn't affect your concentration when he was upset.
so you could tell that he was fading, he physically wasn't quite as sharp as he had been at the beginning?
were you surprised just how badly he faltered in that last set? i think it was three points in total he won.
you're drawn to meet roger federer in the early rounds next week. do you have confidence after your performance this week?
second round.
could end up being a france/serbia final, back to davis cup.
how do you see the match playing out if it is troicki?
has it created more rivalry between the french and serbian teams having just played a davis cup final?
how close is this week to your best tennis since the knee injury? is this as good as it's been?
what happened? you were very winning the game and then...
only three points in that second set. it's not often.
having felt that sort of physical deterioration in the second set, has that happened to you anywhere else? has that been an issue for you previously?
so your little explosion when you lost the break at 5-4 in the first, was that because you realized that that was your big chance gone?
what will you do between now and the first round of the australian open to get your body back into shape?
did you consider pulling out in the second set?
but do you think someone might think you didn't try hard enough in the second set, maybe an issue of tanking?
when you broke your racquet, did that break your concentration?
something is related with the quality of gilles today?
the way you play in the beginning was huge level, and at the end, the gap is very large. can you explain this? you tried before, but it's very...
why did you decide to give your racquet to someone in the crowd?
how far back do you have to go for your kind of worse set than today's? how far back? have you had a worse one?
seem to be having a good run against the french lately.
that davis cup give you a great deal of confidence in such trying circumstances, deciding tie and to win in such an emphatic fashion?
is it hard to come down off a high like that? it was only a month ago, and now you're playing tennis again. is it hard to readjust?
has your profile changed at home? obviously novak is very well-known at home and worldwide.
it was a tough match today. were you nervous when richard brought it back to 4-3?
what do you think went well for you?
into the semifinals. how do you feel you played today?
how is your confidence leading into melbourne? 2009 was, i think, your best result in a grand slam there, so you must enjoy it.
you couldn't play last year because of your knee.
do you feel like you're still climbing back to your best from the knee injury? obviously your ranking is still down from where it was before.
is there anything in particular you focused on in your off-season training?
when you came back from your knee injury, were you moving well or has that just improved gradually since?
what's the state of french tennis like at the moment? obviously still lots of competition and lots of players in the top 100.
are you far away from turning your mobility on the court back into a real strength?
who would you like to avoid in the draw for melbourne?
i presume you've been doing specific work for your movement the last few months off-court.
so how did you learn to trust the right knee again?
today's heat, melbourne tends to be pretty hot. is this a good preparation for the australian open?
four wins here. you must be happy with your form.
relieved to get a wildcard into the aussie open?
how and when did you find out about the wildcard yesterday?
before you went on court?
are you a bit surprised about the attention in some circles that you're getting about getting the wildcard? a few people have written that it sort of can be too easy for you, et cetera, and maybe some agendas and things like that. what are your thoughts?
and todd's comment that before the qualifying here that you hadn't done enough, your thoughts on that?
what does playing matches do for your game? how does it change or improve your game?
you've had two great australian opens; got a wildcard and got through to the second round. there will probably be expectation that they'll want you to do that again. you prepared for all that?
you told us how much taller you've go. tell us some of things that you've seen in your game that's much better or more improved than it was 12 months ago.
going back to the wildcard, are you surprised at all that certain people get on your back about it? do you feel you deserve it? people are be a bit harsh on you?
how fast is your top serve?
it's come around.
do you feel unforced errors are a problem in your game still?
what went wrong today?
what about the scheduling out on court 6. was that a weird one for you?
your bad luck as a top seed continued today. what went wrong?
how does that place you for the aussie open? now what are you going to do?
a lot of the top guys play with that. is that why you wanted to try it?
is that because of the humidity?
did you feel any more pressure or responsibility when you're a top seed? does if affect the way you play, determination?
never easy to play a player like del potro, a player of the quality of del potro, even though he's been off injured.
one half of the draw has opened up for you with baghdatis not there. is it a good feeling for you this week in sydney?
you lost to del potro for a couple years now. tell us, playing today, what kind of level is he at, do you think? he's obviously still coming back.
how did you feel about that?
is that positive considering where you've come from, sort of a long injury layoff?
you usually do pretty good here. are you disappointed this time round you couldn't go through?
are you able to make qualifying just by making the main draw here?
what was that like, knowing that?
a wildcard wasn't a possibility for you heading to the australian open?
you weren't on the list. was that surprising at all?
what's the goal for this year? former top 100 player.
what is your goal for the year?
what have you liked most about the way you've played this week, the main positive?
what about davis cup? has pat spoken to you since he took over?
still a goal, though?
overall heading into australian open, how do you rate your preparations?
you wanted three or four hours of match play at this tournament. i don't imagine you would imagine you would get all of them in the first match.
is it more of a physical test?
are you surprised by the you were physically as well?
what does it mean to you to finally get that win after nearly a year?
you don't feel any pains in your wrist?
how do you rate your level compared to the one when you won in new york?
did you expect such level? because some of the forehands were already very...
what has the win done for your confidence?
having not played a match like this for a year, how much do you think it will take out of you for the next match?
how far away do you think you were from your best out there today?
but it must be a great relief to actually feel progress, you have to a result that shows you're making progress after a year.
number seven. how does it feel?
nearly three hours and another hard game today. physically how do you feel after those two games?
you were in the finals of indian wells and miami. that is an awful lot of tennis to have played in a short space of time. it's hard to believe that someone can keep playing that level of tennis week in, week out.
aren't you afraid to play too much? you're thinking about barcelona, madrid, rome, paris. is it not asking too much of your body, something that worries you?
it's you who decides the schedule. some years ago you said you were playing maybe too much. is there something you're going to do if you always reach the final, maybe skip one tournament?
there are these four or five one after another.
can you talk about the sensations you had on the court for your game throughout the week.
you say you're more nervous. is that because of the three finals you lost?
you said last year you played maybe your best tennis on clay here.
this week was not the same. for the confidence, what is the difference between playing so well or winning without playing so well?
is more difficult to win a tournament seven times in a row or a grand slam tournament?
you keep saying that what you're doing is almost impossible every time you win a tournament. it's impossible to win the french and wimbledon back to back. you do it. you're almost making the impossible possible.
you're proving yourself wrong almost.
another question difficult for you to answer. do you see yourself still playing for how long? i don't know if you know it. when you think about yourself, do you think, when i am 29, i'll still be playing like federer trying to win, or you think maybe it's too long?
it was a huge fight today out there. how close were you in the second set?
do you have regrets?
you played nadal a lot of times. what are your thoughts about this match today?
do you think there's a chance nadal will never lose on clay in his whole career?
compared to rome, do you think it was closer this time?
people tend to under-evaluate you in relation to nadal, federer, the other top players. do you think after this final, which you played very well, that you will be more considered by tennis fans, by the media also?
you played a great tournament, especially with your return. is it a good sign for the rest of the season on clay?
you reached the semifinal last year, final this year. are you going to win this year?
that was a very demanding match today. how pleased were you to come through it?
going into the third set, what were you wanting to adjust?
the start of the match was a bit weird because it was delayed because of andy's elbow injury. how did you adapt to it?
you said sometimes there were five shots and it was right back where you started. that's usually how opponents feel when they play you. you felt today murray was getting you into uncomfortable positions?
is andy a much different player now than when you played that match against him a couple of years ago in the semifinals?
when you play best-of-three, if you lose the second set, you always win easily the third set, 6-love, 6-1, sometimes 6-2. that means you are so much stronger physically than all the others. that helps you to grow the confidence for best-of-five sets in roland garros?
especially if you're stronger physically.
before the beginning of the match, did the atp ask you if you agreed to wait?
a word on david ferrer tomorrow.
i presume a very bittersweet end because you played some sensational tennis and we clearly saw you having some trouble with your elbow later on, maybe during the whole match.
what did the doctor say it was?
was it quite a frightening decision whether to have the cortisone injection or not?
given all that, you must be pretty pleased with how you played.
tactically, what did you feel you were doing well, especially in the second set, which you dominated?
there was some games that were extraordinarily long. in those circumstances, normally on clay, those are the games that he would win. you were the guy who won those games today. from that point of view, your patience and ability to see those games through for the long-term...
you wanted to have the treatment you got after the second game in the final set. what happened there? you seemed to be having a discussion with the guy. he wouldn't let you have the treatment.
being so close to nadal on clay is nice news for the coming weeks.
what does it mean for you getting to the final of monte-carlo?
looks like it will be an all-spanish final again. i know we shouldn't say that, but we know what he's like here. what is it about spaniards and clay? why do you love it so much?
did you expect to play so well from the first clay court tournament?
if it is rafa that you play, do you believe you can beat him?
how easy was it to beat melzer today?
talk about the beginning. were you scared?
what makes rafael nadal more difficult to play on clay specifically? what is it in his game that makes him more difficult on clay?
do you think that rafa is the fastest player on the court?
there were some close games there, but overall it was a very solid performance from you.
were you surprised about federer losing?
he said it was almost seven years he was not losing to any left-handers, apart from you. do you think this has something to do with his defeat today or just the wind? melzer is left-handed.
i'm asking if you think the fact that melzer is left-handed had something to do with the defeat of federer today, or if the wind was probably more important?
15-40, when you were serving for the match, you got out of trouble very well. were you pleased with the way you managed to get out of that?
when it's windy, it's difficult for everybody to play. do you think it's more difficult for people that have a flat game than your type of game?
do you feel stronger every day?
can you tell us something about melzer? you lost to him last year. what is your opinion on him and on his way of playing?
just a couple of blips today. other than that, another excellent performance from you. must be pretty satisfied.
are you happy the way you struck the ball?
now the semifinal against rafa on clay. what do you think?
what do you remember of that second set you played against him here in the semis? you played him very close in that set.
you've played him on every surface. what makes him such a difficult player on this one?
is the challenge of playing rafa on clay the biggest there is in the sport, do you think?
will you approach that match almost as if it was a final because you're playing rafa?
you usually play very well against rafa. is that because there are no doubts in your mind about how you have to play against him?
you mentioned the mental aspect. you've spoken about david haye helping you with that. has he contacted you since the win today?
nice to hear some acclaim for the dropshots today?
how much information did you grasp from hitting with rafa on the backcourt?
was it the perfect match today for you?
does it have a special meaning for you to beat federer for the first time?
what did you learn? you lost three times to him last year. what was different about today's match?
do you think also the clay is a reason for you?
is it yours?
what happened with your back in the beginning?
how high?
roger missed seven breakpoint chances. he will say some of that was bad luck. do you think some of that was your aggressive approach?
you stayed focused through all the match. is it the difference between this match and maybe the past few weeks?
you have a clay court specialist coming up next. what do you think of the match coming up?
you've been asked many times about muster, who was so successful here. now you're in his tracks. what do you feel about it?
are the players are losing a little bit of the respect against federer?
a lot of people think nadal is unbeatable here and on clay in general. if you beat ferrer, chances are you'll meet him in the final. what is your mental approach to that kind of game?
you're not at the end of your career yet either. if one day you will meet your son, you will tell him first, i beat nadal once, or you will say, i beat federer once?
david, there are players like ljubicic in his 30s. we have roger and jurgen out there. you're in your late 20s. these players are playing very good tennis slightly later. why do you think that is?
you seem to be playing as well now as you've played. your level this week has been terrific.
what is your feeling about the game conditions here, about the court? is it slow, fast?
would you say it was an easy match today?
you played against him two years ago. how would you describe now? is it better?
it was more difficult for you today than last time?
you seemed to have no problem switching to clay.
(question regarding the wind on the court.)
did you feel a little bit off your game from the start? was it more a case of how well he played?
does it make a difference to lose to a player who is not djokovic or nadal?
what i meant is to lose to nadal and djokovic is more acceptable for you. melzer is not of the same standard, even if he's a top-10 player.
what will you do the next couple weeks?
anything in particular you'll use that time to work on?
both madrid and rome are masters 1000. what is the different approach for you? how do you react to them? do you see any difference, madrid, rome, different tournaments?
could you first talk about the first part of the match to 5-3, set point.
what was the general idea against him?
what about your ankle?
you never thought of retiring?
the crowd was not very happy with those dropshots. what did you think?
what is the diagnosis for your ankle?
don't you believe those health problems should stop?
the crowd was booing murray. what do you think of that?
did he sympathize with you at any stage?
shouldn't you work on your body to try to prevent all those injuries?
generally speaking, you are playing well in this period.
what is your feeling about the match of today? the end of the second set, more tight, but a strong start.
richard said when the ball is on your forehand, for him it's like the point is nearly over. did you feel the same when you were going for your forehand?
yesterday and also the day before you played around the club and the restaurant. today there was construction. can you hear that? does that disturb you?
did the conditions of the court at first seem a little more wet when you started the match? did that make a difference throughout the game?
and what about your next opponent, ljubicic?
do you think your preparation for the clay season is totally the same as the previous years or are you planning to change something? every year it looks like you play better and better, new shots. do you plan to change something in your preparation?
for the clay.
on clay do you change your tactics against a player like djokovic? after miami, do you feel more of a challenge against him? would you use different tactics than you did before?
always difficult to play against an injured player. but what is it like to be jeered?
he said exactly the same thing.
encouraged by your performance before and after the injury?
do you know much about your opponent tomorrow?
what were your feelings about the people, the crowd booing at you?
did you think at any point he might pull out of the game?
looked very comfortable out there from the start. are you happy with your clay form right now? you spent more time preparing this year than you have before.
do you think it's possible for you to win the tournament?
your serve is better than miami and indian wells. did you focus on that during these days?
what was your impression with cilic?
what is the influence of the sponsors with you? for instance, this is a rolex masters. do they push you in a way or ask you, why don't you play monte-carlo because it's rolex, or no? do those kind of things happen?
you know tomorrow there is a rolex meeting with the media. do they ask you if you would like to appear or they don't even dare?
they don't dare (smiling).
you wouldn't wake up at 9:15 when we are supposed to meet.
the end of the match was very tight. were you relieved you pulled it out? it was a good fight.
what happened at 4-1, double break? were you tense?
how can you compare this match with the first one?
what can you still improve in your game on clay?
your next opponent will not be a clay court specialist.
are you happy your ranking has improved? you wanted to be top 20. i think it's almost done now with this victory.
you seemed to have a good start of the tournament for you today. how were you feeling?
obviously this tournament, the upcoming ones, are important to you. at this stage, do you already have one eye on roland garros? do you try not to peak too soon?
what do you expect with federer on clay this season?
with the rivalry with you. what do you think?
did you have all your sensations back on clay today?
what do you remember from your semifinal here against richard six years ago?
he said from since then, you won six titles here, he only won six matches in the tournament, and now there is a huge difference between the two of you. how do you imagine the match tomorrow?
when you say he's coming back, do you think he can get back to the level he was three or four years ago, beating roddick at wimbledon, be a top 5 player?
18
what is your attitude to records, to numbers? do you give importance to them or not that much? you know you won six tournaments here in monte-carlo; you won 30 matches without losing a set; 33 in a row; 72 sets. nobody has done more than 70, except muster and nastase. are these numbers somehow important or you don't really care that much?
jarkko hit the net cord today in the match, but you still won the point. do you feel sometimes that when you win such points, that your opponents, you're breaking their will or they're losing confidence or...
is it more difficult to find your serve on clay?
about gasquet, do you think he will be a permanent top 5, top 10 player in the next few years?
it's not fact, but do you think he can get back there regularly?
but can he?
one assumes you're feeling a lot better about life at the moment after that.
the end of the match was getting pretty tough. do you think maybe a lack of confidence you have now explains how hard it was to close it out?
is this a good surface for you to come back and get back in the rhythm of playing, confidence and everything else? it's not known as your best surface, but do you like it?
you mentioned it's a game of inches. people talk aggressive tennis. you've said, what is aggressive tennis? it did seem as though you were playing ever so slightly further up the court, taking the ball earlier today.
explain roger and rafa and what you think about the tournament?
have you seen them play?
thoughts on your next opponent, gilles simon?
enjoy the court? it's great when you have almost a full house. a lot of people coming back in, really relishing it.
you only dropped three games. it was a good match.
how do you explain that it was so easy?
against nadal, you were saying you have nothing to lose.
is it different now than when you played him last time?
how can you give him trouble?
but today you were able to move forward on the court.
most players think when they play nadal on clay that they're just going to be wiped off the court. how can you prepare for a match like this?
you played him more than six years ago. is it even more scary to play him on clay now?
is it difficult to deal with his topspin?
with nadal, is he totally predictable?
do you think he should worry about playing gasquet?
you will play in front of a french crowd tomorrow. do you believe they're going to support him or you? is it going to be difficult for you?
is it going well with ricardo when he briefs you?
what did you improve lately?
how is your shoulder?
you must be very disappointed because that match was not out of reach for you.
you're playing better. at 4-3 you got broken back. at 3-1 you made a couple of mistakes at the net because you were rushing.
that's what i saw.
but if you lack confidence, isn't it worse approaching the net all the time?
what is your schedule now?
are you going to play doubles with gal, again?
so it's only for winning, not for pleasure?
well, your start was very convincing. are you happy?
you seemed very relaxed for your first match at 10:00 in the morning. you were in a good state of mind?
it's your 200th victory. do you remember them at all?
is this 200th victory going to be a special memory for you?
do you remember last time you won a doubles match?
wasn't it with safin?
but don't you believe this could happen you, playing doubles?
oh, we'll watch that.
for your next round, who do you think?
he has a regular clay court game?
what did you like most in your game today?
you're imitating federer, being so relaxed?
we call you 'the guy from nice.' what are your ties with that city?
what did you think when you lost three match points, five points in a row? were you a little bit worried?
are you a little bit surprised you've won these two matches so comfortably?
the time you spent in barcelona last year, is this paying dividends now?
you seem to move better and better on the clay. you were moving better than the first round. are you surprised you're getting more comfortable on this surface?
is it tough to the focus, to play against a player like ernests?
in the next round, it's going to be one guy or another that's there for five hours. can you break down either lpez or ferrer?
you have a coach with some inside knowledge.
do you think there is a big gap between the way you play on hard court and clay?
how much have you played on grass?
are you looking forward to trying?
what is the major problem on clay for you now? is it sliding, the footwork?
did you watch the masters, the final day of the golf? there was a young player, mcilroy, who kind of fell apart in the closing stages. how important is it for you, at your age, to develop the mental aspects of the game?
most people, when they come to their first time in monte-carlo, are stunned by something, a car, a person, sights. is there anything that particular you've gone, my goodness, what was that? i might buy one of those one day.
maybe hugh grant tweeted about seeing you in the restaurant.
was he with a beautiful woman?
you were the better player on the big points obviously.
you seemed to feel the ball quite well, doing dropshots the end of the first set. did you feel the ball really well?
you obviously feel at home here.
it was a little bit difficult for you in indian wells and miami. you seem to be fully fit again. how do you feel about your game?
during the conference tsonga said he thought that he was a lot better player during a set and a half. do you feel that way?
you also said yesterday your game fits well to bother him.
what did you like in your game today?
you've shown a lot of consistency in your will and energy. before you only had one hour and a half autonomy and now you seem to be able to play more than two and a half hours as you did today.
so you had no problems with the transition to clay?
and playing tomorrow again, is it okay?
it's a new situation for you now without a coach. you can't look at him during the match.
but how is it without a coach when you are not playing a match?
without a coach, after a match, you don't have to go through the debriefing process either.
are you going to stay without a coach for a long period?
do you have offers?
can you give us some names?
can you then give us a number?
are you disappointed? the first set was tight with the tiebreaker.
you had a wild card here in monte-carlo, so you were very eager to do well maybe?
what about your career...
what about your program now?
for this first-round match, you started badly but were able to turn it around. are you happy that you won?
you were talking about tension. why was that?
last time i've seen you play here was 2002. do you remember against whom?
i rarely make a mistake, but at that time i said you would become world champion.
so what do you lack to have a better career?
is the transition to clay more difficult than other transitions during the year?
overall, there's a feeling you came back pretty well this year.
is it difficult for you to adapt to clay?
is that the most difficult transition?
but you are reassured about your tennis level now?
you have your best ranking in two years. we see you enjoy playing. does the fact that now you are again in the top 20 put more pressure on you?
after the score was 3-all in the first set, you won 6-love, you lost 6-love, and you won 6-love. it's crazy. it looks like women's tennis.
had you not played a challenger match or anything on clay through choice or...
the week in barcelona, clay training, did you pick up a lot from that?
what is the biggest challenge for you for your game physically to adjust to clay?
do you think you can have fun on it?
is movement perhaps one of the most crucial elements in the transition from hard courts to clay, getting your feet in the right spot?
did the fact you played him and beat him in australia, when you got to one set all, did you think you could beat him even though it was different circumstances to today?
who were you training with in barcelona?
in the end, do you like to play on clay?
it seemed out there you had to improve many shots like your serve...
you seemed to be more confident during the u.s. summer. now do you have doubts again?
on top of these difficulties, the draw was not easy for you here. how did you manage the situation?
so the situation is tough for you at present. what are you going to do to change it around?
when you started working with patrick, did you have a specific deadline in mind while you were changing things in your game?
before you used to work sports psychologist. do you still do that now?
what are you going to do in the next days or week?
nikolay said that that was the best you had ever played against him. if he's right, and considering you've played 16 times, that's saying quite a lot, isn't it?
you seemed to play a lot of fast rallies and hustle him a lot. was that one of the things you were trying to do?
you usually say that you like to win the tournaments, but as preparation for a grand slam this was pretty good as well, wasn't it?
after you won the first tournament in 2011, do you think you will get back to no.1 this year? what's your steps for that?
do you think it would have been different for you today if you were playing against nadal?
well done on winning the doubles.
you how do you feel now? do you feel any better or not?
we could see almost immediately that you were not very well. were you actually worse today than you were yesterday?
you said that you only had four days' rest between the seasons. is that part of the reason why you're unwell now?
what will you do now? will go directly to australia?
so the reason for staying is to get healthy, is it, the reason you are staying here?
if you win the australian open you'll have all four grand slams. is this in your head, or do you keep that out of your head?
obviously it's been a very tough week this week. there has been a lot of people that's lived with you, all your fans, especially, globally. is there a message that you'd like to give them because of your condition? is there anything you'd like to say to them?
in terms of your performance this week. is there a message for your fans?
very entertaining second set. were you pleased with the level?
you also finished the match very well. you didn't drop a point, i think, for 18 serves, something like that.
the computer also shows that you're playing more often inside the court the further this tournament went on. is that a deliberate attacking emphasis that you're introducing?
could you give us a sentence each, please, depending if it's rafa or nikolay that i play?
first tournament of the year and another final. how do you feel?
but why do you say you're surprised? you certainly have the game, and you've won here in doha. why do you say you're surprised?
what do you think your level is now? is it similar level to here last year or not?
and how did you feel before the match today?
so do you think your best tennis is still to come?
it doesn't look you have to be nervous for the final. you have such a good record. you won the last six finals, so something special where you go on the last day of the tournament?
i'm gonna push it some more. federer said today that when you're healthy, when you're fit again, that you should be a regular player in the top 5. so what are your goals for this season?
which memories you have about your match against roger in australian open last year?
can you tell us about your coaching situation? i think you had stopped working with your brother last year? are you back with him? can you tell us everything behind it?
of the four grand slam tournaments, is the australian open the one where you think you have the most chances of going far?
that was a very tight, close match. you produced some of your best tennis on some of the biggest points. was that the main reason you won?
you're being very critical, but why did you not play your best tennis sometimes, do you think, or what might be the reason?
when you got your biggest weapons in, you nearly always hurt him. you nearly always either won the point or got control of the point. did you always feel that you had a big weapon ready if it was needed?
you have big weapons. you have a very heavy forehand, big serve. did you always feel that you had an extra weapon if you needed it, if you were in trouble?
some people think that you will be the winner; not federer, not nadal. why, you think?
i'm asking you.
what do you want to say for the french spectators today?
can you comment on your level today against troicki, please?
you are playing against tsonga tomorrow in semifinal. would you like to tell what you are feeling for this match?
compared to the match in semifinal in australian open, did you remember some things?
since you start now, are you ready, let's say, for the final? especially that nadal and federer, they are here and they passed the first course of the champion?
are you ready for...
are you proud of the way you fought?
what did you tell yourself at the start of the third set?
are you taking any medicine or seeing the doctor?
did you hesitate to play this morning? did you hesitate to play this match?
and in doubles, too?
do you think you will be able to be 100% tomorrow?
almost the same thing you met today, for federer met so many difficulties to win his match. what does this mean for the two best classified players compared to the others? can we wait for something, for surprises?
you don't feel privileged? you don't have feel you have privilege compared to the other players?
that you are no.1.
well, happy new year.
first match, a win. just a little bit, your impressions after this break? did you have enough of a break? how are you feeling overall?
would you like to tell us what you did until the final of london and now, abu dhabi?
is it enough to feel fresh for this year?
what about this goal to win four titles, grand slam titles in a row?
yesterday you feel bad during the double or after?
this morning you were okay?
roger yesterday said that an offseason should last between six to eight weeks. that's what he would like. an offseason should last between six to eight weeks. do you agree with that?
he wishes the offseason would last between six to eight weeks.
yes.
i know it's just one match into the new season, but are you happy with your form?
two, including the doubles.
let's make it three. are you happy with your form, the way it's shaping up?
is it good to know that you're sharp enough to save three set points and six breakpoints as early as the first round of the tournament?
how did you feel you were hitting the ball?
i've seen you hit winning hot dogs when you're running away from your opponent before but not when you're facing him. why did you decide to do it then?
for the last few years you've been a player climbing up the mountain. today you had opportunities and became closer to the top of the mountain. do you take something positive from how hard you fought today?
obviously you're not happy with the results. could you tell us a little bit more how you evaluate your game today?
yesterday you said that you weren't going to play a baseline game with novak. did you manage to get to the net as much as you wanted to today?
you mentioned the energy it takes for you to get to this state in a tournament. does it make you appreciate what djokovic has done this year?
is he beatable?
golf is going through a different discussion than tennis. they're lamenting the fact there is no dominant player. do you believe a dominant player helps or hinders a sport?
what is it about the sport of tennis that you love so much that you're willing to keep putting yourself in these positions and keep going for it?
you won big prize money this week. are you going to invest in the stock market?
you have more confidence in your game than the stock market?
you looked a little bit tighter today than you have all week. did you feel as comfortable today as you did leading up to today?
is mardy difficult to play in that he throws so many different looks?
you were talking about the positive things that happened this week. what is the most positive thing that you'll take into the next two or three weeks of the hard court season?
you said yesterday you had a plan for mardy fish today. did he do something that mixed you up or surprised you on the court?
novak said yesterday that he would love to face you in the final. was that in the back of your mind?
(question about how well he has been playing.)
not many problems today.
in washington, d.c. last week in the interesting press conference you did with us, you were speaking about the difference between a player who tells himself he can win all the time and a player who really believes it. how would you characterize what happened within your mind that took you from that first group to the second group?
janko said earlier he was very surprised by how often you came to the net. was it part of the game plan or...
how impressed have you been by what novak djokovic has been able to achieve?
even he would probably admit that 12 months ago a run of this magnitude was not really on the horizon.
you talked about not playing a style that everybody else plays. is that something you've been able to hone over the past couple of months? is that something you've always wanted to play, given that you don't have the one weapon, you have to have something else?
is it probably the only way that you can beat djokovic right now?
this being your third consecutive final, did you feel any additional pressure or motivation coming into montral knowing you would have points to defend in cincinnati?
tsonga said the other night basically the tough part about these masters series and grand slams, when you have to play the top four in the quarters and semis, it allows you to be not too fresh when you move on. you haven't had to face any of the top-10 players going through this tournament. does that give you an advantage in comparison to some of the other finals you played?
everybody keeps repeating how fast the surface is here. would you like to see more of these surfaces around the circuit?
another thing that tipsarevic said is that your return has improved tremendously. have you done anything in particular to improve your serve or is that the evolution of your game?
given the course of your career, how it's gone, how you're playing the best tennis of your life right now, 29 years old, do you feel an urgency to get as much done as you can as fast as you can?
you were saying that the surface right now here in montral is quicker than wimbledon.
even with the balls?
it's unprecedented to win five, much less five in a row. how special would that be?
are you surprised at just how much success, the sustained level you're able to produce at the moment? does it come as a surprise to you?
coming into the match, did you know that tsonga was hurting with his body?
do you feel you're going into the us open as the favorite, as the guy to beat?
can you comment on the way your opponent was playing before he got hurt?
monfils described his last match with you with very wide eyes as 'push, push, push, boom' against you. mardy said he's expecting more 'bang, bang, bang' at the net. what are you expecting tomorrow, some 'push, boom' or 'bang, bang'?
last time you played him in miami in the semis, you beat him 6-3, 6-1, an easy win. do you expect this one to be tougher tomorrow?
what was the most difficult moment for you in this match?
we understand this win puts you in the top 20. what does it mean to achieve that in your career?
you'll be facing mardy fish in the semis. you lost your last three matches against him. do you have something special in mind for him?
since last year you changed a lot as a player. you became better, more focused, more determined. also your game changed a lot. what is it you had to do to achieve that?
any chance to see you in the finals?
does it help you the fact that the no.1 player in the world is from serbia?
does that create any rivalry between yourself and the other serbian players?
do you feel you're gaining a lot of friends in montral?
do you feel this afternoon you're starting to gain some friends?
what is the last book that you read and how has it helped your game?
were you out there a little longer than you expected to be this day?
were you a little disappointed that you had to stay out there that long?
what sort of has been your key to success so far this summer on hard courts?
mardy, considering your success, are you maybe sorry you left it a bit late to come and play in canada?
just a few words on how did your life and your fitness change since your operation two years ago.
if you win the tournament like you did a few weeks ago, do you still allow yourself that you can eat fast food or not?
what is the favorite food you had to forego?
i remember in miami when you first overtook andy to become the no.1 ranked american, you were still saying, yeah, it's a bit of a fluke, with everything that andy has done, he's still the no.1 american. now we are here five months later. the opposition has consolidated. you're probably going to be in the top 8 seeds in the us open. has it changed the way you basically see things?
you're going to go into the us open as the leading american.
i was trying to understand. has it changed something in the way you behave?
other than the loss of weight and the better fitness, is there something else that has made the difference in your success?
and do you appreciate the success even more when you're older and after all you went through?
(question regarding his weight.)
and now?
this morning?
you seemed to have trouble with this player. what was it today? what was the difference?
than past games.
talk a bit about what your strategy was, your game plan, and if you felt you executed on it.
always smiling.
can you tell us what you feel today. it was a tough match at the start, and after you kept going.
i read a very interesting piece in sports illustrated. serbia's ambassador to the united states was quoted as saying you were the single biggest pr for serbia in the recent history of the country. that is a big compliment. what do you make of this comment and how do you feel about that?
regarding the olympics next year, what does it mean to you personally to be in the olympics and possibly win a gold medal in the olympics?
a question about the state of the men's game. i'm 55 years old. when i was playing tennis, when somebody the size of cilic played, he would serve and volley all the time. a player of that size would try to serve and volley, mix it up. now he is on the baseline. anderson is on the baseline. i know the game has changed and evolved. but as someone who plays a baseline game, when you see these huge guys, they don't move in, what is your impression of that?
i understand that.
as you said, serbia is a small country, but you have three players in the top 25. the three of you were playing today in montral. how do you explain serbia's success?
playing on the hard court, nadal was talking about it yesterday, he didn't really have a chance to play on it enough. we've seen a couple of top seeds go at this tournament, and even at the women's tournament. how important is it to get in that time on the hard courts before coming here?
novak, there are two matches today involving a serbian and a croatian. you won the first one. janko is leading in the second set. how special is this for you guys? is there some sort of rivalry between croatian and serbian players?
on the court after the matches you've been saying how the montral crowd is knowledgeable. what are your overall impressions of the canadian crowds?
murray and nadal are already out. are you surprised by that?
you were speaking a little bit earlier about the support of your family. can you talk about your company, what you want to accomplish with that?
your first win against federer in your career was here two years ago. how important a match was that for you? is he not as intimidating as he once was now that you've beaten him a couple of times?
do you prefer to play him in a best-of-five set match or best-of-three when you're up against a player of his caliber?
apart from a tough moment at 5-4, you played a more complete match than yesterday.
how is your ear?
in the two tiebreakers you only lost two points. does this mean that you are very solid?
i saw you twice chip and charge. this is typical from an attacking game. is this what you want to do now?
next will be federer. what are your feelings about that?
here you're playing on hard courts. it's different. do you have to change tactics?
he's 30. he's old.
did your victory in wimbledon change something for you more than any other victories?
your former match against him, is it going to be useful for playing this one?
you beat nadal in 2008 in the australian open. what is the difference between those two big wins?
what was your plan going in? how did you execute that?
a couple times in the first set, you were down love-30 on your serve. you were able to bounce back. were you surprised by that?
what surprised you or struck you the most about his game?
after the match in here federer said great things about you, thinks you have an uprising career. what does that mean to you to hear that?
what did you say to each other at the end of the match? any words he gave you there?
we talked about your composure, how you were able to regain it. you may have lost it a couple of times. on the outside it looked like you were calm most of the time. what were you really feeling?
yesterday you showed a real good touch at the net. tougher to get to the net against roger?
two crucial points where you tried the dropshot.
yes. hit the net.
one was a game point. just wondering whether you want those back?
what do you need to improve to get to the next level?
do you change anything when you're playing a top-20 player or top-10 player? do you change your serve?
where do you go next after this?
how was it on the court? exactly as you dreamt it?
he said you were very calm on the court. he said he was impressed by you. how does it feel to hear that?
was the turning point of that match when you were up 40-love on your serve and you lost that point? was it the key? you seemed frustrated.
how was this experience for you?
how did you manage the stress on court?
how did it feel on center court with all the crowd cheering for you?
i was with you in washington, saw what you had to go through last weekend. watching you today, couldn't quite tell if you were still a little tired from the legg mason or if you were conserving energy for later in the tournament. how do you feel physically and have you recovered from that long weekend in d.c.?
can you talk about switching from washington to here. is it different, although it's raining in both places?
how about your legs?
you play singles and doubles. do you need matches?
you just dropped five games per match. that's the rate.
so what about your game?
what about almagro for your next match?
did you play him already?
are you going to ask your doubles partner how to play him?
you beat bellucci easier than in the past today.
physically you seem to be well, too.
yesterday in this room, pospisil said he grew up idolizing you. how often does it happen now that the player across the net says something like that? is it something that took some getting used to?
when you're playing a player who said he looks up to you in that way, i think it was 5-all, he tried to hit a dropshot, it went straight into the net, then he self-destructed. when you're playing a player like that, are you sitting back expecting that moment to happen?
roger, pospisil talked yesterday of having hit against you once as a junior, the connection through his coach. was this more than just playing another young underdog? did you say any words of encouragement to him before or after the match?
roger, with the integration of the two tournaments, you saw the crowd there today obviously behind him, but the integration of the tournaments together the same week, is it something you're pro, con?
so it's your first match since you turned 30. how did it feel?
your next match will be against tsonga. last time you played him in your backyard, wimbledon.
what can you say about your opponent today?
jo is an aggressive player. this is also your type of game. how will that match be?
so is it going to be the same match here?
during grand slams you travel with many people. what are the good things and the bad things about that?
do you remember last time you traveled alone, completely alone?
your opponent today said you were his idol since he was a kid. how does it feel?
there was wind up in the stands. how did it feel down on the court?
at 1-all you talked with the umpire. what was it about?
he sliced all the time. did it have something to do with the loss?
when was the last time you hurt your neck?
and there's nothing to do about all these pains?
are you going to stay a bit longer here or are you going to cincinnati immediately?
was it real pain or was it fear of feeling pain?
you usually play doubles with gal. why are you playing with richard here?
(no microphone.)
can i ask you what your earliest memories of roger federer are?
you were on the court against nadal and djokovic last year in a doubles match. you have been on the court with world-class players. will that help settle your nerves or is federer just still tough?
at the beginning of the season your goal was to hit the top 200. i assume you revised your goals since then. was there any turning point in this season, anytime you felt that things were going to go really well for you?
what did you feel was the turning point in the match today?
that included starting to use the slice backhand?
a trivia question regarding federer. do you know how many slams he's won?
do you think it's going to be hard?
your coach knows him well?
have you ever met him?
one technical point about the match. what you were thinking when you got called for a foot-fault in the deciding game?
i was going to ask you about the cramping that seemed to be bothering you.
left thigh or in the calf?
what about his serve? you seemed to be having trouble with it in the first set.
between stretching out your leg for the cramps and trying to finish that match, were you able to enjoy how much you had the crowd with you?
is this the kind of match that a couple years ago when things got tough physically that maybe you would have not hung in there as well as you did today?
chela is ranked top 30 in the world right now. how would you compare his game versus some of the lower-ranked players you see on the challenger tour on a regular basis?
what was the one thing that struck you most about roger in australia?
did you have any family or friends in the crowd today?
what have you learned from playing against some of the more veteran players on tour now?
on your confidence point, when you're in a tough third set like that, is there anything specific you're drawing on, your davis cup experience, your run in vancouver?
when you talk about your goals changing, part of that means that your schedule changes as you move up the rankings. something like the us open, will that be on your radar screen after this is done?
but with more confidence than you might have had perhaps a little while back, having registered a win like this one?
with respect to looking ahead to the draw, knowing that federer was there, did that creep into the back of your mind?
you grew up with federer as your idol. why federer more than nadal? how many masters 1000s has nadal won?
good. but why federer?
you have a lipstick mark on your cheek. who was she and what did she say?
what does a win like this mean for you?
what do you have to say about your next match against federer?
your coach already brought good players to a very high level. what does he bring to you?
was it the 'real andy' today on the court?
what have your preparations been since playing davis cup after wimbledon? how have you prepared for the latter part of the hard court swing?
do you stick around now and practice here?
about the strategy, you're one of the best on the tour when you're playing defensively. when somebody goes to the net, you're going to pass. what was different today that you just couldn't do what you used to do?
maybe outside of tennis, there were new riots in england today.
what's your opinion?
you've spoken a lot about your diet and fitness coming into this tournament. is it a bit mystifying as to why you didn't feel good physically given you've been in such good shape in the buildup?
you mentioned you're playing doubles with your brother. you've obviously got cincinnati next week. there's plenty of time to rectify things for flushing meadows.
do you think you overdid it in miami? you put yourself through the paces out there in extreme heat, made it as hard as you could physically for yourself. do you think you overcooked it a little?
you were expecting to play tomorrow originally?
this is not the ideal moment to ask the question, but what is the advantage and disadvantage of traveling with a big entourage?
could you imagine traveling by yourself?
you said you were supposed to play tomorrow. was that something you were disappointed by the tournament that they changed that or it's normal?
you mentioned playing doubles with jamie. what difference does it make to play with him compared to playing with someone else?
in some respect, also more pressure for you when you play with him?
what sort of impressed you today about anderson? do you think he can go far in this tournament?
one of the biggest wins of your career?
anything different that you tried to beat such a top-level player?
what do you think they'll make of the match in your homeland?
what time is it there?
knowing that andy murray is so good on hard court, how would you measure yourself compared to him?
was the weather a factor today at all?
did you find the balls getting heavy at all?
where were your parents and family watching the match?
one of the things fans wonder about, even when you played a guy like that before, once the match starts, does the name factor go away?
the fact you've been playing a couple weeks on this surface, had a match yesterday, do you think that was a bit of an advantage for you?
talk a little bit about winning in johannesburg this year. is this what you were hoping for, a breakout season for yourself?
going back to murray. how surprised were you with how he played today?
how encouraged are you by that performance tonight. you served almost 70% of your first serves.
does the fact you've played here before, the year you made the final, went on to win the us open, is there a comfort zone preparing for the final grand slam?
you seemed to take over in the second set. at what point did you really feel like you had him?
you're in the same quarter at novak. is that something you would look forward to eventually facing off against him here? how important would it be to put in a good performance there and win, knowing the us open is around the corner?
what do you think has been the hardest part about coming back after the surgery?
a good effort today. career high 290 this morning. three sets with a top-25 player. validate your decision to get back out there?
your serve got you out of trouble a lot of times there. the spin backhand, the slice backhand, did that bother you at all?
what impressed you the most about him?
what kind of battles did you have to fight with yourself to get back into the second and third sets?
you said you found the inspiration. what made you want to come back into tennis?
what does this kind of a match do for you in terms of your confidence moving forward at this level?
so what are your plans for the next couple months when it comes to tennis?
what was the best-ranked player you played before this one?
you decided to go to university, but two weeks later you came back to tennis. can you tell us about that.
so you found your inspiration to play tennis again. why did you decide to come back?
how can you describe your day today?
what is the main difference between the challengers you usually play and this tournament?
what is your main goal in the long-term?
it was a nice match, but you didn't put enough first serves in the court to win this match, i suppose.
i want to know whether you think andy has a realistic shot of becoming world no.1 in the near future?
this is a match between no.4 and no.5. can you tell us how big the gap is between the top 4 and the others?
who do you think is the best player on court right now? is it murray? is it djokovic? is it federer?
it's the first time that roger is now out of the top 3 in eight years. do you think that's a significant development? do you think roger has a lot to do?
what makes andy difficult to play against? what does he do well?
what is the most difficult to handle in the game of andy murray?
it was your first semifinal in a masters event. we might be tempted to think that the occasion was too much for you. were you nervous out there today?
talk to us about your tournament overall. you're going to move up to around 32 in the world. you must see this as a big step forward for you.
at some point in the second set, a trainer came in. what made you decide not to have the medical timeout?
yesterday there were some questions about your fame and fanfare in japan. yesterday i walked outside and i saw some lady crying, she was so excited that you won. how does it feel to know you have the power to make somebody literally break down in tears?
can you tell us what is the biggest difference between you and andy murray? is it the serve, the return, power?
would it have made a difference if you had been always practicing in japan rather than the u.s.?
after the first match with murray, are you getting more confidence or do you find something you need to improve or you find a player like murray is really hard to beat?
if you win tomorrow, you'll go above federer in the rankings to no.3. i know you have a career winning record against federer, but what would that mean to you?
what especially pleased you tonight?
how tough an opponent could david ferrer be?
you do so much work on your serve in practice. there must be days when you're frustrated when it doesn't go in. does that make nights like tonight particularly satisfying?
what did you specifically do well against him last week? given the conditions and the balls are different here, will that mean a major tactical change or much more of the same?
how are you feeling psychologically? are you quite confident you can continue your form?
rumors that djokovic is going to have his wedding very soon and named you as the best man of his wedding.
that's not true?
last week in beijing some players pointed out the number of the audience inside the court is not that big, not too many people, even for the finals. are you satisfied with what the court looked like today in shanghai?
because the people inside the court is not that many.
are you satisfied with today's audience?
once again you seemed to rise to the occasion in the difficult moments. tell us how you managed to do that yet again.
it looked to me as you were looking to attack from early on. came down to a battle between your forehand and his slice backhand.
you still have one match left to win. what would it mean to you to win your first masters title here this week?
if you end up playing andy murray in the final, talk to us a little bit about your previous two matches with him. you lost in tokyo recently. andy is playing very well. how would you beat him?
before this match feliciano had a 6-1 hard court head-to-head advantage on you. what did you learn from the previous battles that attributed to this victory?
you used the challenge opportunity a lot. are you used to doing that or...
the improvement on your serve, did you change anything in your movement or something like that?
what do you know or think about kei, andy's opponent this afternoon?
how do you think you played today?
and you?
can you talk a little bit about the first game in the third set when you had three break chances.
looking at the week as a whole, how do you look at how you leave shanghai compared to how you arrived?
what is your program for the rest of the season?
rafael nadal said something about a special tax regime in uk tournaments yesterday. what is your feeling about that issue?
there was an official comment from the atp yesterday saying that the players, the organizers, should all go into a room and not come out until certain issues have been resolved. do you think that would be a good strategy?
kei, an important milestone in your career, to reach your first semifinal. is it extra special to do it in asia?
today maybe your easiest win of the week. can you explain why?
can you talk a little bit about what this year has meant to you overall. obviously you're having your best season, reaching the top ranking for a japanese player.
i overheard that your mother is a little bit worry about your possible next-round opponent, andy murray. do you share the same feeling? and if you have any tactic?
is there anything serious with your ankle injury?
i heard you were a roommate of the son of brad gilbert. now gilbert is your coach. could you say something about him.
i remember when you cracked the top 100 in 2008, you became suddenly a big star in japan. are you still a star in japan?
but are you still a star in japan?
do you think for asian players, if you want to be a top player, training in europe or america is the only way?
can you give us an idea of the status of tennis in japan. how popular is the game compared to other sports in japan?
you seemed today to be very comfortable at the net. is that something that brad perhaps has told you to be a little bit more aggressive, bring a little bit more variety into your game?
when brad coached andy murray, he often alluded to his time with andre agassi and andy roddick and used to say to murray, you should do that like agassi used to, or, you should do that like roddick used to. does he ever say to you, you should do that like murray?
it's been a good year for asian tennis, li na and now you. do you feel that sense of responsibility as well, that you're flying the flag for east asia?
if you do meet andy in the semifinals, talk to us a little bit about what his best strengths are and how you might find a way to beat him.
is there anything written on your headband?
what was your verdict on the match, andy?
does knowing you're a hot favorite for the title now put extra pressure on you? you seem to have another gear to go into. can you tell us about that.
your next opponent is nishikori, the first asian player to reach a masters semifinal. any impression about him?
is he one of those players who could be a star of next season looking forward?
you're on quite a streak. there was an item on sky news that you haven't lost since you started tweeting. is there any correlation between the two?
there's a certain gentleman probably sitting beside a telephone in northern california who will be offering kei advice. what do you think he'll be telling him?
because you've become so used to still being at the back end of tournaments this year with novak and rafa and roger, is it slightly an odd feeling, you and three others?
please comment on your match today. next match you will play with your countryman.
you said that florian mayer plays in a strange way.
how does today's match feel compared with yesterday when you were fighting off the match points against ferrero? today did you feel stronger out there? did you feel like you played better?
you looked very strong at key moments and your serving was good. that must give you confidence for the rest of the tournament.
you had the first match point on his serve. what were you thinking then?
did you ever imagine you can step so far into the semifinals before the tournament? how is your preparation for the next game?
it's the first time you make the quarterfinals in an atp 1000 tournament. what makes you get this breakthrough?
yes.
many people think asian men are not strong enough to survive on the top of men's tennis, but you did well. can you tell us how tough was it to compete with the usually taller and stronger players than you, especially the powerful player like tsonga?
as an asian player, could you give suggestion or advice to our chinese young men players?
all three wins you got this week were in three sets. you always come back. shows you're a mentally very strong player. are you naturally born that way, a strong boy, or is that the way japanese people are?
we know you were troubled by some injuries a couple years ago. the match against tsonga you also asked for several medical timeouts. do you think physical fitness is the biggest obstacle for asian players to play at this level?
so you found a solution about how to play without injury?
it was just mentioned you will get your best ranking for japanese players. what is your goal in your career in ranking, top 10 or top 20?
japanese football is getting better and better because you have a training program when people are young. does japan have a similar training program for young tennis players? are you a product of that, if there is?
you mentioned the injury you had a few years ago. when i talked to a japanese journalist at the us open, she said you are obviously a very talented player, but the injury you had let you miss a golden time in your career. you are already 21 or 22. when you were 19, you showed a lot of talent. even rafael nadal said you could be a top 10 player one day.
florian is a very unorthodox player. did you find that part of his game tough tonight? he's not like most players.
could you compare with the loss of last year at the same stage of the tournament or is it quite different?
yes.
before next season you still have three pretty big events this season. you're not going to play anything between now and paris? paris, london, seville?
a question about next year's schedule. can you tell us about your reasons for not playing at queen's next year and how much of this has to do with the uk tax law, the amount of money you stand to lose from your endorsements?
back to tonight's match. obviously you were so sharp yesterday, it might be a bit early, but is there a moment you can pinpoint where your game wasn't right?
back on the tax question in the uk. the world tour finals are in london for two more years. after that, do you think the top players will maybe think they will not want to do another deal for london because of the tax situation?
i want to hear what you think.
yesterday you complained about the ball. how do you feel tonight? the same feeling as yesterday?
it was a tough match. you knew it was going to be a tough match. what did you have to do to win it?
what do you know about your next opponent? not too many of us know much about him.
stan smashed his racquet twice. do you have this kind of moment where you want to do a similar thing in your career?
how are you doing energy-wise? a long trip for you; lots of matches.
you played three different asian tournaments in three different countries. can you talk about why you played in tokyo instead of beijing? will you play in tokyo again next year because you have to defend the title?
one of the things that i certainly didn't know about your next opponent until i was told a few minutes ago is that he often fills in his time by writing poetry. have you ever felt the need to exercise your muse?
which poets are big on your list then?
very impressive.
dragging you down from the lofty heights of kipling to balls.
given what you were saying yesterday, how did you find it tonight, particularly under the roof?
the balls.
i heard you singing before the press conference. what about singing?
maybe you can sing louder.
what kind of music do you like?
how sweet it is to beat nadal.
it seems as though you're probably enjoying as good a time in your career as you are at the moment. is there any particular reason for that do you think?
your style of play, similar to dolgopolov, slices and spins, suddenly it seems to be working against the best players in the world. it's a strategy i think that probably upsets them on the court. and you're serving very well, too.
did you get some tips from melzer, who beat nadal last year?
what role do you think the speed of the surface played in this win? it's rare on the circuit to have surfaces that fast. what do you think?
about the wimbledon quarterfinal, is it because you were too young? perhaps the german tennis writers were saying, here is the new sensation in the game?
talk about how important it is that you've made the finals.
can you talk about the second set, saving the three match points. what was going through your mind?
now that you've qualified for the world tour finals, can you set your mind on what you might be planning for next year, 2012, particularly plans to defend your title in auckland?
andy tomorrow. obviously visions of time in austin. you did really well there. can you talk a little bit about that.
i want to ask you a little bit about rafael nadal. you're friends. you've watched him through the years. how has he changed since he first came on the tour to you? how do you think he feels about this year?
you beat andy here in 2008 at the masters cup. do you think the courts here suit you compared to flushing meadows?
by how far is that your best career win?
five set points. were you starting to get the wobbles?
why now in your career, do you think?
you are very calm on the court. do you work on that?
this being a masters event, the superstars come thick and fast. after simon today, murray tomorrow. what do you make of that matchup?
you've come up playing the challengers, futures tours. can you give us an idea of some of the more obscure places you've played quite recently?
not so long ago if you hadn't made it in your teens, it was almost like you're finished. now that's sort of reversed itself. have you given much thought as to why that is? you're not the only guy who is enjoying the best years at your sort of age.
i know it's not over yet, but you've guaranteed yourself 80 grand for this. have you thought about the money at all?
correct me if i'm wrong, but almost a year ago to the week you were playing in scotland, weren't you?
what sort of hotel were you staying in? where were you eating at night?
in glasgow?
there is one then.
quite ironic, though, isn't it?
what was it like playing on that court? indoor courts, nobody there, no applause. must have been a bit weird.
did you feel maybe in the first set you were playing a little bit of his game? what did you do to change it in the second and third set?
are you surprised how quickly those last two sets went?
your first masters quarterfinal. great opportunity to reach the semis.
you were playing well the last two sets. were you surprised at his reaction at the end?
he said that he's 18 years old. his plan still is to be no.1 by 2021, that he thinks it's possible. what's your plan?
you didn't seem to have a whole lot of energy in the beginning of the match, the first set. how were you feeling out there today? how do you think it went overall?
he can be a very clever player. a lot of people have been talking about him for a long time. how talented is he?
you have several points advantage over nicolas almagro in terms of the race towards the world tour finals in london. despite this result, are you still confident you can get there?
i'm assuming you're playing bercy. where else are you playing before then?
it was a good revenge from last year in bangkok, i suppose?
can you tell us a bit more about the differences between the balls, how it affects the way you have to adjust.
andy was saying the same thing yesterday. have you two been having a chat? what do you want to see done? he wants the balls standardized.
same was the case on the clay, wasn't it? they changed going into roland garros, madrid and rome changed to get in line with roland garros.
you know why it is, though? because of the commercial deals that each tournament can make for itself. so do you think this is a problem that is an indication of everything that you're talking about?
as we just heard, andy has similar feelings about this as you've just been explaining. what about the other players? is there a strong feeling?
can i ask you about something in your book. when you talked about novak djokovic, you said three or four years ago when you were asked: there's you and there's federer, who will be the next player who might challenge you? you said straightaway djokovic. what was it that you saw in djokovic then that made you think he would be the player to challenge you and roger?
is your book selling well? do you know?
you just said thank you in chinese. i would like to know how many times you have practiced chinese? would you like to know a little bit more chinese?
can i ask you about something other than tennis. did you manage to get to see spain's win over scotland in the european championship? if so, did you remind andy murray of the result?
that was a hard-fought one out there.
looked like he was pushing you a fair way back there. looked a little frustrated at times.
top 50 today for the first time. what is your reaction to that?
how far have you exceeded your expectations? you said at the australian open top 100 would have been a good result.
that's got to be a great thing for you. up in the top 50 now, you should get into masters series tournaments regularly.
ultimately, where do you see your favorite surface? where do you think you'll have the most success?
you're based back on the gold coast now, is that right?
you talked before about possibly having a base in europe or in the states. have you thought about that anymore?
so you'll be there throughout the summer, monte-carlo?
aren't you there already or just sort of part-time? what's changing?
did you try out a time at bollettieri's last year?
so clearly the season is nearly done. what are your plans over the off-season this year? are you changing anything, doing anything more or less?
is this your last tournament for the season?
do you think you can get to top 30?
you've had a few not-so-great experiences here. i presume today it was a bit nervy, but you got the job done.
you met lu in 2010 and lost. what have you done differently this time?
mentally?
i wanted to get your views on the no-shows for djokovic and federer this week, whether it backs up fears of the season being too long.
there was a lot of talk at the us open about the players meeting here to discuss those sort of issues. is that still going to happen?
but do you think, though, that the absence of guys like novak and roger might mean that you can't really come to any major decisions?
do you feel like the situation has maybe lost a little momentum after the us open? it's been a few weeks now. or are the players still as fired up as they were at that time?
beyond the scheduling, what are some of the other things you want to fix or see changed?
presumably there are plenty of players around who like the fact that there are loads of tournaments available to play. do you sense there's going to be an argument within the locker room?
that's presumably a harder battle to win, though, isn't it?
in any successful union or negotiation, you have to have solid support.
you all have different perspectives on life and a different status in the game.
can you give a little bit of a how you view this year.
do you think it makes it a little harder or actually easier to look forward to 2012, just start fresh again?
you skipped the beijing olympics. are you hoping to play in london this year?
is that important?
how do you take today's performance compared with your performance in beijing two days ago? has there been any improvement?
all the other chinese players have lost. compared with your compatriots, what do you think you were missing against verdasco?
what do you think verdasco's weaknesses and strengths are? how did you deal with these?
the top players, they're stronger and faster. what do you think of their total performance, their rhythm, the control they have over the pace?
what is your mix of training and competition?
i noticed you were breathing heavily and deeply at the very beginning. do you feel nervous at all? when did you feel more relaxed?
in beijing you played in doubles. i would like to ask if you're playing better in doubles now.
after this tournament, you will enter into an off period, is that so?
since you are relatively on a lower level, it doesn't mean you are on a less intensive pace exactly. does that exhaust you?
do you think you can totally recover from that? does that mean you have never fully recuperated?
we have interviewed a number of chinese coaches and they have commented on some chinese players. they think chinese players are milder. they behave, so to speak. does it mean it will lower down your aggressiveness when you're on the court? as a chinese player, what is your take on that?
do you think you could learn from their personalities?
you said you felt the gap between you and top-seeded players. we have talked about the gaps a lot. do you have some methods or ways to catch up? do you think intensive competition can help?
what is your take of this competition? since you have taken on a french coach, any changes?
is it because of a lot of comments from your french coach that you worked on the previous strategy?
donald young is a young players from the united states. our chinese players are older or his same age. when you are competing with a younger player from a more advanced country, do you still feel a gap?
you talk about getting involved in this community. do you think getting involved in this community is the only way forward?
take yourself as an example. what is the mix of your international and domestic competitions?
do you find any obstacles in going abroad?
do you think american or european games are more beneficial?
from a longer perspective, if you opt for more european competitions and matches, will you get more benefit? but if you have to do that, you will have to do that after the olympics of 2012, is that true?
from a london olympics perspective, you and li are partners. have you been designated as the olympic team? has the national team made any decision with regard to the designated olympic pairs?
li zhe said the tennis environment isn't ideal. do you have any regrets about china's tennis culture? he thought of himself as a foreigner and a previous generation and would like to contribute to later generations. what is your take on that?
tough day for you. what do you think the turning point was in the match today?
a that what a impressing you most about novak, a his mental strength? he might not have had it a few years ago but it's there now.
looked near the end that he might be getting tired and he was looking at his box. looked like he was ready to maybe go down a little bit, but he seemed to play very strong at the end. were you surprised with that?
you seemed to have a lot of double faults today.
six or seven. six.
what do you think a the reason that you weren't serving as well?
which was the harder match, last week or this?
how far are you...
how far are you from where you want to be? i know you had a month that you couldn't practice or anything.
do you feel like he's breathing down your neck to be no.1?
did you feel like in the clay court season you can separate like you have in the past?
at the end of the first set, at 5-2 when you came up to serve for the set, you went for the ice scarf. you used it, and at the end you were bending over. were you feeling as if were going to pass out? have you had any type of treatment since the end of the match?
i was in the shade.
this time last year when you were sitting there having not won this tournament, you then won monte-carlo, madrid, rome, paris, wimbledon. so you must take some comfort in that. your favorite surface is about to happen.
that was part of my question, too. you've been to the finals here a few times. how tough it was to lose this match today?
well-played, rafa. even if he had taken that breakpoint at the start of the second set, did you still feel that you were in control of this match all the time?
did you feel immediately well on the court from the first point?
do you sense that he became discouraged pretty early in the match? did you have any feeling about that looking across the net or the vibes you were getting?
talk about novak.
do you like this court better, the speed?
we saw a couple years ago at wimbledon you had the bandages on the knees. you look healthy now and very fast on the court. what's the key for your fitness as far as getting rid of the knee problems?
can you remember anything of your 2004 match against roger here? you beat him 6-3, 6-3; you were 18. can you remember anything about that?
17, okay.
yesterday you had a shoulder issue. is that resolved, because you served really well tonight?
you had a shoulder problem against berdych.
just in general is it okay?
obviously i know you're disappointed. just seems like he's playing so great right now. you have to be almost perfect to beat him. talk about the key breakpoints in the first set, 15-40, swing volley.
do you feel like the rain might have stalled you a little bit? you seemed to be even with him.
at one point you shook your head. you had two amazing inside out forehands to his backhand and he got them back.
you talk about he's moving better than anyone. in february in dubai, feliciano lopez said he's the fastest mover in men's tennis, quicker than nadal and murray.
how amazing is it? are guys in the locker room talking? i mean, here it is april 1st and he hasn't lost a match. he hasn't even lost a game.
how would you scout tonight's match, and what do you think? can someone beat novak on sunday do you think?
what do you take from this tournament? obviously didn't go your way today unfortunately, but obviously you're the highest-ranking american...
where will you start your clay court season?
are you going to try harder than the previous years in clay court because of the rankings, you want to be top 10?
you often credited your wife for getting you on a new diet. i was looking for research on you, and i know that a couple years ago when you got married you were in this jewish ceremony and you broke the wine glass. were you thinking of converting to judaism or raising your children as jews?
how did you hurt your neck?
right when you woke up this morning did you feel it and did you think, oh, now i might not be able to play?
must be so disappointing coming back from the two knee surgeries, playing really well, and you've done well against roger in the past. must be bummed.
was it frustrating to hear the crowd's reaction when you walked of the court? wish you could grab a microphone and explain how badly you felt?
where is it? neck or back?
so you can't move your head which way?
just during warmups hitting a forehand?
during warmups you were hitting and it just happened?
did you do any tests the last time it happened to you to try to find out what it is?
anyone tell you you should try yoga?
who's your favorite player to win this tournament?
gilles has been tough with you in the last few years. a nice way to get into the semis?
he said he injured it in the warmups. did you feel this?
his in the morning.
how did you get rid of the energy that you have? in the beginning you're fired up to go out and play, and all of a sudden it just dissipates.
before you go out you're pretty excited.
is there something you do tonight that you wouldn't normally have done?
yes.
i just meant do you think you'll go to coconut grove?
i think all the fans are rooting for you to play a certain player friday night in the semis. how do you feel about playing rafa possibly?
would you believe it's been six years since you played in the united states?
here, the final.
it's a quirky thing, but it's really hard to believe.
can you talk a little bit more about that fine line that athletes walk between staying healthy and having to deal with injuries?
you've been able to stay relatively healthy. any keys to that? is it luck?
i know you're downplaying a little bit playing rafa. isn't he still the barometer with which you maybe measure your game as far as who is the best in the world?
what memories you have about this tournament? seven years ago it was the first time that nadal play against you. you think that he will be extra motivated?
it happens in tennis sometimes when rivalry becomes a trivalry. there was connors and borg, and then mcenroe shows up. in the last half year it's federer, nadal, and djokovic. have you only felt it in a real sense that it's happened like maybe since last fall?
do you think we put too much emphasis on the rivalry when we have so many other players? do you have a sense of, well, let them go write about something else or give those guys enough credit?
yeah.
with rivalries you're usually not supposed to like the guy until after one of you retires.
when you trash talk andy roddick, how does it go?
so this subject is off limits between you two?
is there a part of you that kind of says, gee, maybe i'm sorry i didn't work this hard a bunch of years ago, what i might have missed, or you can't look back?
did you suspect david was ailing in any way? didn't seem like his usual self out there.
do you watch old videos or whatever, tapes of yourself as a player? can you just talk about how you looked as a player then and what you're doing now?
even your style of play, forgetting about the physical...
during the match, were you at all thinking about this no.11 situation? if so, how much of it were you able to put out of your mind?
did you receive any messages from your fellow american colleagues?
i know it's tough to comment or analyze another guy's game, but this guy has been really consistent and his ranking is way up there in the top 10.
yeah. but he seems to have trouble punching through it even at masters series level.
in the second set he's obviously struggling and the match is getting away from him. when he lobs the ball at the crying baby, what was your reaction?
he didn't hit it that hard.
i want to ask about the potential of djokovic, if you were to play him. talk about what he's doing this year.
speaking of serving, have you ever felt more confident on your serve, first or second?
you're mixing it up real well. you're hitting an ace and you look at the clock and you see that it's nowhere near the max service speed. is it your spin? is it your placement?
obviously no.11, you're flirting with top 10. is that a goal for you?
i want to ask on the off chance that kevin anderson were to win...
yeah, and no one is talking about him. talk about kevin.
what triggers the decision to serve and volley suddenly? is it the score? the moment?
on the points of confidence and motivation, what you've achieved over here, how much more confidence and motivation do you think it's going to provide you with?
going back to djokovic for one second, you said at the moment he has no weaknesses. one of them has that he doesn't perform that well in heat. you said you grew up playing in this kind of climate. do you think that could be a weakness now?
i know that you grew up around vero and all that. what are your south florida ties now?
would you rather play in the heat?
you requested day matches for the whole tournament?
your dad's one of the few parents who have qualified to be like a coach or mentor, be hands-on, yet they've always seemed to take a -- he and your mom -- a back seat.
sergio garcia a new buddy?
have you golfed with him?
my question is about djokovic on clay. you are playing good tennis on clay. do you think djokovic can win roland garros and play very well on clay this year?
could you comment on mardy's game? he seemed to be serving very well today and playing well off the ground. did he play better than you expected maybe?
because of why, physical problems?
is that a pulled muscle or like a sickness?
something you ate you think or you got a bug?
the crying baby, was it kind of like the last straw? obviously things weren't going well for you.
you tried to clock him with the ball.
you weren't fit today obviously, but beyond that, you work so hard. you've had such a good, consistent record, yet you have a little bit of a trouble getting over the last stage at the masters and the grand slam level. why is it this?
what do you think of mardy's game at the ripe old age of 29?
do you think it's still possible for you to improve or to change some things, or are you a finished product at this point in your career?
if you look at the numbers, it sounds like an easy game, but didn't look an easy one.
but you looked very comfortable and you were enjoying the match. looked like you were having fun?
you play against a guy with a big serve. is there a special way to prepare for that kind of match?
can you tell me about your next opponent, what you think about?
your next opponent says that playing during the day and night in this tournament is two completely different tournaments.
you've played both during the day and night...
you had five breakpoints to save. you saved all of them. isn't it the best proof of your confidence and that your confidence is as high a possible?
that's 24 wins in a row going back to last year.
that must develop its own confidence.
you're the last american in the tournament, men and women. you may be the no.1 american at the end of this tournament. you're out there and it sounded like you were playing in south america. you're a native floridian. what did you make of it?
are you ready to wave the banner for the usa here the rest of the way?
how do you feel about the court speed here? roger federer last night compared it to a clay court. he said you can't slide. that's the only difference. isn't it strange that all these hard courts are playing so slow?
you had some pretty big games out there with break points. what was the key to getting through them? you had all those set points and break points.
you have been doing this for a dozen years. there's always been somebody over you.
pete, andre, andy, even james. i know you try not to think about it, but what would it be like to be the top player?
twelve months ago i remember you standing in this room with a bag of ice on your knee, and you were telling us how you lost so much weight. now, twelve months later you are on the verge of being the no.1 american. can you pinpoint a couple of things that actually led you to where you are now?
most guys on the tour are afraid to take a lot of time off. would that be a blessing, too, with the season being so long? is it nice to take a few months?
did you have some problems, physical problems, that kept you out of ecuador and the davis cup?
are you on certain medication for it, or is the thyroid, was it a temporary thing?
was that cramps at the end of the tiebreaker?
so you were not wanting to play a third set?
in terms of this makeover, mardy, do you feel a sense of urgency like you got to get it done because the clock is ticking, or is it more like a rediscovery of a way of life?
you have reflected a couple of times on your work ethic and being the true professional that you are now, and you see the results that the diet and other changes are having. do you ever reflect on what results you might attain, you might have attained, if you were 20 years old with this sort of outlook?
the other day del potro spoke of you almost like you were a friend. he said he liked you. could you just talk about what, if any, relationship you have with him.
could you talk about your next match against david ferrer.
we are from argentina. two questions: first, your opinion about juan martin's tennis level. the second one, he told us you are close friends. you have said something, but at the end of the match, you said something to him.
what was that?
he said that you have been with him when he was injured. can you comment?
i know you're not comfortable with the fact that you could be the leading american with andy's situation in mind. but on a personal level, at the ripe old age of 29, what does it mean to you going to what's going to be a career-high ranking?
what are your thoughts for the davis cup game against spain?
is the diet still as strict? are you...
what are some of the things, some of the cravings that you have?
or things you cheat...
what do you like on your pizza?
you think it's more difficult for you to play against good friends or does it make you more comfortable on court?
i can't imagine when you play davydenko, for instance, and you play feliciano, is it not different for your mind or...
what did you like about your play today? what would you like to improve on?
are you planning to play the upcoming davis cup tie in austin?
i was wondering what do you remember at this tournament in 2004 when you beat federer? it was a big upset at the time; you were 17. do you remember that match and do you remember what it meant to your career at that point in time?
can you talk about your position now, sort of as the dominant no.1 guy? you've got people now chasing you rather than you chasing them. how do you feel in that position of being no.1 and feeling that?
although monaco is a clay court specialist mostly, he really seemed to handle himself well on this surface today. what was tough for you today in terms of playing him?
what kind of things did you try? you're talking about things you could try, shots you could try?
does it make any difference to you at all playing as no.3 in this tournament?
you have never lost a match against olivier rochus. what's your opinion now on him?
same as you, he mentions his friendship since you were 12, i think.
does that make you give him consideration out on the court?
i'm from canada and we have a rising star. he was knocked out in the first round. milos raonic. have you seen his game? do you have an opinion on it?
i am working for spanish channel, and they want to know, how do you like miami?
you played twice in the daytime in the heat. would you describe what it does to your body and the impact?
i'm from mexico, robin. how do you feel about the tournament? i understand that it was a difficult match, and i would like to know your perception about playing the first match and having such a difficult match against del potro?
how is the situation, how is your perception coming into the clay season? how do you feel after a difficult two tournaments in the hard court season?
obviously juan martin, that's a tough floater third round; that should be a final. were you prepared for such a tough match so early in the tournament?
did he show you something today that you haven't seen from him since the wrist surgery? was this the old juan martin maybe from two years ago?
was the weather a factor for you today at all?
the weather?
the heat.
in february you played very solid, two tournament wins. i have the feeling players just tried everything against, but you just won all your matches. what's the difference now?
what was wrong? was it just technical or anything else bothering you?
things seem to be really going well. going through the draw nicely. you look solid out there. how do you feel?
is it under control, the thyroid condition?
so you've been both, hypo and hyper?
hyper, yeah.
so are you taking now synthroid?
so they got you to the even point?
did you do the radioactive iodine?
i found out by the end of this tournament, i think if you reach the semis, you could be the top-ranked american.
how special would that be?
with andy out, you are one of a handful. at the beginning of the day, there were five americans left, american man left in the tournament, and the top-ranked american man left in the tournament. does that affect the tournament at all for you? is there any more pressure?
how concerned are you for andy? have you talked since yesterday?
did you follow the davis cup while you were home?
are you hoping to be there in austin?
did you talk to the guys at all about jim?
the win today over gasquet gave you your second straight win after the frenchman after he won the first two meetings. what's been the key?
you have had your fair share of injuries and illnesses through your career, and you get fit and you're playing well and something else hits. can you explain how frustrating that gets? is it a case of, oh, not again, why me now once more?
del potro/soderling. wow. talk about how you're going to blunt some of that power.
tennis is an individual sport, other than let's say at the davis cup or olympics or something like that. do you feel in any way that you are representing your country, you know, or how much of that comes into play? they do always put american or whatever, u.s. ?
how did it feel to beat a top-10 player today?
you told us in delray that that's what you needed to do to really feel confident again, to beat a top-10 player. does this give you that confidence?
how did that last running forehand feel at the end of the first set? you seemed very happy.
after the first match, how do you feel about the physical condition? how's the body?
mardy fish, you played him in delray. i don't think he had a really good night that night, but you certainly played well.
talk about playing mardy again.
a lot of people thought you might not be ready to win a slam again until maybe the us open because of how serious the injury was. can you compete for the title at wimbledon in your mind the way things are going?
so you won't be convinced that you could be at the top again until you win what? this tournament? a slam?
are you contagious?
so what is it?
looked like you were limping. anything wrong with your foot?
when did it start bothering you?
breathing.
did you feel bad...
you're concerned obviously because of the mono last year?
did you have any indication though? you were coughing the other day and stuff like that. did you have any indication that you just weren't feeling well going into the match?
even so, did you feel like you had a chance to get into the match, or you just put in the time and were trying to put in a good effort?
you weren't moving on some those aces. was that your sickness or your injury?
was it both?
do you think way cuevas' play was good enough?
what hurt you most about his play?
if you weren't defending champ, you might have bagged it early, you think?
can you just tell us how you feel? i mean, just how bummed you are, how emotionally...
what's your schedule like coming up?
what's your next tournament?
you went to your doctors in texas after delray; did they tell you anything?
is it the same? does it feel the same as what you had just before delray?
thanks to greg sharko here, we know...
bottom of the first page, you have tied someone named pete sampras for career-match victories: 762.
i know you reach these milestones all the time. when a name like sampras is attached to it, does it make an impression on you?
you have about 500 wins to go to catch no.1, jimmy connors.
jimmy played until he was 38.
not a difficult match. radek is obviously a tough player to play because he's kind of old school.
are the courts playing slower than indian wells? seems like not a lot of winner, cold winners lately.
you have juan monaco next. can you talk about him and the matchup?
i know it's looking far ahead, but you are in the same half as nadal. is it strange to be penned against him possibly in the semifinal as opposed to a final?
your outfit today was a little different. it was not as colorful and no collar on the shirt. is that a new look?
as an athlete gets older, i'm wondering what your thoughts are, what maybe is the most difficult to maintain? concentration? nerve? actual athletic ability?
you still practice? you don't have to push yourself to go out and practice some days? you like to do it?
what about with the media? now that you have all the attention because you're not no.1 anymore, does it feel different?
how would you prefer to deal with the media?
would you consider that the most important victory of your career? do you think that you would have won if andy was healthy? do you feel that was a problem for him?
is it tough to play someone you know is injured, who is having a problem, breathing difficulties?
you will play against gilles simon. how do you think the match will go?
at what point did you know that he was not himself, hurt, sick, or whatever? when in the match?
is that the best you ever served?
is that kick serve that you made about six straight points on, is that your specialty?
are the courts slower than usual? do you notice an advantage maybe for the clay courters because the courts are slower?
how was your level of confidence, considering last week you lost kind of early at indian wells and after this tough victory today in miami?
novak was talking the other day about how confidence means everything. jim courier was saying the same thing last night. did you get your first burst of confidence at sunrise two years ago, the challenger?
kohlschreiber or del potro going forward. any preferences?
chris bosh came by the other night, basketball player, 6'10." seems like he fit in in the locker room. the players are getting taller and taller. do you feel like that's the way the game's going? i mean, little guys are getting squeezed out?
david ferrer...
if he was a little taller he would be a grand slam champ, right?
djokovic talked the other day about how confidence is everything in this sport. is it safe to say that's plaguing you right now, a confidence problem?
had you ever heard of him?
is everything okay? serves, 95, 110; is everything okay?
because you're a player for whom so much comes naturally, when it's not coming naturally it is almost doubly hard to concentrate, get yourself into it?
is it a question that just the whole sort of business of competing is difficult at the moment?
do you find competing difficult mentally?
you seemed obviously frustrated and increasingly angry at yourself. do the emotions hurt your game at all?
can you break out of this frustration?
yes.
do you believe in yourself enough?
getting out of it?
you have obviously had the experience last year of the australian open final and how much that took out of you emotionally as well as everything else. now you have the same experience in a sense. what do you take as a positive?
is it more difficult to leave last year because it's your second year in a row?
if you can compare.
can you talk about bogomolov did particularly well today?
people at home perhaps will ask, are you happy with your coaching situation? you look like a guy who needs some guidance to get out of this. you haven't won a set now in two months. i mean, are you looking possibly to get anybody else in or make any alterations to the people around you?
when was the last time you worked out at um?
what made you think you could do it?
what have you been doing well overall in the last few months?
is it the best win of your career? i know you beat haas years ago, but has this been the best win of your career for you?
what was the surgery and when?
what year was the surgery?
what have you been doing the last 50 minutes? make a phone call to anyone?
we saw you blow a kiss there. who was that to?
when did you move to the states?
to miami?
that's a lot of free burgers and shakes.
do you feel like then this is a homecoming for you?
here, you're talking about miami?
you may move to boca?
where's your family now?
your mom...
boris?
does he play at sunset now or...
how old is he?
he's 18. your son, his name?
how do you spell it?
how old is he? when was he born?
were you a sunset high champion?
how many...
when did you graduate high school?
'02?
first thing i want to ask, is your wife -- it's your wife?
is she a tennis player? what's her name?
what's her last name?
did you feel andy was confident?
you served for the match at 5-3. didn't make it. what did you do there? what are you telling yourself when your big chance seemed to have been blown?
had you ever faced andy before today?
do you remember the score of that match?
win or lost?
have you played isner before? what's it like playing these giants out there these days?
what's it like playing -- there are so many giants on the courts these days?
power?
so this magician fella finally fixed you up?
what was the key today in beating him?
what was the key in breaking his serve so many times?
how would you characterize your career, and do you feel at this point you can keep getting better?
when did you say you were going to come here to boca? you already know you're coming?
how has fatherhood changed you? has it?
has your father been your main coach over the years?
what was the name of the johnny rockets guy?
at your level, can you support a family?
are your parents together?
where is does your father live?
what's it about this tournament that allows you to play so well?
i know your illini lost on sunday night. does this one today take some of the sting off of sunday's loss?
i heard you have the best bracket out of everybody here.
who are the other three?
does your brother play tennis for morehead?
you have some good wins in your career, but beating davydenko is a solid effort.
were you able to pick up any tendencies? you know, you've played him once before. did that contribute -- even though you lost, did you still find some tendencies that you could use on court?
in the second set you were down two games to one. you double faulted twice. what was going through your head and how did you rebound?
what kind of mindset were you in after you were able to break the first game?
what are your thoughts on the next one?
do you think you would have been this kind of player if you had not played college tennis?
this is you, john, somdev?
you're playing the top tennis of your career right now. you won in south africa; you had a great run in spain. is there anything you credit your newfound success to? are you playing with more confidence? have you altered your mechanics at all or just a combination of everything?
did you have a chance to talk to davydenko after the match? because i know, you know, he's gone through tough times. he's trying to resurrect himself. at one point he was ranked 3 in the world. did you have a chance to give him any words of advice or talk to him at all?
at any time was fatigue a factor in the match today?
did it put you out of your rhythm at all, the long timeout he took after the first game of the fourth set?
did it knock you out of your rhythm when he took the long injury timeout after the first game of the fourth set after you had just won the tiebreak?
were you gaining some hope when you saw his back was hurting?
rafa, has novak djokovic taken tennis to an even higher level? please talk about this incredible year that he's had and what that means.
what made novak's return of serve so effective tonight? what was the mental challenge for you of facing break points so many times?
what did you like about the way you played tonight?
you were changing the pace, slicing the ball deep to him at the baseline. he made some unforced errors when you sliced the ball deep. were you sensing that?
seemed to be effective at times.
i thought so. as you point out, he's always had a great return and probably a great forehand. what do you think he's improved this year the most in his shots that has brought him to this level? serve or...
how do you look about grand slam result this year? are you satisfied?
yeah. you won roland garros but you could not win wimbledon and the us open.
that long game in the second set, i think game three, how deflating was that on your serve to not come out of that when you put the overhead in the net?
how does it feel to be going back to the final?
it's a repeat of last year's final. what similarities and differences do you think might be out there on monday versus last year?
did you watch his match against roger, or were you already focused?
what do you think of his game?
will you have a new strategy monday? how much are you looking forward to having tomorrow's day off that you really wanted?
what about the sunday off that you really, really seemed to want?
you have played andy many times. you know how good a player he is. he keeps getting so close and can't quite win one of these things. how dispirited would you be if you were getting so close but couldn't quite win a major title?
he'll take one. can you just talk about how novak's two-handed backhand comes back differently against your forehand as opposed to roger or someone with a one-handed backhand?
at the start of your book, you say the hardest thing you have to do on court is to keep your mind quiet, and that wimbledon is really hard because it's so silent there, so quiet at wimbledon. could you talk about performing on ashe stadium where it's so huge, so noisy. what is that like as a professional athlete?
do you ever take a moment before or during the match at all to look up at the arena? it's such a huge, huge arena.
at the end of your match on court you said a few things about 9/11 to the crowd and to new york. what prompted you to say that, and was that planned?
what city were you in?
you lost a lot of big matches to novak this year. before that, i think you were very good against him in big matches. what about him tennis-wise has changed? what are you feeling from him on the court that wasn't there before?
was there ever any player -- i'm assuming roger would be it -- where you didn't have that belief, like you didn't have against novak this year, where you would have those moments? were there other players where you had those same moments where you didn't have that belief?
in your book you described leading up to last year's us open final. you were very complimentary of djokovic. you basically said he had no real weaknesses. how does that affect your approach when you admit that djokovic is solid throughout his game?
andy said to me just a short time ago he felt the mood was a bit different because of the approach of this very sensitive anniversary tomorrow. a lot of new yorkers will be silent at 8:46 and 9:03, the times when the planes impacted the twin towers. just wondering, is that going to be part of your day tomorrow and whether it gives you a different perspective on tennis being here tomorrow at such a sensitive time?
bad luck. beginning of the fourth set, was it crucial to the general outcome? you've come back so well in the third. you had chances.
you went to the net 44 times.
won 33 points.
was that reacting to the circumstances, or was it a conscious strategy that you had worked out before?
the rafa you played today, how does he compare to other chances you've had against him? people have talked about, you know, he hasn't won as many titles as you this year.
did you feel you had feel the momentum at the start of the fourth?
the djokovic/federer match, i presume you saw djokovic's forehand on match point down deep in the fifth.
have you ever seen at crunch time in your experience on a big stage a shot quite like that where he unleashed and handed out that incredible winner?
you talked about the need to be patient after the last match.
what sort of made you go for it a little bit too much?
was the back a slight issue?
was it difficult at all to keep the belief that you can go out and beat rafa on a stage like this?
tomorrow a lot of us will write about andy murray, the best player never to win a slam. is that the kind of thing that bothers you? is it an unfair media story? do you have the confidence it's gonna happen in 2012?
are you at all frustrated by the last few days of having to play those three days in a row and what it meant for you in terms of chances of winning a slam?
do you feel like you will be fit to play davis cup?
is there something about novak's game you think that matches up well against rafa as compared with anybody else?
what does it mean to you to be able to go back and play in scotland in a week's time?
sam was saying before you that the city feels different this week because of the 10th anniversary of 9/11 tomorrow. do you have a slightly different perspective of tennis and life playing just the day before the 10th anniversary?
what's your plan for the week now? when are you heading home?
this must hurt, roger. can you tell us what your feelings are now and where you think it slipped away?
you seemed like you were taking control in the fifth set. how disappointing is it to not be able to kinda keep that momentum going? you certainly had it in that fifth set.
you just said i have no one to blame but yourself. where do you lay the blame?
do you find it amazing that he can come up with two blinding forehands in successive years on match point? the odds are pretty remote, aren't they, of him doing that twice?
could you hit a much better serve for the return he hit that winner?
what did he do better this time than when you played in the french open?
what did you see of novak's reaction and playing to the crowd after he hit that forehand winner? what were you thinking at that point?
when a guy hits a shot like that forehand on match point, is that a function of luck, of risk, or is it a function of confidence that someone would make kind of...
comparing this loss to the tsonga loss in wimbledon being up two sets, how do you react to that? are you more frustrated with this one?
you were really dominant until the first game of the third set, and you made quite a few errors in that game. kinda let him back in the match. given how much longer it went and all the things that happened, how important or unimportant was that game?
after the shot that everyone's talking about, double match point, your next serve was right into his body and he fought it off. that was a good serve, right?
in melbourne, after your run there, you said not so fast, everybody. hold on. let's see how the year unfolds. a lot of great runs, a lot of good victories this year. no slams. what's your assessment of your season? i know you're just coming off a tough loss.
can you put into context this year for the competition, the level of quality of play among the top four compared to, say, the past five years?
when you lost the fourth set or you were close to losing the fourth set, were you trying to save energy for the fifth? no, you didn't have any strategy?
did you notice the crowd's spontaneous eruption in your behalf as you entered the court in the fifth set, and did that contribute to your good start in the fifth set?
you spoke a moment ago about the tough finishes in the slams. how was your belief in yourself different, if at all, today than it was maybe before this season?
your first slam was in 2003 and your last one was 2010. at the end of this year, will you have a different feeling than the last seven?
players have been very vocal and effective in making their views known here. you know the game. do you expect to see major changes here, or do you think things will just revert again and the schedule will be as it is next year again and so on?
this time last year you got to match point, you said you closed your eyes and went for it. was that your mentality on that first match point today?
talk about your belief in your shots, that you'd be able to go for something like that. roger almost seemed baffled that you would take that much of a gamble.
while this match does not yield a trophy moment, can you say that it is perhaps one of the greatest victories of your career?
why?
back to a specific moment in the second set, it was one game apiece and you were ad out and you were second serving. i want to get a sense of how do you compose yourself in a situation like that? and then what kind of plan do you have on a second set serve in that moment?
1-all and you were serving. it was ad out, and nobody had broken yet.
yeah.
just back to that first match point where you had just dropped your serve at love; the crowd is not really on your side; you are getting frustrated. in that shot, was there some anger and frustration? and then what was in your head when you reacted to the crowd after that?
but you seemed to say after that, you know, rocket winner, what do i have to do to get people behind me, no?
everyone now talks about the match point and that it's easy, no? before there was some different moment when everything changed. after the first two sets, federer loses his second game in the third set, and he made a lot of mistakes then. then everything changed. how do you explain what changed then and afterwards? you won all your serves so easily, and then suddenly in the fifth again you are in trouble.
if you had been on the other side of the net watching what happened on that forehand winner that saved a match point and then your communication with the crowd, what do you think you would have been thinking at that point?
if you had been watching that happen as the opponent, what do you think would have been going through your mind?
how about, though, on the shot itself? if that had been done to you, saving a match point...
roger wasn't real happy with what he did with that serve at double match points, but the next one he put it right into you and you fought it off. it ended up being almost just as clutch and almost as important, correct?
in the game he ended up breaking you in the fifth set, after he just won that first point to go to love-15, you were talking to yourself there. did you already let yourself get too negative even in that moment?
was there any point in that match where you thought you were going to lose? also, do you think your amazing run this season helped pull you through that?
what did you exchange in conversation? what did you say to one another? i know it was quick, but what did you say to one another after the match when you were shaking hands?
there's a saying that if you hold yourself through a disaster you will win. when you were coming into the fifth set, you get that feeling?
there's a saying that says if you hold yourself through the disaster, you will win. my question is: did you get that feeling when you're coming into the fifth set?
just considering the season you're having and going into that match, the difference between having two majors or three majors, can you talk about how that affected you going into the match and maybe even during the match how that might have played out in your head?
why are tennis crowds so different than crowds in other sporting events? i can't imaging at madison square garden and the knicks winning by a million points and the crowd starts rooting for the team that's losing.
on court you said that the return of the shot was lucky. could you talk about that? and secondly, you probably hit millions of shots. was that the best shot novak djokovic has ever hit?
there's another exciting match coming up later tonight, a friend you're close with, caroline wozniacki. how do you see her game against serena williams?
you had a high profile fan rooting you on today in sean "diddy" combs. how did that come about?
you're having a great season. andy murray is having a good season, already four semifinals in 2011. he could be your opponent in the final.
considering that you're amidst a historic season, on monday do you think you'll have the crowd support wanting to see you complete this incredible year?
when you lost to federer at roland garros, everyone said it was the best federer of the season. today you lost the first two sets. were you thinking that he was playing even better? i saw you were looking at your corner a lot, like, what can i do?
but my question was if federer was playing better or...
you addressed the possibility of facing andy murray. if it is rafa, what sort of challenge is that for you, knowing your history, knowing that you met in the finals last year, finals at wimbledon, everything else? what is the key for you?
you have been in such an incredible zone this year. at the level that you're playing, are you past the point of being surprised by anything that you do on the court? what i mean is, when you launched that forehand on match point and it sticks, are you like, well, that's the level i'm at now, or are you stunned by what you're able to do every once in a while still?
how would you sum that up?
how bad was the leg? looked like it tightened up on you.
you could feel it even in warmups this morning?
how much did all of that influence your strategy? because you did attack a lot today.
did you contemplate pulling out at any point?
i'm just curious about your philosophy of feeling like you should play to conclusion.
how would you compare his level of play today compared to other matches you've played against him?
given your limited preparation, what do you take from this?
what you felt today was cumulative? you didn't feel it in the ferrer match?
on another topic, roger talked at some length about super-saturday; you have been involved in a few of those. has that outlived its time, do you think?
obviously a disappointing finish for you and for john today. but on the whole, would you say this was a step forward for the american side?
on the flip side of that, the second grand slam this year where the top four seeds go through and it's the top four players in the world. how difficult will it be for anyone to crack that top four going forward, and how impressive is that top four?
your serve and forehand are obviously your weapons. you talked about the trouble with your serve; you had zero forehand winners. what is it like to be out there? can you describe the feeling when you know that rafael nadal is hitting on all cylinders and you're trying to summon something and it's just not there?
were you able to have fun at all today?
did you voice your opinion on moving the final to monday with the organizers, or did you have anything to do with that?
do you have any sense of whether the players had any kind of...
you talked about negativity in the media a few times this week. how different do you think the media is now compared to when you grew up reading about agassi and pete and everybody?
you have had some major accomplishments and some great runs. what's this place and this tournament still mean to you?
the crowd's silence, how did you interpret that? do you think they felt sorry for you? sad for you?
how do you approach the rest of the year? are you gonna play a lot or just kinda say, you know, look to 2012 or...
(question about being in the top 10.)
what's the precise nature of the injury over the summer, the precise description of it?
for the second slam this year, the top four players in the world will play in the semifinals and into the finals. what does it say about that group of four, and how tough it is to break into that between the four of you guys?
you're obviously very high up, but if you're in the 10s or the 20s and you're looking, you're thinking, i don't only have to topple nadal, djokovic, federer, murray, i mean, that is a gauntlet to have to get through to win a tournament. how daunting do you think that is for the players that are lower ranked looking at that solid a group up there?
you were aggressive today. were you trying to think of keeping the match short?
do you think you have been getting better and better as the tournament has progressed?
how happy are you that the final has been pushed to monday?
were you involved in discussions with the organizers about the schedule at all, about the change to monday?
they said that it was a collaboration between the players and the tv and the organizers. so do you know which players were involved, if any players were involved?
when you know andy is hurting but he won't retire, he won't quit, do you appreciate that? how does that affect your approach?
how hungry are you to defend your title and win this last slam of the season with the passion that you describe?
how are you going to prepare for this tonight? what do you see yourself doing or not doing?
the players were very angry. do you feel coming out of this slam you're confident that perhaps players can get together and make some real changes, or do you fear it's just going to be a bit a controversy here and then go away and nothing will change?
andy murray said he thinks it's a closer matchup between you two on hard courts than on clay or grass. is that how you see it, too?
is there any problem with your back? you were clutching at it?
how satisfying is that in all the circumstances, the opponent, the circumstances of the match, the tournament?
what is that mental pressure like playing with someone with his style?
with the way you're feeling now, how do you think you'll be tomorrow?
there is a stat going around that you're the seventh man to get to the semis of all the grand slams in the same year. is that pretty gratifying to reach that stat?
how big a point was that in the fourth set when he had the breakpoint and you just managed to half volley that win?
john said the wind was a bit of a factor for him. was it for you? what was it like out there?
it looks as if we're going to get the top four in the semifinals again. can you talk a little bit about that, this stranglehold you guys have got on the slams is pretty impressive, isn't it, over the last few years?
how would you feel about a sunday start here and spacing things out a little better?
the french example doesn't appeal to you?
if we could assume that rafa's two sets up, this is becoming quite a familiar scenario for you right now, playing him in the semis of a slam. do you feel that maybe each time it happens you've learned something from the last time? it's never gonna be easy, but do you think it gives you any more chance?
tournament supervisors said the decision to move the match was a collaborative decision between the tournament and the players. were you involved in that and what are your opinions?
were you expecting them to make that announcement, or was it a surprise to the players?
this is the third time in a row that you've played, if it is rafa in the semis. what in particular will you need to do if you're gonna get past him?
mary joe's haircut. you seemed to like it.
(comment about rio ferdinand tweets.)
we've got three boys in the junior semifinals. is that an encouraging thought?
john, despite the fact you lost, do you feel you played some of the best tennis you've ever played in that match?
how badly was your ankle bothering you?
is there one or two points in that fourth set that are gonna give you nightmares tonight, for the next week?
what about in the tiebreaker? you had the two dropshots that hit the net.
i think it was 5-2.
did you get nervous? this is your first chance at a spot like this.
if you take a step back and you look at the two weeks as a whole, having the best results of your career so far? i mean, how do you think you will look back at this?
when you go home, what will you work on? you said you were rolling the ball in. what will you work on?
with your serve, a lot of people think you have potential to be a top 10 player, and i think you think the same thing. what is separating you from making that leap at this point?
now that it's behind you, can you tell us how much the rain delay affected your feeling today? do you think it would be a good idea to start the tournament maybe a day earlier?
they do it at the french. has that helped you there at all? have you felt any advantage starting on a sunday?
roger is pretty emphatic that super-saturday, its time has come and gone.
playing the final and semifinal back to back. it's the only major that does that. federer said last night its time has come and gone. it should be gone. what's your take on that?
first time us open quarterfinals, ashe venue; what was there that nobody could describe that now you've been there you know what it's like? what were you feeling that nobody can tell you about?
when you look back on all your shot selections, did you okay all the dropshots that you tried, or was that a little bit of a shot selection because of the new environments?
being in the tiebreak, was that kind of where you wanted to be? you have had such success in tiebreaks. did you feel at the beginning of that, okay, this is exactly my kind of situation?
with the way murray has been playing right now, how do you like his chances against the big 3 or roddick if he comes back in this match?
how is his return compared to other people you've served against?
that first set when you guys were at 5-all and you broke him and you guys were on serve, how disappointing was that, because your serve is such a great weapon for you?
with you, andy, and mardy having a great run here, does that take some of the pressure off of what's wrong with american men's tennis? how do you feel about that? you made the mark.
how many shirts did you get through today?
you said it took you a while to get going, until the third set. do you have a reason for that?
talk about the breakpoint. did that linger longer than it should have in the fourth set?
you've played on that court before.
just this year you're saying?
tough luck, donald. you look pretty bummed out by how it went.
did two days, pretty much almost two full days of delay other than that little period you played, were they a momentum killer given what you did earlier in the tournament, how you were feeling, what you were thinking?
obviously you have just come off the court and you're disappointed. but do you think with the success that you did have here you'll leave this tournament as a different player?
of all the firsts that you had in this tournament, what stands out for you?
how do you think you'll look back on the year you've had so far and the tournament you've had here?
what do you think is the reason for all of this?
you played a quality player today. andy has been picked by many as a pretournament favorite. you know, with the unforced errors and so forth maybe you didn't give him the game that you would have liked to have given him, but talk about andy and the way he played you today.
talk about how much you relish the opportunity to play top players in the world when you have those opportunities, and how disappointing it might be that you weren't able to give him your a game today.
you turned pro at 14.
what's different in your feeling about your future today than maybe at the start of the tournament, if at all?
what do you do now? do you take advantage of the direct entry into all the tournaments you can? do you go back and work a little more?
do you think the court was playable yesterday when they put you out there, and shouldn't you have been in the player meeting with the players yesterday?
do you think there was a safety issue yesterday when you were out there?
what part of your game do you still have to work on?
after two days off waiting and starting and stopping, how difficult is it today to recalibrate yourself before you go out there?
what do you think should have been done differently, if anything, in the handling of the rain and the court situation?
some players go out on tour, and maybe they just travel with the coach or a small entourage. some people are tighter with their family. obviously it's a big thing for you. talk a little bit about that family bond and what that means to you.
do you remember when you first started playing tennis?
nice way to end this surreal couple of days, huh?
talk about the experience a little bit. obviously it was a strange start this morning with the court bubbling up, et cetera.
i heard you used the word "baffled" on the court.
was brian advocating that you continue to play on that court?
what do you think of playing on court 13?
those memories aside, i mean, having been out there today and won there today, ferrer kind of laughed at me when i asked this before, but i'm going to ask you: was there anything charming or cool about that experience? and conversely, what was annoying about it, whether it's the lack of hawk-eye or, you know, what was good and what was bad?
there were photographs, you know, close to the court. there was a guy on the fence, a baby crying. it was bizarre conditions.
was it just a combination, or was there anything that really stood out to you that was particularly hilarious?
the playing surface itself, like a basketball court, is that the difference at all, or is it just the surroundings?
the 24 hours starting when you guys had to go out for a few minutes yesterday morning; people seemed unhappy about that. is this as strange a 24-hour period you've been in in tennis?
isn't that the mark of a champion athlete, accepting what's there and not worrying about the little things and just playing the game?
having said that, rafa was quite peeved when he came in here and said that, you know, the players need to have more of a say in what's going on. even sam stosur said that. what would you say? she said without them there's no tournament.
do you feel you get a large enough portion of the revenues?
about that.
was this tournament for you any kind of tipping point in your thinking about this?
are you, at your age, convinced a 24 year old could maybe to give up a year of his career?
you come into the open and you hadn't had that much play. this might have been the biggest one of the year, and now you have a chance to play rafa. talk about your game and how excited you are to have that chance.
tell us about facing rafa now.
andy murray quipped about hoping it rains tonight. then at least roger will be in the same boat as the rest of you guys. can you talk about the inequity in the halves of the draw?
some tough slams and a rough davis cup outing and so forth. does this great run take a little edge off of that? do you feel pretty good?
just talk about playing on a small court. do you just feel your juices more intensely, feel more into the match...
that's all i think about.
when you said you'd like to leave the sport better than you came to it, are you suggesting you could be the person to unite...
the nfl is back after its work stoppage, even though it didn't miss regular season games. what's your pick for the super bowl and why?
as an american, what would it mean to be around on sunday for such an emotional day?
can you talk about the rain and what happened yesterday at all?
yeah, i did.
well, wondering if anything has changed since then to your match today. andy roddick had to move courts. just curious if you've changed...
how hard was it for you to start the match today knowing you were down 3-love, down a break, and you had to think about it overnight and come back out today and start another day?
at the start of the seventh game, were you thinking that that was the time to break him? you were very active in the return of service.
right.
specifically about today, what do you think about your game is working and what do you think really put him offbalance?
you're looking at playing four matches in four days, possibly.
right. but the person from your side of the draw to emerge will have to play four matches in four days.
last night when you left here, can you speak about what you did, when you got to sleep. was it difficult to sort of come down off the night?
don't you think that players have some responsibility if situation is like this? don't you think that already in the past the players should have done something to fight against a super-saturday? they should have done something to avoid the first round that ends on wednesday and all those kind of things? because you have more power than you think, but you should be more united than you are. that's my opinion.
i want to know you, what you think about it.
about all this, what i said.
to just follow up on that, there are people...
can you just say what kind of reaction you've gotten from other players who maybe weren't even here yesterday but heard what you and the andys did?
would you address the topic of your next match, as you suggested, facing andy roddick? how would you describe that challenge for you?
i know the conditions have been tough out there. we just spoke with nadal, and he said the problems as he saw it, it had not to do with the officials, but representation. what does he mean by that? do you think changing representation would change the rain policy out here at all in the future?
he said the representation of the players here in the tournament, and that that should change.
well, how do you think if that was different that might change the rain on the court, calls like that?
i think he was talking about how he was upset, all three of you were.
do you think commercial interests trump player well-being?
do you think it's more so here than in other tournaments, particularly grand slams?
are the players frustrated with the fact they haven't had a roof put on? this seems to be the same conversation.
what kind of reaction have you gotten from other players for the stand that you and andy and rafael took? some people are saying it's a watershed moment in terms of players actually standing up for themselves.
you're facing the prospect of four matches in four days. is that daunting or does that not enter into your mind?
what do you think about the fact that the top half of the draw are playing their quarterfinals today?
now that you've won, can you sympathize with him at all for having a big moment here? he got some momentum here, which has been hard for him to do in his career, and he's got to wait two days. did you feel any sympathy for him, or do you think that played any kind of a role in his performance today?
there has actually been some suggestion that they could play best of three just try to get it in on before sunday at some stage.
what are your thoughts on the opponent, possible opponent for the next match?
given the situation, how pleased were you with the way you handled things out there and the way you played?
how dramatic a stand do you think the players would take for the future to make the us open kind of go in line with the other slams in terms of having a day between semifinal and finals, et cetera?
six months ago you were in a bit of i slump; no doubt about that. you lost to this guy, young; today you owned him. where did you get the inner strength? where was the support coming? when did you finally know that you were going to get this game of yours back?
has going through that made you stronger today?
if someone, another player, came up to you and said, i want to start a players' union totally independent of tournament directors who you're kind of in league with at the moment, a complete separate players' union which has been tried before, would you support that?
because it has been tried before and there just wasn't the unity to do it.
obviously you read about some of your colleagues on wednesday were upset about having to go out on the court. felt like their careers were in jeopardy. there's always going to be a balance between the promoter trying to make money and long-time career health issues. has there ever been a time you said, i'm not going to go out there or tried to rally some of your comrades, wait a minute; this is not a good idea?
so for the fourth year in a row the final is gonna be played on a monday. what are your thoughts on that?
just to follow up on that, it seems like they moved the final to monday so nadal and roddick's half of the draw wouldn't have to play four matches in four days. do you think that would have been difficult for those guys? does it give you and fed any kind of advantage that you have tomorrow off?
talking to janko, he seems genuinely agonized over the decision that he had to retire.
he said that had he not had davis cup upcoming, that he would have fought it out there and he would have stayed. i wonder what that says to you. what does that say about him, you know, prioritizing about davis cup in the midst of a grand slam championship?
before i asked nadal if he thought that the players had some responsibility in not fighting against this calendar and the fact that there is a super-saturday at the us open. he say, well, all players have to be united. it's not just me and federer and djokovic, which is true. but at the same time, super-saturday is something that is played only by the top four or five or six, eight players. so is actually the big ones, the top ones who have to...
you lost your first set of the tournament today. is there anything that you need to specifically work on? you have tsonga or federer up next. is there anything you feel you really need to focus on?
just briefly, it's pretty obvious that you want to shorten the schedule. what would you do with davis cup, and would you get rid of super-saturday?
on a much different note, changing topics, you have been wearing your unicef pin during the tournament. if you could switch gears during a moment and talk about why, coming from such a troubled situation at home, you decided to...
you talk about a roof. don't you think the schedule of the us open itself should be revised a little bit like you have three days first round starting monday and super-saturday has already been discussed? do you have just some thoughts on that?
speaking with janko earlier, he said this match was very big for your country. can you speak about what it was like to play him in the quarterfinals of the us open? also, the days before the match had you heard any types of indications of excitement back home about the match coming up?
how did you manage to pull that victory out?
a couple of times it seemed like you were complaining to mardy about noise from his box. were people in his box bothering you?
when you say you're strong in the head, how does that reveal itself on the court now? is it how you play key points? is it your relaxation on the court?
did the way you came back against roger help you today?
once you're down that two sets to one, you know that to win you have to go to five, just how strong is your confidence that you can win any five-set match?
is it extra special winning a five-set match more than just any other match? is it more special beating an american at the us open than it is just beating anybody else at this stage of the game?
what is the hardest shot to control in the wind when the conditions are like this?
given your experience playing against federer, what do you imagine will go through your mind and how will it affect you if you get to play him in the next round?
what's the key for you to have that sort of success?
you mentioned mardy talking about somebody in your box. at that point he used some foul language on the court. did you think that was directed at you or at the umpire?
mardy used some foul language on the court at that point. did you think that was directed at you or was it directed at the umpire, mardy's anger?
you didn't hear it?
tough way to end a great summer. how are you feeling about your effort in the match?
you both were battling the elements.
did you feel as if your upper right thigh betrayed you a little in that fifth set?
in the fifth set you and tsonga exchanged words as you were changing over. can you tell us what happened there?
when you said, i don't speak french, then kind of an expletive, were you talking to jo-wilfried?
with the showing of the u.s. men - four guys in the 16 - what do you take away as far as a resurgence, rebirth of men's tennis in the u.s. from this?
was there a point where you felt the momentum really turn away from you even before he got the break?
what exactly was bothering you with your leg?
on a different subject, your hometown is being considered as a host for the usa/belarus fed cup matches next year. what are your thoughts on that?
there were forecasts for rain all day today. it hasn't come yet. was there any point during the match where you were looking at the heavens waiting for it to start?
where does this place as far as disappointing losses?
patrick said before the match that he thought it was going to be mostly mental for you. what was the difference, in your opinion, in this match?
you've had an excellent season. obviously you still have a couple more shots at a masters title. the grand slam season is done. are you still looking for that semifinal? how does this feel coming out of this?
with the four of you guys that got into the second week, do you feel that's a positive trend?
obviously your hard court success this summer is part of the reason that you got so few days off. the schedule you just went through is kind of exhausting. do you think as you look towards next year you might recalibrate how many tournaments you ought to even enter?
how will you look back at what you accomplished this summer?
what do you think happened in the tiebreak and why did you lose that tiebreak?
everybody knows about your talent, your different game. what do you think you need to be really in the top?
after you lost the heartbreaking tiebreaker, did you have a feeling it was djokovic, that was it right there?
was that the most exciting atmosphere and tiebreak you ever played? did you enjoy the crowd?
during the tiebreak, novak was smiling during the second half of it. seemed like he had an appreciation of how much fun it was. did you have an appreciation of how much fun the tiebreak was and were you having fun playing it?
can you talk about his mental toughness. do you think players find it increasingly tough to play against him now because he's so mentally strong?
you had four set points in the tiebreak. did you think at any point it could be the one where you could pull it out?
did you ever play with santoro and what do you think about him?
they say you are the new santoro. what do you think about that?
you went through six set points in that crazy tiebreaker. how was it for you?
on the first set, the tiebreak, do you attribute winning that more to your physical strength or your mental strength?
is it difficult to play slice backhand against dolgopolov who plays also slice backhand? do you know that he was losing 4-1 in the fifth with cipolla?
everyone talks about the physical attributes that have made you no.1. how would you assess your mental game, how it's improved over the past year?
were you annoyed by the crowd?
what do you feel about the crowd?
rafa recently said that tennis at its heart is a game of dealing with emergencies. today in the tiebreak you had an incredible emergency. compare the open with your third-round match at wimbledon against baghdatis where you hit your racquet and seemed to kick-start your game somehow.
were you made aware that the crowd for louis armstrong today almost snaked out of the grounds right across the other side of the courtyard? it was almost half a mile long to get into your court.
did anyone tell you that?
before the match had even started.
apart from the wimbledon queue, i don't think anyone has seen anything like it.
rafa, in his book, says if you keep grinding against roger you can eventually wear him down, force him into making some errors, but against you there's really no backup plan. that's a pretty good compliment from a 10-time slam champ. i wanted your thoughts on that. and are you starting to feel that advantage before you even step on the court, that psychological advantage that you bring?
the psychological advantage. are you starting to feel that now?
can you talk about the impact of your parents on your life and on your tennis life. is there anything you wish they had done differently with you when you were younger?
is there any advice they gave you along the way that stands out in your mind?
speaking of your homeland, your opponent tipsarevic talked a lot about facing you. one of the things he talked about was whether it's harder or easier to face someone you're familiar with. what is your mental approach?
he said it's both easier and harder.
ana ivanovic was noting that there will definitely be a serbian into the semis. we were talking to her about serbian tennis. she said that serbians have quite a combustible character and maybe that's what is driving us. can you comment on that?
andy was asked or told that we've been complaining about american tennis not being very good. obviously nobody in the second week of wimbledon. now there will be at least four american men in the second week here. nice competition. do you see an improvement there?
you said that everybody's light comes on at a different time. has your light come on and why?
is it possible that the twitter incident was a good thing?
jose was saying it got everything out in the open.
you've said you've done a lot of different things in the off-season. could you be a little more specific.
what prompted you going there?
how difficult has it been with all the expectation on your shoulders from such a young age and the results not coming?
how much do you know about your potential next two opponents? you played murray earlier this year.
you've had expectations and people have opinions pro and con. today out on the court you were surrounded by a stadium full of people that were a hundred percent for you. what did that feel like?
coming out of here, what do you need to do next?
when you were serving for the first set you got broken. you might have said a few not nice words on the court, slammed down your racquet. you were going through a rough patch. what's going through your mind and how did you get it back together?
what's the biggest court you played on? you've played on ashe before.
what do you expect the next two days to be like?
how big a result was beating andy murray in the spring?
at your lowest point, did you ever feel like you'd never experience a run like you're having?
what do you think it was that you decided to stick it out?
when you got to the lowest point. why a forward jump?
do you feel now, stepping on court here, differently in terms of your confidence and your own expectations of yourself than you have in the past?
you're unique because you can play all court, soft hands. i wonder how much of what's happening now is the product of confidence and how much is growing into your game and learning where to play on the court?
if you did play murray, it would be a different venue, much bigger occasion than indian wells. do you feel you'll be able to handle that?
if it is andy murray, will it be the biggest game of your life?
you have a style that's different from most of the players. kind of have that agassi thing going where you have the earrings, the sideways hat. how does style play into your life and is it important to you?
you must be very proud of your performance today. which part do you think was most satisfying for you?
how difficult is it mentally to keep up your focus and your desire to run down the kind of ball he hits?
were you angry at yourself when you went down love-40? did it almost inspire you in a way?
the last time a lot of us talked to you you were in a rush to leave here and get on the plane to go home. tell us what that trip was like.
was he already at home by the time you got home? was he still at the hospital? where did you actually see him?
is he here this week?
is he walking, talking?
first of all, what are your thoughts on how rafa is playing right now? how would you describe the match today?
what are your thoughts about his level in general right now? obviously he's lost the no.1 ranking to djokovic. how do you see things shaping up here for the second week at the open?
about rafa, forgive me if you addressed this: what do you think of his serve today? how effective was that? it seemed a little more conservative sometimes.
going for the percentage?
you must be happy. david is a tough competitor, but are you happy with the way you played?
you said after the match that this was your best game so far. are there parts of your game still that you're not too happy with that you feel you need to work on?
you were looking a moment ago at the monitor. have you seen much of donald young? what are your observations of young's career and the way he plays?
22. 21 or 22.
i think there have been 18 players who have withdrawn or retired from the tournament this year. what do you think of that, and is the tennis schedule too long during the entire year?
on court you're so intense, so focused. you have such drive. off the court you're a very humble man, very kind, down-to-earth. some say there's no other player like that.
not sad, but you're very intense. in your book you say you never smile. ask roger. every point is a battle, and so relaxed off court. i think you know what i'm talking about, just the difference in the two parts of your personality. could you just talk about that a little bit, please.
it's not your conduct on court. it's tremendous. it's just the focus.
was the 11:00 a.m. start a factor in the first set being so close? was it a bit tricky to play him then? normally that doesn't happen to you.
your relationship with your uncle toni is a complicated one in that he was tough on you growing up.
he was pretty tough on you growing up, as you said, to push you, and yet, as you said, you wouldn't be where you are today without him. is it necessary in tennis to be an elite player to have somebody behind you that's gonna push you pretty hard sometimes?
agassi said before that he had a lot of anxiety when he was releasing his biography; he had some nerves about revealing his personal life. how did you feel when you let the book come out and see a lot of personal sides of you? did you feel any anxiety?
andre agassi when he released his book open, he expressed that he was very nervous about how people would perceive his personal life? did you feel the same by releasing your book, nervous about releasing things like that?
did you read the book?
there is quite a bit in the book that's very outspoken that tells us a lot about your experiences with toni, your experiences with your family, your pain. you're still comfortable with that? you have no problem with expressing those things in your book?
what gets you more excited: your own big victories or real madrid's big victories?
can you describe your thoughts on your first week of play here and on your next match?
seems like since you've been playing at the open, most of your matches have been out on armstrong. does it feel like when you go out there there's almost a home-court advantage at this point?
with your next match, simon, you never played him before. what do you know about him? what ideas do you have going in?
how much are you getting to be known as john isner instead of the wimbledon guy?
do you have any feelings that we have four americans in the round of 16? does that surprise you or make you happy?
i don't think so.
when you see that your opponent is injured like that, do you change your plan with that in mind or do you stick with the tactics that you have in the beginning originally?
you're top 20; been in the fourth round of majors before. do you feel like you're ready to really make a bigger push beyond that?
then how do you know that you're ready to make that next level?
what led you to be more serious, if that's the right word, this year? was it the davis cup? was it novak's example? what?
you had, i think in belgrade, the muscle tear, i think, in your thigh?
i think at the time in belgrade you thought it was a six inch tear.
was it not as bad as that?
there is something different about this, though, because this is the first time you've gotten to the second week at the us open; your results have kept going up here. first and second round, and then your best showing last year with the third round and now the fourth round this year. is there something about just maybe you're more comfortable with the atmosphere in new york and this tournament?
why didn't you like playing the states?
because you said a few moments ago you never came into a season with the goal of being in the top 20.
i'm thinking was some of it your talent? were you selling yourself a little bit short? why did you never have this aspiration?
i think when i spoke to you earlier you told me the thing about novak was he was always somebody who would have fun, but when it was time for tennis he worked extremely hard.
he always had that priority. he obviously has had this great season. did you take that example from him?
ana was saying the other day that like novak, she's gluten free, so i have to ask...
what are the ingredients?
you have tweeted about transportation woes at the us open, so playing an early match, how early did you order your car today?
when were the transport problems?
when was the day you were having trouble?
how would you assess that match?
why did you become less aggressive?
how do you feel about the way you're serving at this point?
do you have any sense from the fans? are they now saying, i want to watch fish play today, where in the past it would have been, there's this american playing over there?
is it good having the chanting for you during the match or does it at any point in tense moments ratchet up the pressure?
what observations do you have of the route donald young has taken to this point, and what are your thoughts about what he's doing right now?
you've spoken a great deal about the transformation in your career. what is different about him today than a few years ago, in your estimation?
you say he has a lot of game. what are his attributes that most impress you?
you talked about how fired up donald got yesterday and he drew the crowd in. one of the commentators was saying during your match that you're not a fiery personality, that you're more of a mellow personality. so when you hit a lull in that match, you don't really have the fieriness to draw in the crowd to get them behind you. what do you say?
your comeback is pretty inspiring. what element of that are you most proud of, and was there one moment where you really turned it around?
51% of the points today.
i don't know. i'm quoting you. we'll figure it out. it was clearly a close match. if your goal is to make a long run, how big is it to get out in three hard sets?
must feel pretty good. cilic is a tough player. how did you feel you played out there?
you play mostly night matches here. what's it like playing at 1:00 in the afternoon when the stadium is only half filled and then gets more filled obviously during the match? is it different?
you said that you thought took the momentum in the third. when he was called for the time violation do you think that took anything out of him? he seemed to double fault and then you just...
you're obviously so fluid out there on the court, but also pretty fluent with languages. can you just take a minute and just talk about language, compare the three different major languages you speak, which is the most expressive? what do you think in? just talk about the different languages you speak.
what do you think and dream in?
i noticed the tiebreak stats, which you are world leader of all time. can you talk about what goes through your mind in the tiebreak, and can you practice for it anyhow?
what are your thoughts on and observations of the career of donald young and his recent progress?
there has been more retirements, more players retiring this...
than ever.
can you pinpoint any possible reason? there has been some talk about balls being different.
in his book, rafa says federer is more technically gifted than i am, his serve is better than mine, his volley, his forehand is probably more decisive than mine; his slice backhand definitely is, and his positioning on the court is better, too. i just wanted to get your reaction to that. also wondered what you thought might be, if anything, better in his game than yours.
do you believe any of the other players can be as dominant as you have been with the single handed backhand?
of the up and comers, do you see the single-handed backhand going away?
here in america, arguably the foremost athlete of our era is tiger, and rafa recently said he idolizes tiger more than anyone. you've obviously hung out with him. he's obviously gone through some really tough stretches here. could you take a moment and reflect on that situation and what some of your thoughts are on the struggle he's been going through?
so does that say that focus and confidence for an elite-level athlete are very precious things and can go off...
what are your thoughts about the road ahead for tiger and the possibility of breaking his sports record for majors?
how much tennis do you watch when you're not playing?
your girls are two now. what's it like to see them pick up a racquet and imitate dad?
if they want to become tennis players, are you gonna say yes to that?
can you assess your game this week? are you on track? how do you feel you're playing?
how was the wind today? was that a factor at all?
either juan monaco or tommy haas in the next round. what do you think about their games at the current moment? what would be the game plan as to each of them?
what's your sense when you watch serena williams on a roll, her dominance on the women's side? what do you admire most about her game?
gluten-free diet seems to have become more fashionable among tennis players. is it something you ever gave thought to? is there anything you don't eat?
you had the trainer out at the end of the first set but you never took a formal injury timeout. why was that?
so what it is actually?
that semifinal in cincinnati, that was the first time you had felt that pain?
was it bothering you here before today, or was today the first day it was really a problem since you've been here?
is rest the only way to recover?
do you have any sense of how long it's gonna be before you can be back playing matches?
i guess all the slams for the year are over now. you've had a fairly good year from a slam perspective.
you're down two sets to one. what happened to donald young, whom we worried with from about 15 years and so on?
where does all this confidence come from and what will you do to continue it?
how hard was it to hold serve to get into that fifth-set tiebreak?
how much of the incredible crowd support energized you, especially in the fifth set?
this was your first five-set win of your career. in your view, was this more a mental breakthrough today or a physical breakthrough?
when you were serving for the match, was it nerves?
was this the biggest win of your career?
you have been criticized in the past for your fitness level. is that a breakthrough you've made this year?
what sort of motivation did you have at the lowest points of your career that carried you until now, and what are you feel being those lows when you're at this high?
what's your feeling now about having stuck with it?
after the match, patrick mcenroe tweeted, donald young has become a man today. what are your thoughts about that?
what is your relationship now with the usta?
if you were in the room with the usta having a tall one, what would you say?
what life lessons can you take at this point in your career? are there some things that stick out for you as far as lessons?
you mentioned that tennis was a job, and at the end of the day you still have to go to work. do you take as much joy on the court as when you were 15?
do you think you would have been better off, looking back, if they hadn't really had all this fanfare about you, the next great american, all that pressure, that it might have been an easier road for you?
going into that tiebreaker, what was your mindset and approach?
did the work with pete earlier in the year, was that a nice, brief interlude, or did that have some lasting effect?
what do you think you've proven to yourself after some of those depths that you experienced?
is this the start of growing up?
are you going to watch jack and christina? what advice would you give them?
obviously you got the win today. is it difficult spending less than an hour on the court in terms of preparation for your next match?
he hurt you with his serve the last time you played. could you tell that he was not right with the serve today from the start?
you couldn't tell a difference from the last time you met him?
the only time you played him.
in your book what you say is, what i battle hardest to do in a tennis match is to quiet the voices in my head. i was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit.
after your previous match, i believe you said you were a little tentative. are you feeling more confident now as you're moving into this tournament?
he said after the match that he felt like you didn't have quite the same confidence you had a year ago, didn't feel like you were going for the shots as much as you used to be. do you think that's correct?
have you had opportunities to see djokovic, federer, and murray, and how would you assess how they're playing?
do you like watching tennis?
i mean, when you get away from the court, do you watch as much as you can or do you try to get away from it?
you got through this match relatively easy, unlike andy's match. in terms of the opportunity to get out there in the second round, and to really get a feel for the court you talk about adjusting. in a way, do you prefer to be tested a little bit, or is it nice to get through in 1 hour and 20 minutes?
david nalbandian tomorrow?
rafa, in the book you say, manacor is about as far away from new york as is possible to imagine. i wonder in what ways this sticks out for you from where you grew up?
are you comfortable in both, or do you prefer a quieter setting?
talk about the match.
you got the one break in the first set with some good defense and scrambling, and then the break in the second with a couple of good volleys. those are elements of your game that you perhaps aren't quite as well-known for. can you just talk about the work you've been putting in off the courts that really add to all the elements of the game?
so how would you compare your confidence level at this moment with other times in your career?
you are a different player from chile, the davis cup. i know that was on clay of courts, but that was really a down point.
so you've done something?
this is the only grand slam to have a tiebreaker in the fifth set. you have had experience with, how it works in the other three slams obviously. do you have a preference for which way you think a set should end and which way is more fair?
is that kind of what makes it, i guess, stand out different in approach of a fifth set differently than if you were at wimbledon?
what are your thoughts about tonight's roddick/sock matchup, and how would you describe jack?
who do they play?
tough one.
what's your scouting report on that big georgia/boise state game that some observers say is going to be the game of the weekend?
where are you going to be watching it?
alex bogomolov, who you probably will play in the next round, was talking yesterday about the challenger circuit and how he was essentially stuck there for several years. that's a level that you escaped past pretty quickly. can you just talk about your time playing at that level and how difficult it is to make that transition from the challengers to the atp tour?
you said you like the tiebreak but you want the others to stay the way they are. why is that?
i know you said you don't watch a lot of tennis, but you've probably seen a lot of americans on the schedule today, and the young ones, you know, even veterans, just getting through the first few rounds. do you think we're seeing a revival in american tennis?
that doesn't look like a new cap. is there a story behind that?
is that what brought good luck to the bulldogs since you've worn it?
what about with robby? were you surprised how well you saw him play today, and do you see him continuing to go climb back up?
coming back from injury is something that you've had experience with when you had mono a few years ago. for the club tennis player being one or two months away from tournaments, it doesn't seem like that big of a deal, but can you just talk about how much that would impact somebody at the pro level, just even being away for a month or two months and getting your feet back into it?
how surprised are you to be here after what recent history has been like for you?
does this comeback have a different feeling from the others?
where do you feel your game is now?
when you sort of think about your career, do you feel unlucky? is it something mechanical? is it biological? how do you sort of make sense of what your career has been like from the injury standpoint?
how has having a family changed things for you?
did you feel maybe you bought some time on the back end because you had so many years where you didn't put a lot of mileage on?
can you just give us an update on your citizenship? for a while seemed like you were bouncing around there a little.
who are you representing? you're playing here as a german?
what do you have to do? what's the process?
how would you assess your play so far? pretty uneventful week.
sloane stephens talked today about how she practices at ucla and she sees you and sam there. are you aware of her much?
have you ever hit with her?
have you seen her game at all?
she beat peer today.
so you haven't been tested in the first two matches. that's good news. is it also that's the bad news?
you talked a lot about the physical stuff. you seem to have sort of developed an inner peace from what i can see. talk about that a little bit.
which nebraskan are you going to root for tomorrow night?
when you were jack's age, all these up-and-coming players, what is some advice you wish someone had given you at a young age?
three years ago you played the third-latest ending match against rafael.
can you explain what the difference is playing at 2 a.m. and 2 p.m. just from conditions, ball, and also your body clock.
do you think there should be a ceiling on how late they can start a match?
talk about the luck of the draw when you come into a slam and you sort of maybe cross your fingers that things will roll out well for you. but with the big four, including murray and that group, nadal, federer, djokovic, you sort of know that no matter where it shakes out you're going to probably end up facing them.
you have roger in your quarter. you know that going in.
is there any part of you that wishes somebody beats them before you or not?
but you have to put yourself in that mindset, too. sounds like you're a new player in several respects. you have to come in thinking, i'm going to beat whoever's out there.
the match before yours lasted nearly five hours. how do you prepare for a situation like that?
what do you do if you take a meal and the guy retires, 3-0 in the first set? you just had a big burger and the guy retires?
has it happened where you've overeaten before going on the court?
are there any parts of your game in the first couple matches that you feel like you want to fine-tune before anderson?
have you ever played federer when he was fine-tuning?
he says you guys are friends. do you socialize at all?
is your dog here with you?
who takes care of the dog?
good effort today. you must be very happy with yourself.
looked like when he came back and won the third set like maybe it was slipping away from you a little bit. he was starting to smack the ball pretty well. were you concerned at that point?
were you worried in the fourth set that it was slipping away when he broke you?
the crowd was really behind you. did that really propel you?
what was tougher, winning this match today or winning kalamazoo back to back?
how well do you know roddick, who is winning at the moment?
have you practiced with him?
in austin or on the road?
did you choose red and white specifically because they're husker colors?
so what's being said about the climate of the americans at the us open. i'm sure you hear about it, too. had an hbo special on it a couple weeks ago. does that propel you younger guys saying, watch out for the americans? i know two of the girls made the third round; you won today. does that propel you a little bit?
you insisted on playing high school tennis.
what was your record?
falconi carried an american flag onto arthur ashe today after she won.
what kind of superstitions or things do you do to prepare for a match? anything that's constant?
you working closely with the player development program or doing your own thing?
you've turned pro?
was that a tough decision or not?
do you think college is something you'll eventually want to go to?
your parents were fine with that decision?
did you leave any scholarships on the table to go pro?
you feel physically ready for it?
your brother plays for the nebraska tennis team?
was it a tough decision for you to make? did you agonize over it?
i guess you could play the juniors this year, too.
it's there any relief, even though you're young, having gotten a grand slam win under your belt?
who you playing with in mixed?
do you come into the us open with goals?
who are your heroes as far as tennis is concerned and who do you like here at the open?
there's another sport in nebraska considerably more important than tennis. how does a kid from nebraska end up being focused on tennis just to get into the mix at the junior level?
so no football?
you're a big enough guy.
how did you feel the match went from your point of view? he plays a pretty good game.
why the nerves?
did the fact that you had to wait an extra day, does that prey on your mind a little bit? do you have too much time to think about starting off?
how is the court? is it slower than last year?
how did you cope with the heat out there?
you said before about try being a british player going into a grand slam. is that an added burden for you?
what are your thoughts on hasse?
nice red shirt as well, mix it up a little?
after the second and third set, you go away thinking everything is pretty much working as you want it to?
in canada you were suggesting your preparation hadn't been quite what you wanted, you had heavy legs or something. what's the difference now? have you done something different?
what was it like playing an opponent that is so animated like baghdatis? does that change preparation?
going up against a fellow american, ginepri, in the second, is that more special because you're playing in the us open on american soil?
i have seen a bunch of your matches at the open over the years. this was in my mind the best you've played here. do you agree? is there a reason why?
what did the result in d. c. do for your confidence? did you feel different after that tournament?
do you like that court? what was the atmosphere like out there?
how does it feel to be the first american male to win a match in the main draw on that court?
for years you were kind of the guy to watch. you seem like a late bloomer, like mardy fish. we're finally seeing some results.
what are the main differences in your game from a year ago to now? what are you doing better?
how did that happen? how did you learn to do that?
you played most of your career with head and now you're using the prince without the stencil. why did you choose that racquet, and what's your relationship going forward with them?
did you change strings at all?
what string is that?
is this your favorite tournament?
i think you get stan next, right?
have you played him yet?
do you think that tennis is changing to the extent that we won't be seeing 17, 18, 19 year old grand slam champions? is it almost impossible for somebody that young to win now? if so, why?
you said that you were hoping your light comes on now and everyone matures at different ages. to have that kind of label, the next great young player, put on you at 19, 20 years old, was that burdensome to you? did you feel the weight of that?
do you feel the success of tiger woods in golf put unnecessary pressure on you in this sport? doesn't have a lot of african-american stars.
what's your ranking goal for the rest of the year, and what would you need to do tactically or tactically or physically to reach that goal?
when things didn't go well early in your career with all the hype, was there ever a time like, i'm gonna toss this in? if so, what was plan b?
besides your parents, is anyone coaching you here in particular?
why do you think there are so few americans coming up the ranks right now in a star quality role?
what would you say is the greatest moment of your career and the most painful moment?
you're in here a little earlier than expected. it was kinda quick.
how tired are you at this point in the season, playing so much?
how would you describe how your shoulder felt in cincinnati and how it felt today?
have there been any times this year where you just didn't want to go out on the tennis court, didn't want to get up in the morning and just wanted to...
when you think back on your performance here last year in the finals, do you primarily feel pride of your achievement of getting that far, or is there any disappointment? how do you think back on that?
speaking of entertainment, for years you were trying to pass roger and rafa. in terms of entertainment, rafa is almost like a rock star. he's so appealing. and roger is beautiful and perfect and graceful. how do you think you're taken and received here in north america?
you're no.1. just don't hit me when we're doing an interview.
what do you think your image is like here? how do you think it's changing?
and the maturing process, how critical was that for you for your breakthrough this year? do you put that as the no.1 reason?
do you think that we're past a time in tennis where we're gonna see 17, 18, 19 year old grand slam champions? is it just not possible anymore?
last year jack sock hit with you during the rain and before the final, and now he's out here and he belongs to caa like you do. what do you think of his future and what's to come for him?
roger last night said he felt the conditions were a bit slower. did you feel that too, or do you think that's because he played at night?
to clarify a subject you touched on in the press conference yesterday, what importance has this egg, the hyperbaric chamber had in its therapy for you? how much have you used it in the last year? is there any sort of controversial aspect to it in your mind?
is there something controversial about it, for those of us that aren't that familiar with it?
i don't know if you remember gaston gaudio the argentinian player. he's confirmed today officially that he's a retired player. what do you remember about him? what do you remember about his game?
it's very rare actually that we ever talk to someone who has their dream come. wimbledon, obviously, you became no.1. is it something that actually since you were a little kid you were thinking about it? did it change your life? did it change how people are around you, or were you surprised nothing changed? did you think something like that would really change things for you, or in the end it hasn't changed much?
do you see and read things about people are saying if you win here you might complete the greatest season in the history of men's tennis? does that sound real?
next year the season will get two weeks shorter. do you think that that would be a good length of the season for you, or would you still want the season to...
you'd be happy with that, or still need more time off?
looked comfortable on the scoreboard. was it really that way?
obviously bit of interest at home in possibly a third round against roger. what was your thoughts when you saw the draw?
did you have someone out there scouting him? do you look at the video? how do you attack it now?
you have an unusual style. do you feel players are starting to get more of a read on your style of play?
your hard court season, do you feel like it's heading in the right direction?
you slowed down the first serve. it was really slow.
have you ever had a hit with roger, or ever talked to him or had conversations with him?
what would you like to improve on from today?
how much better are you than you were last time you played cilic months ago? must be an astronomical change to where you have been.
at the risk of asking something obvious, but what happened at wimbledon, what has that done for you going into the next slam?
i have heard you talk in the past about you're still growing and still adjusting all the time. is that an ongoing process, or have you stopped growing yet? what's happening there?
what have you stopped at?
195, 196?
why are you so confident you've stopped growing?
with your weight, are you on like a downward phase or an upward phase?
would you rather play here under lights or daytime? are you enjoying the heat or too hot today?
yeah.
will you share some thoughts on working together with pat? are you impressed? and some background story around how this working relation started with patrick rafter.
so what was it? injury?
lower?
were you feeling it from the start, or did it just sort of come on all of a sudden?
do you think it's travel-related or just do you know where it came from?
second year in a row you've had an injury here. it must be kind of disappointing.
that very long match, what did that mean to you last year, the experience you got here, making that run, having that one match? that was a tough match.
do you think maybe you should've maybe not played winston-salem because it was so close? why did you initially think that was a good tournament?
you had two breaks in the second set, and then you were broken pretty quickly after. was it concentration or what was going on?
are you disappointed that you were out there the first match of the day and the crowd wasn't really there yet, wasn't really into it?
was it the wakeup in the morning didn't feel good, warmup wasn't good?
i didn't see it all, but did your volley let you down?
considering how you performed here last year and the year you've had since, is it a particularly tough performance today?
martina and mats wilander seemed to be saying on tv they thought you were too passive and thought you could be more aggressive. do you agree with that?
you have completed now four major championships for the year. are you satisfied with the year? is it a plus for you? how do you feel about the year?
you talked about the management of your intensity, too much, too little. how did you feel your match was today? your emotions seemed to be pretty frustrated early on in the match.
mary carillo mentioned that you had a talk with billie jean king this year, and that billie jean was really high on and you gave you some good advice. what was that like to talk to her and what did she tell you?
three or four years ago i remember after you lost the second-round match i used the word "journeyman," and you got upset. now four years later you are the american guy here. was there any moment where you said, i'm turning my career around; i have reached rock bottom; this is it?
have you ever come into this tournament feeling as confident as do you right now?
i think you have said, or other people said, you're in the best physical shape of your life at this point. what made you get in such good shape? is it something about the game that demands you be in better shape?
do you think you used to be able to play this game being heavier?
no, i mean less quick, you know, there's a demand on players now that there didn't used to be.
you said it wasn't that bad, but i think last year you said you actually looked at pictures of yourself from then and said to stacey, why didn't you tell me?
what was her reply?
can i ask you a general question, too? venus is going to be playing later tonight without having had any tournaments between wimbledon and now. when you're a veteran, just generally speaking, does your experience playing matches negate not having matches leading up to a grand slam, or is it always important to have matches under your belt?
since they were talking about weight before, i was curious, do you have any dietary tips? what foods have you given up? what foods do you now eat? we could all look healthier.
you said that you were playing with house money. i mean, why do you say that? you don't hear athletes speak that frankly that often.
it seems like then being the top-ranked american here in the us open, it's not gonna be burdensome, any more weight on your shoulders.
you are the top-ranked american here. even with hurricane juggling, they made sure you got to play the first ashe match of this tournament.
just talk about, you know, what it's like to be that guy that the usta is no way gonna put you in grandstand, not the way you're playing now.
were your preparations altered much because of the hurricane?
can you talk a little bit about the atmosphere here and the energy, particularly as the week goes on playing at ashe, playing in new york?
have you ever felt expectations were higher of you in your career?
it's a challenge for you then to channel that into...
as you've gotten fitter, your game is definitely suited for short-term points. how much do you have to guard against maybe letting rallies go on just because you can handle it now, just to sort of show off your fitness?
biggest difference the speed or endurance or both?
i don't know if your superstitious or not, but last time you won the final here you were runner-up at the us open. talk about how this tournament helped you do well at the open.
it's your second title here in cincinnati. talk about winning here again.
how big an issue are injuries and the schedule in tennis now?
when you come out first off and break the the no.1 player in the world, does that change the tone or do you consider yourself that was a lucky break?
does the fact that you won by default take away from winning this tournament at all?
novak mentioned that he had been struggling with the shoulder for ten days or so. has there been any talk in the locker room about his injury, or did that give you any additional confidence going into the match?
when did you realize that he was struggling?
a lot of players have said that it's tougher to win a masters title than a grand slam because you play every day back to back and it's really only top players here. you've won 7 masters titles now. would you agree that it's in some ways tougher than a grand slam?
is there any common theme when you beat novak of things you do well or things he doesn't do well? you've beaten him a couple times.
of the top four, you're the only one really who has come through this week on a nice upward curve. they've all had differing kinds of problems. people will draw conclusions about that for the us open. do you feel this is a good moment to be going into the us open for you, that this is a real chance where other players are perhaps not at their peak?
what's your schedule now? will you be driving to new york?
you guys traded breaks in the first set early on. looked like when you got broke on your serve you were really frustrated and about ready to throw your racquet. how did you got back into the match mentally? you were up a break against the no.1 player in the world and then you kind of...
about ten minutes ago your brother, jamie, tweeted, sometimes you just got to stand up and take it like a man. do you think he was referring to djokovic's retirement?
you tied john isner for the fastest serve of the tournament at 139 miles per hour. you think you've been holding back on your serve previously? is that something that you're looking to...
if the rain had come 60 seconds earlier, would it have impacted your decision?
is there such a thing as a good loss heading into the open?
do you expect this to affect you at all going into the us open?
was it a lot worse today than it had been?
could you describe what was going on with you physically? was it just the shoulder or...
so the pain in the shoulder would more affect the serving and not so much the rallies? you had one 40-shot rally or something.
how long has it been troubling you? has it got gradually worse day by day?
have you had an mri or anything?
apart from your shoulder, talk about the exhaustion you mentioned before, the general fatigue level.
is it too busy, the schedule? back-to-back master's events coming into the us open, i mean, you're not the only player that's got problems at the moment.
have you had to adjust your life in the regard of being world no.1? how has that constrained you? has it added pressure? added fatigue? increased pressures on your schedule?
despite today's loss, it's still a great day for serbian tennis with jelena also in the finals. talk about how you've seen tennis grow in serbia.
second set, you had love-40 a couple times on mardy's serve, and he got back to deuce and won a couple of those. was he doing anything different on his serve in those games where you weren't able to convert?
your moods seemed to change as the second set wore on. you started off almost giggly for you, and then shifted to screaming and your box a lot. is that because the match is getting frustrating?
just fatigue or something more specific?
three years ago you guys met here in the final. does that match give you any tips on how to beat him? i know it was a long time ago, but you played well and beat him here. as you go into the match tomorrow, same game plan? different?
in regards to the tabloid hacking scandal that's unfolding in the u.k., have you ever had cause to wonder whether your cell phone or e-mail had been hacked? as a very public figure back home, what's been your take on that as it's unfolding?
djokovic lost the first set in his quarterfinal and was down a break in the semifinal today before berdych started feeling the injury more. even though he's only lost one match this year, do you feel like this is a good time where he's sort of ripe to be upset this week?
talk about how the shoulder impacted obviously your play today. you were struggling with the right shoulder injury.
what affected your game the most? serve? any particular shot?
midway through the first set you were grabbing your back and wincing a little bit. was there anything in the lower back?
you had a couple long rallies. does that impact it a lot, or you didn't feel it in the volley, it was more serving?
were you close to not playing at all today?
did you come into the tournament with the shoulder problem, or it just happened in the last match?
if there was a third set against roger, do you think you would have been able to play?
you were playing pretty well, up a break on djokovic in the first set. in spite of this, does that make you feel like your game is where it should be?
did novak ask you anything about your injury when you talked at the net?
you're playing hopman cup with petra kvitova. can you comment on that.
does the injury affect your preparation towards the us open? will you take more days off before the open before you start hitting again?
do you know exactly what's wrong with the shoulder? is it a muscle? ligaments?
the blisters on your right hand, were they bothering you a little bit at all during the match today? affecting your ball toss?
do you feel like you got a good amount of play in and practice in going into the us open next couple weeks?
hindsight being 20/20, do you regret playing doubles? being on court for five hours, did it impact your performance today?
(indiscernible.)
can you give us an update on your foot? you had a treatment during the match.
you said mardy was playing well. is there anything in your game that didn't meet your expectations today, other than you lost, i mean reasons why?
will your fingers be healed by new york? will they be better before the us open?
are those the worst blisters you've had on your hand?
before the us open last year you talked about changing your game a lot to try to win the us open, being more aggressive...
seems like when you've had hard court success you've been more aggressive. you haven't hit that many winners here in cincinnati in this match or against verdasco.
mardy mentioned in the first set he was going forehand to your backhand a lot and you changed the rhythm on him in second set. what do you do to change that?
2-all in the second set, you had a first serve called out and the replay showed it was good. you had a discussion with the chair umpire. what did he tell you?
looked look you wanted the point...
what do you have to change specifically to defend your us open title? you mentioned you weren't playing well here and you need to play better. what specifically do you want to do for the open that you didn't do here?
the burns look really bad. was that just a normal plate or a metal thing?
they just put it in your hand?
really?
did you go back it that restaurant again?
there were quite a lot of long rallies in that match. was that a tactic, or is it just the way it the game panned out?
you were coming in behind his second serve quite well, too.
a lot of guys are saying the courts are playing slower, even some of the women are saying it's medium speed. what's your take on the speed of the courts?
there is a trend from cincinnati that you always play during the day. last year we always talked about you played during the day. it was very hot lost year and the year before. are you requesting the day matches or how does that...
andy, tomorrow you could play against mardy fish who is up a set and a break. what you do think about his sudden rise through the game and playing him?
after your semifinal loss at wimbledon to nadal, and i know you've also said it a couple other times since then, you said you needed to improve your game 10% to 15% to be able to beat people like nadal and djokovic and federer. since then, what specific aspects of your game have you worked on to get that additional percentage?
we were talking about your diet before you came in. tell us what the green foods are that you do eat.
has that been tough? are you those things you like?
you're an adidas player. can you elaborate a little bit on the benefit you have from darren cahill gil reyes and maybe even agassi?
i know you obviously compete for a living. i saw something about you competing at some nonmatch time here in like a world search contest. does that go into your regular competitive spirit, things like that?
the world search thing was against two people who english wasn't their first language, right?
oh.
just changing gears, you tweeted some lyrics to a pink song the other day.
are you a huge pink fan?
how were you able to succeed today where you had fallen short six previous times?
you've now held serve 29 games.
that sounds remarkable to us, but how do you frame it?
given how well you've been playing the last year and a half, do you have any regrets or wonder what might have been had you been able to make the same level of commitment eight years ago?
sure.
is 29 the new 19?
can you describe the difference between thinking you can win and knowing you can?
when you broke at 3-2 in the second, what do you tell yourself to not get too far ahead of yourself given the magnitude of the situation, a possible first win against nadal?
what message were you trying to send to the crowd with your gesture afterward?
where does this win rank for you? top 5?
first serve percentage was 53%. is that something you're going to have to improve to beat murray tomorrow?
does the timing of this win change a little bit now that you've been in the top 10 for a little while and finally got the big win?
you said on the television interview that you felt the win cemented your position in the top 10. did you feel a little bit that some people look at it and say, oh, he's had a good run rather than taking you as a top-10 player?
you're at a career high 7 this week. what do you think the key is to be able to stay consistent, to stay in the top 10 for the rest of year and also years to come?
you're a real fan favorite here now. is that something you're aware of during a match like this?
or you're so focused that it's not...
talk about the us open series win that you just completed. what does it mean to you?
how does rafa's day yesterday factor into today? did you want to win the first set more than normal?
you've made it to the final four in masters events several times before in your career, but have yet to win one. is there anything different you have to do to break through, and what would breaking through mean?
you talked about being able to play better on your serve like in key moments. was that the key moment to beating nadal? you won 73% of your service points coming into the game.
tomas, you beat roger for the first time in a while last year in miami. that really seemed to give you and your game a lot of confidence, i believe. can you share a little bit about that miami win and what that did for you going forward?
how is your shoulder feeling? are you optimistic you'll be able to play tomorrow?
were you doing anything on your first serve that confused roger? you won 86% of your first serve points.
you won, i believe it was 75% of roger's second serve points. did you find it was particularly easy for you to read today?
you've won three of the last four meetings with roger. before that you had lost eight previous ones. talk about differences in his game as he's playing you, why you've been more successful recently than you were earlier.
did you think his level has fallen off a little bit or has everyone else caught up?
can you talk about the speed of the courts out there.
talk about your next match. obviously you'll play the winner tonight between djokovic and monfils. djokovic has been winning everything this year. how do you match up against him if that's who you play, or monfils if he's able to pull the upset tonight? what do you have to do to win?
talk about the top 4 in the game. they're fairly consolidated in their positions. how far away do you think you are from becoming part of that where it's not a surprise when you beat someone like that?
you said your first concern is to be 100% healthy for tomorrow. with the us open coming up, if you're not a 100% do you plan on pulling out?
still on the physical side, it looks like you've gained volume in the legs. i remember you working hard in indian wells in the sun. how much did you work on the rest?
you won 25% of your first returns today. is that going to be good enough to be competitive against either player tomorrow? if not, what can you do to improve it?
talk a little bit about your approach coming into the match. you had never beaten him. what were you trying to change, aside from the outcome? any previous match you wanted to improve on?
you seemed to be talking to your player box the entire match. talk about that.
seemed throughout the entire match you were looking over to your player box and talking to your coaches. can you talk about that?
what kind of comparison can we make between this match today and the match in melbourne that was great, too?
even though it was a very close, competitive match the whole way through, a lot of points seemed to be ending on errors rather than winners. does that change your attitude in the match when it's that way?
when you play him, how much is about offense/defense and lefty/lefty, and how much is just mental?
you're one of the players that's mentioned most in the adidas program working in las vegas. talk about that and what you do.
did you enjoy it anyway, this great match?
i heard something about you having a problem with your practice court earlier, and it was with maria sharapova. can you talk about what happened there?
being part of the western & southern long tradition must be still a good feeling to be here on a day like today and support that long tradition here at the open.
yes.
excellent.
how do you recover from matches like this one that were, i'm sure, very physically and mentally challenging?
talk about how you're feeling physically after playing for three hours and 38 minutes as well as doubles.
when mardy fish was in here, who you're playing next, he was asked about playing a long match and then playing doubles. fish said something like, oh, i can't imagine he'll actually play doubles. did you think about pulling out of doubles?
you won today. how did the match leave you feeling about your play?
what was the difference in the match today? there was just a few points here and there. is there anything you can point to technically that enabled you to win?
there were a lot unforced errors on both sides.
you mentioned it was an emotional match. is that because you're playing a fellow spaniard? i know there are a lot of you out there. how much different is it playing a fellow countryman than someone else?
your opponent tomorrow, mardy fish, has had a very good summer and has won a lot matches here and moved up the rankings quickly.
what do you know about him and his style of play?
no, i mean since he's been on a really hot streak recently.
you talked about how novak is a mental challenge for you. for some reason it happens that when players have a new challenge, they struggle with their game against other players as well.
i mean against everybody else because you have a new challenge.
how is your hand after the fingers you burned? any better? any worse?
you know what time to be ready tomorrow. what type of food are you going to be having tonight and tomorrow? you have a time.
you played fernando so many times. i know you respect all your opponents, but how did you guard against overconfidence? you had beaten him 11 straight times.
before today.
i guess you must have watched some of that, did you, andy?
how much will that take out of either of them? either of them really, but the winner really because you might meet him in the semifinal.
were there an unusual number of distractions in your match today in your match on court 3? there were some questionable line calls and a few other things.
had to feel good to turn the tables on him from miami after what happened there.
you won a lot of titles at these masters events in north america on hardcourts. you haven't done as well this year. do you think you're changing your focus away from those tournaments where you've already done well to other things?
with novak and roger and rafa at the top in the rankings and have been so entrenched there, what's it like for you to be on the cusp of that, and how does that affect the men's field because they've been so dominant.
you talked yesterday about getting better day to day. what was better today than it was yesterday?
another player who has been criticized for having better success at other tournaments than slams is caroline wozniacki. today it was announced she split with her father/coach. he said that it was because of criticisms that she wasn't playing the right kind of game with him coaching. have you ever made any sort of changes based on criticism from the outside, or do you try to keep things just in your own...
talk about the depth of the field in the sense that you're two top players, you and richard gasquet, and you're on the grandstand, you can't get the center court match.
you're making this look all too easy. talk about the level of your play right now.
talk about your next round match against nadal in the quarterfinals.
he almost did.
plus he's playing doubles.
does the fact that nadal's playing so much impact your game plan for tomorrow? for instance, will you try and extend the rallies maybe, make him run more?
novak and roger and rafa have won 25 of 26 grand slams since '05 and have had a strong hold on the rankings. what has their dominance done to the game, and how has it affected the rest of the men's field?
did you think it's make the rest of the field better, these three guys?
i believe you're based in california now. can you elaborate a little bit on the change of scenery? has that done anything to your game, helped you relax?
your strong summer has helped you garner the top spot for americans in world ranking. who would you consider to be the strong american in the field going into the open? do you consider yourself there?
as prudent as it was for you to not play at legg mason, to pull out of winston-salem, was it harder to withdraw from those tournaments as an american in the summer series than it would have been if these tournaments were in europe?
after the us open, what's your schedule like?
yeah.
is it just a fact of life for a tennis pro that your self-interests, self-preservation is gonna sometimes collide with the tournament's self-interests?
coming into the us open, you as an american, what would it mean to you personally to have a good showing at that big tournament?
is there any pressure being the highest-ranked american?
because nadal returns so well, does that put additional pressure on your service game?
what do you have to do to do better in that area?
is there anything you're not happy with in your match today?
when you go into a match against one of the top three players, how did you pump yourself up? what kind of attitude do you have to go in with? do you like at this as an opportunity?
that's not what i meant. it's obviously different than playing a player that you're more confident against.
so how do you address that issue?
i think you can win.
given all that's been said about this being good conditions, how much pressure is there on you?
you just clinched the us open series making the quarterfinal here. sam querrey won it a year or two ago and said it felt sort of like winning a title. do you feel like that? sort of a small long-term achievement award?
do you have a preference for when you play tomorrow?
how much difference has a week made in your form, do you feel?
you ever had a match like this with six consecutive break points?
i mean you broke him six times in the match.
how much pressure was there for you going into this match, not only because he's a tricky, tough opponent, but also because if you lose here that takes away momentum going into new york?
what is the key for you in the returning serves well?
some players talk about trying to read body language or whatnot of the server? do you do that, or it's just completely instinctive for you?
what about anticipation in general? not necessarily on the serve, but your peers often say you have very good anticipation. what is that exactly?
is that learned or innate?
i know you talked about your diet change last week; was it a medical diagnosis that prompted the change, or you just wanted to see what it was like?
you've spoken about how you like the us open. is it the atmosphere of the court or the people or the fact that you've had success there before as a junior?
yesterday roger was saying that although there this is obviously strong field, he can't see anyone outside of top four winning it. would you agree with that?
us open, yeah. have you seen a dark horse out there?
speaking of tsonga, he's down a set and a break to bogomolov. do you know him at all?
bogomolov.
talk about how difficult it is to beat a top-10 player versus somebody else on tour?
for you overall, how big in your career is it to get a win over a top-10 player like this?
last year a lot of the guys were saying these are some of the quickest courts they've seen. comment on the speed of the courts here.
you had to qualify to get here. does that give you an advantage? you've played a couple matches already on the courts.
having beaten andy murray already this year, looking back on this game, what do you use and learn from that that you're going to focus on when you come up against him?
it's probably pretty sweet just to be experiencing what you've done this year, career high. is any of this tinged with regret about what you've been through and not getting to this point sooner?
are they here with you?
have you heard from your dad? i know you only hear from him after wins.
talk about the tsonga match specifically. what was the approach coming in? how were you going to attack him?
looked like you were going really deep because he was hitting a lot of errors on both sides of the court, i thought. was that part of it, too?
you head into tomorrow's match with a lot more confidence against andy than you did the previous time coming off the win today?
where is your confidence level?
watching you on the court, you seem to still have your speed. you're 28. do you feel like you've not lost a step?
what do you have to do specifically well in order to have a chance against murray?
what's been your reception from the other americans? you came up with a lot of those guys that kind of stayed at a certain level; you fell down and now you're back up. what's been their reception?
you mentioned qualifying. seems that the same guys always get the wild cards. do you request the wild cards? how does that work?
how much time do you attribute the problems your wrist? how much time do you think that took out of your career?
where was the problem on your wrist?
do you talk to del potro about his wrist issues?
you mentioned the team around you and also the situation of becoming a father. you credit that for some of your success?
focus or?
so you talk about mardy. he's finding his best later - in what would normally be later in someone's career - and you are too. other than two years, what else took you so long to get here?
did you ever think about not sticking it out?
you've had a lot of success recently against roger. can you identify a few things you've picked up in his game that have worked.
in your match with cilic, was there anything that you weren't happy with in your game? you won in straight sets, so...
yeah.
what, in your opinion, are the keys to being an excellent returner of serve, and who do you least like to serve to?
what makes novak so good returning serves?
can you talk about your arm a little bit? how is it feeling for this week?
us open is coming up. what's so special or weird or strange about playing in new york?
what's so different about it? what do you like to do?
you have a trademark celebration dance you do when you win matches. another player who does that is andrea petkovic. she's changed her dance several times in the last year. have you ever thought about introducing new choreography to your celebration?
do you like playing in the combined event at this venue, for instance? obviously this is the first year both men and women are together here. talk about that.
are there any women whose matches you would like to watch?
what do you take away from a really tough loss like this, a very close match?
take us through the point construction: 40-30, 4-5 in the third set. i think it was a key moment of that match where you moved him around a lot and had a variety more so than normal.
i'm talking about the point construction when you were up 40-30, 4-5 in the third set.
you moved him around a lot, more so than usual. was that reactive? planned?
you mentioned you're going to be going home. what's the game plan between now and the open?
okay.
can you just talk about finally getting a win and breaking the 18-match losing streak.
you had a long service game at the beginning of the third set. you saved like four breakpoints in that. he had already gotten angry at the end of the second set. do you think that game decided the match?
when you haven't won an atp-level match in so long and you see you're playing a seed, what does that make you feel?
have you changed anything in your preparations during the time when you haven't been able to win as much?
talk a little bit more about how big of a win this is for you. i mean, first win since march, right? i mean tour level, not a challenger.
you had a very good start to the year with kazakhstan beating czech republic in davis cup, which was considered a pretty big upset. what did that victory mean for you and for kazakhstan tennis?
your sort of streak started shortly after that, not winning. can you point to something that caused the beginning of the losing streak?
can you point to something that happened that caused you to start losing more?
when you won, there wasn't like a big celebration. you just kind of breathed calmly. were you very excited inside when you finally won today?
were you nervous? you double faulted on one of your first match points.
were you very nervous at that moment even though you had a big lead?
the challenger you played was in kazakhstan, did you get any advice or support from the kazakh federation that you were playing for while you were there? what was their reaction to you not playing as well now also?
now that you're winning, do you think you can keep winning at this tournament and beyond?
the crowd seemed to be pulling more for wawrinka wawrinka than you most of the match. do you notice that?
just wondered how you felt about your match, how things went. did you feel like it went pretty much the way you expected it to?
you seem like you've been a lot more consistent this year. what do you think has helped that?
is there anything you changed?
the weather had to be a pleasant surprise considering the way it's been here in the past.
how would you summarize how you played today? good, bad or just awful?
were you tired going into this game? did you feel tired?
what was the main difference today from the match against federer?
you seemed to throw everything at him today. what do you think it will take for either andy murray or rafael nadal to stop djokovic in the final?
yes.
this win takes novak to no.1 in the world rankings. do you now regard him as the best tennis player in the world based on that performance?
you had some incredible points today. which point to you was the most sensational play that you made?
you said the other day that you were dissatisfied with playing around the top 10, that you were improving your game. what are the next steps for you to push your way further up the rankings?
you once said you felt you were made to play big matches at the most important arenas. what happens to you in these big matches? do you feel more free? do you go for your shots more?
at the start of this tournament, many people were talking about the strength of the top four seeds. what for you is the next step, and do you see yourself joining the top four or five players in the world?
you've caught the hearts and minds of the wimbledon crowd here. to what extent do you feel that's helped your game this tournament?
today you were out there against novak; you played roger recently; you've played nadal also. if you had to say, who is the best?
and on hard court?
what is it you enjoy particularly about the grass-court game?
you didn't look very much like the no.2 player in the world today.
zero unforced errors in the second set, two in the third, one in the fourth. how did you manage?
statistics are not important, but you played five finals in wimbledon of the last five tournaments you played here. that is a great statistic. what do you think about that? because only borg, mcenroe and federer have done it.
seventh.
back in 1999 agassi became no.1 in the world and he had to play the final with sampras and he but lost to sampras. the next day agassi was no.1 but sampras was the wimbledon champion. would you like to see the same scenario?
when you walked out of the court you said you were sorry for andy. how do you manage to be so competitive when you're on the court, and as soon as you are off the court you think with your heart about your competitors?
what are your thoughts about playing against novak, and what do you think is the key to the match?
what aspect of novak's game will you find most challenging to overcome?
with novak, do you think you have any advantage, perhaps even on this surface, more than clay against him? and do you think since you've been to this stage of the tournament before and he hasn't, that that might also be an advantage for you?
maybe you're a better player on grass than he is on clay.
you're obviously aware of the magnitude of your achievements. how often do you think of the number 16?
grand slams.
125 this year.
you had issues with your foot earlier in the competition. was that an issue at all today, and will it be in the final on sunday?
this attitude of yours focusing on the competition and the preparation and the health, not so much on the numbers and the results, is that something that's always come that easy to you?
when you speak about not caring about numbers, results, and records, you talk about focusing being on competitive, preparation. is it an attitude that's always been like that for you?
there are many statistics in the game. which ones to you are the most important?
majors won, weeks at no.1, davis cup.
your head-to-heads against your opponents, is that important?
having your family, your mother, father, sister, does it help you to relax or does it change the focus in any way?
how would you describe novak's ability to defend, his movements around the court compared to some other players you've played against? is he among the best, the quickest or...
a lot of the commentators are talking about that forehand that you missed in the fourth game of the second set as being the turning point. is that how you see it in your mind?
are you proud of what you've done over the last fortnight, andy?
looked like you moved back a little from the baseline after the first set.
is this one harder to take because you were ahead?
a couple of times you clutched your hip, your stomach, grimaced. did it play any part today? were you feeling it at all?
do you feel you threw it away today, andy?
can you put into words what makes it so difficult playing against rafa, especially on grass, and the pressure you're constantly under?
what did you think of the crowd support?
could you talk about what it's like to get so far on these big stages and just not be able to push it through to the end?
do you ever cry?
there's been a lot of chat from the nadal camp about his injury problems. there was no evidence of that today. mardy fish didn't see any in the previous round. did you think nadal was injured?
tactically it was going great for you first set and a bit. is there any other way you could have done it?
does it get easier or more difficult to handle, getting to this stage?
you're saying you're going to take a few days, you generally can recover from something like this quite quickly. can you explain what you'll do over the next coming days and what you can learn from today?
will you try to go to the fight tomorrow or will you just watch it on the box?
what one stroke do you think you could improve?
you and rafa have spoken about your friendship. does it take even a slight edge off the fact that you've lost to a friend?
what are your thoughts on novak rising to no.1?
will you think about your coaching situation?
who do you think will win the final?
you said you need to work harder. do you feel like maybe you don't work hard enough?
so what do you exactly mean when you say you feel you should work harder?
how does it feel to be in the final?
is this the proudest day of your career in terms of the combined thing with being no.1?
when you're playing in the era of roger federer and rafael nadal, how would you describe the difficulty in becoming no.1 and what that signifies to you?
for no.1 to mean something, do you have to win the final on sunday to really make it count?
have you ever kissed the turf like that before?
how worried were you after losing the third set knowing that tsonga came back before being two sets down?
did you realize how the people in your box celebrated once you were the winner?
it's been reported that you had dreams as a boy of being no.1. can you share with us was that at practice sessions in the morning? what were those dreams?
did you ever have doubts, maybe roger and rafa were too good, too many injuries, maybe i won't make it?
from your comments a few moments ago, it sounds like this trophy is the one right now in your career you want to hold more than any other.
is that because it's in europe, the grass, the prestige?
jo said you played unbelievable today, especially on the defense. was it your best performance from the beginning of the tournament?
when you fell to your back at the end of the match, were you thinking to yourself, i'm in the wimbledon final or, i'm the world no.1?
what percentage you assign to winning the davis cup to this moment, the importance?
can we say that the season you are having in part is because of this result winning the davis cup?
is it fair to say that after the incredible start you had to the year, you struggled with your confidence a little bit in this tournament at certain stages?
what words did you share with jo at the net there?
the biggest improvement in your game seems to be on the serve since last year. was that the missing link that brought you this success?
some analysts have said that even your slamming of the racquet on the court has improved. you did a really good job the other day.
on a serious note, does that sometimes feel good to vent, let it all out?
we don't know who your opponent will be next of course. if you could, take each one separately and discuss the potential matchups starting perhaps with rafa.
the finals in australia would have hurt him, wouldn't it? i think he's admitted how much that hurt him.
is it true that the first grand slam is the hardest one to win?
but you and andy are of a similar age. have you grown in stature as a player since you won your first grand slam?
did you have a sudden flash of inspiration out there?
even at two sets down?
before today federer had never lost from two sets up in a grand slam. what gave you the belief that you could be the one to end that record?
your serve was almost unplayable. you never gave him a breakpoint.
you were very tough closing out the match, which is not an easy thing to do against roger federer at wimbledon. was it difficult not to become nervous?
were you surprised how roger didn't come back at you when you started to win? a player like yourself or murray or djokovic have a lot of aggression and show it on court, while federer is super cool. it's almost because he was so super cool, that's why he didn't react and ended up losing.
you're known for your creativity, your spontaneity, yet you just now said you need to stay quiet. talk about the mix between the creativity, the spontaneity, and being quiet.
that prime feeling you felt today, what was the feeling you had inside today?
you've had great moments in your career. is this one more special than any one?
you were talking about being scared. do you think you scared roger federer when you started to come back at him, and the way you did?
federer used to be unbeatable on grass. have you finished the legend of 'federer the invincible'?
can you describe what the matchup is like for you against djokovic and what your different styles of play are?
how different are your personalities? in what ways?
did you feel you had this match coming in you? was there anything about this week where you were thinking this is your time or you have a chance? what were the major reasons? you spoke about mentally changing some things in your game. what did you change?
did you work with a psychologist or anything, sports psychologist?
was there any point during the match today that you thought, i'm going home tonight, i'm going to lose?
can you win wimbledon from here now?
how will you come back after this incredible victory and have your focus and determination against novak?
will you tell us about the people around you. i think i saw your brother in the box. how much has it meant to you to have those people around?
enzo, what is he like as a spectator?
where did that inspiration come from?
where did it come from today?
have you ever met mohammed ali? if not, would you like to do that?
what would that mean?
it looked like your foot was fine. can you talk about how that felt today.
it's hurting you?
during the match.
you said after del potro that you were worried. is that still the case now, that you are worried about your foot holding up for the rest of the tournament?
now that you're not worried about the injury, you played freely today for the most part.
moving on through the tournament, you can play your game without the worry?
so today you feel like you played pretty well overall, very good at times?
what were your reactions to the federer loss today?
your recent matches with andy have been semifinals and you have won them. what mental edge does that give you going into this one?
is andy a better player this year than he was at this time last year?
both your wimbledon matches you've won in straight sets against andy. is that a surprise? what difficult challenge will you expect from andy?
you mentioned the two of you have been able to become good friends off the court. i wonder how often you saw him off the court and what kind of things you did together?
did you meet the golfer rory mcilroy when he was here?
did you get invited to play golf with him?
mardy fish did not have a fantastic serving day today. could you speak about what he did that was a challenge for you. talk about how you thought mardy played.
the final.
yes.
2004 estoril, before you became a big, big player, could you talk about what the foot injury was there.
what was the foot injury?
so that's what it felt like two days ago?
for a quarterfinal, couldn't have gotten any better, could it?
there were four teenagers who were so keen on seeing you play, they waited in queue for three days. what do you make of that?
your injury in the third set, what did you do? do you know more about it in the last hour?
out of the four semifinalists you were the only one who didn't lose a set. are you surprised about what happened in the other matches, especially federer's defeat?
when you look at playing rafa on friday, what do you think has changed from a year ago that gives you hope that you can improve on what you did last year against him?
you've kept the beard after saying you weren't superstitious on monday. do you think we'll see it on friday?
it was painful on monday, though.
yes. you said it got to that stage.
so we could see it friday?
can you describe what it would mean to you as a british man to win wimbledon if you got to that point?
did (indiscernible) enjoy the experience of watching you today?
this is your third consecutive semifinal. does it get easier to deal with, sort of the hype around it?
back in march, would you have backed yourself to win queen's and be in the wimbledon semifinal?
if you had to pick a surface to play nadal, which one would you pick? i guess not a clay court. between grass and hard court. a few minutes ago nadal said grass is his second favorite surface after clay with the results he's got.
in that same press conference, rafa disclosed a growing friendship between you two. you see each other a little bit more off the court. but he said that he consistently beats you at playstation. i was wondering what your thoughts on that are.
who is your partner?
do you think this is part of the way he messes with your mind?
can't you play him at singles?
yes. is that not possible?
you thrash him at playstation singles then?
which players do you use on playstation tennis?
just football?
will you look back at matches against rafa tomorrow? and if so, which particular matches will you look back to see? ones where you played particularly well?
obviously you've practiced with feliciano lpez in the past. any chance of you practicing with him?
is there a person, place, or thing that you would queue for three days to see?
coming into this particular semifinal, mentally do you feel in as good a place as you've been with the way you're playing, the confidence you have, the way you're in control?
obviously a bit of banter between feli, your mom, and you. i wonder whether your mom was embarrassed by it or whether she thinks it's quite good fun.
did jamie feel the same way?
your progress so far has been fairly straightforward. would you prefer that going into a semifinal? would you have preferred being tested in some longer matches?
were you feeling the effects of your last match today?
how much can you enjoy a match like that?
is that the best andy's ever played against you?
where do you think he's improved from a couple of years ago?
how do you think it will go between him and rafa in the semifinal?
do you think rafa is the favorite for that, or do you think it's quite equal between them?
if you'd started like you began playing in the third set, do you think you'd have beaten him?
what was going on with the serve? first serve was around 50%.
what do you take away from this?
fans are always comparing roger and rafa. on a neutral court, both players playing at their peak, who do you think is a better tennis player?
when they're both at their peaks.
you're hitting your stride here at an age when a lot of guys are starting to wind it down. is there a feeling of, i wonder if i'll be at this stage here again?
did nadal seem to be slowed at all or have any trouble with his left foot, which he had hurt in the prior match?
what was that like for you between matches? there was so much speculation about was he going to play, how hurt is he. you're the person that's most going to be affected by whatever.
so how do you see the semifinals playing out?
if rafa were to go all the way, would that be a small consolation to you?
tennis is a game of perspective. two, three years ago, you're told that you're going to be reach the wimbledon quarters, you'd be pumped. now you're saying, sorry the pun, i didn't get the big fish. talk about how your perspective has changed, and is that a good thing?
what about davis cup, leading the american team, how does that feel?
what about wimbledon translates well to your game? what about your game works well on this surface? are those qualities of wimbledon that are kind of distinct from other surfaces, are they getting more pronounced or more similar to hard court?
you've played all these guys now, berdych included. when you think about what sort of defines rafa and what makes him different from everybody else really that you've played in the past and what defines him as a champion, what do you think that really is?
yes. just playing him.
there was one point you were in control. rafa runs down and hits a running forehand that hits the t out of nowhere. your hat kind of goes askew.
yeah. talk about his powers of retrieval, his defense to offense, and compare it to novak, who is pretty darn good, too.
he really seemed to lift his game after getting into the match a little bit. he almost like slammed the door on you and you couldn't quite get it open again. is that accurate?
what would you say went wrong and what went right for you today?
was his speed a strong factor in getting balls?
giving up that early break in the fifth, were you discouraged? did you feel he sort of has you out of it? what was your psychological state?
you've been invincible in matches in majors when you've had a two-sets-to-nothing lead. how would you describe what turned things around from the first two sets here?
whenever you come after a defeat in a slam, after five minutes you are in the press room. is it because you just want to get rid of everything and go away and forget about everything or not?
how long will it take you to get over this?
in australia you did say, let's wait six months and we'll see then. now you just came off the court obviously, but if you could reflect on your place in the game, what would you say?
you can still lift grand slam trophies with some ease?
is there any special significance for you in any way, either the pete sampras record or your record? was it sort of like a routine grand slam event for you, or was there any special meaning to it this year for you?
does it feel like the end of an era, because we're so used to seeing you win here?
your record speaks for yourself, but in the fifth set there is something strange. you played 29 matches and you won 16 and you lost 13 today. just a little bit more than 50%. how do you explain it? a player like you, you're effortless, so you should win more in the fifth set than the others. how do you explain the record is not that great?
were you okay out there today? seemed to be breathing a bit heavy.
when you lost after the second set, also you were down 3-1 in the third. how worried were you? were you more angry with yourself? worried? perplexed?
you didn't tell me exactly what was going through your mind. you were still down 3-1 in the third. were you worried?
you practiced with him a lot so you knew his game. were you surprised he was able to produce that level of tennis in a match like that, on that stage, against you, et cetera?
does federer's loss change perspective for you? you lost only to him this year.
did you get to see the end of that match? if so, what were your thoughts as that was taking place?
what are your thoughts about his style of game versus yours? when you look at him across the net, what goes through your mind about his style of play?
sounds like you're lacking a little bit of confidence in your own game. why is that?
you've had an amazing year. do you feel your game is back to where it was in that incredible run before paris? perhaps, if not, do you take confidence in the fact you got to the semifinal of a grand slam without playing your best?
do you think you have more to come? do you think you can play better?
what do you make of bernard's performance considering he's a guy still 12, maybe 18 months, away from his body being mature?
do you think he can be successful on other surfaces?
you say you have some things to work on. is it mostly the touch and the strokes, or is it just to get along better on the grass?
you say you were not feeling well today, that you weren't moving well. what was wrong?
there's always a lot of talk throughout the year about the top four players being expected to progress, particularly at the slams. does a result like roger federer's today show how fine the margins are at the top of the game?
what is the biggest challenge for you on grass? is it that you don't like the low bounces? the movement is so much different than hard courts because you can't plant? talk a little bit about that.
i think you're a match away now from world no.1. does that even matter when you're in the middle of a grand slam? is the focus on winning the title rather than...
how are you feeling right now? are you surprised to have got this far? did you know you were playing this well?
can you contrast your feelings compared with the win on saturday to how you feel right now?
can you tell us a little bit more about why this is happening here and why now?
what was it that led to that change? how did you make the decision to relax and enjoy yourself?
there was a stat saying that you're the youngest men's quarterfinalist here since 1986. how do you feel about being in that sort of history?
for those of us who don't know much about you, it says you were born in stuttgart of bosnian-croatian parents. what has your journey been to get to this point?
can you reflect on the role your father has played and where you got to today?
you probably didn't expect to be in the quarters, given you were a couple points away of going out of qualifying. has there been a scrambling for booking hotel rooms and stuff like that?
have you got somewhere to stay until the end of the week? have you not thought that far ahead?
when you say 'anything can happen,' what about novak? tell us your thoughts about that match and your relationship with him.
how did that happen? did he approach you at a tournament somewhere, wanted to play with you? how did that come about?
australia has a great tennis tradition, but it's gone downhill. are you going to bring it back?
correct me if i'm wrong, but i watched one of novak's interviews during wimbledon. he said he was hitting the ball with you before the tournament. how much will that help you in the following match? and what language do you speak with novak?
what language do you speak with novak?
there's plenty of aussies in this part of london. they gravitate towards wimbledon. how have the aussie fans taken to you? are they ready to accept you with your background being european?
how about lleyton hewitt? has he been any help to you?
yes. has he spoken to you as you've progressed?
you play such an unusual style. if novak wins, he's going to know your game as well as anybody, isn't he?
what about llodra, if he wins, that matchup?
which were the players you looked up to when you were growing up? was it a croatian or australian?
we have an image of australian teenagers being on the beach, enjoying themselves. you had to make sacrifices to be here. or do you still go to the beach and barbecues?
are you playing against china?
are you playing?
have you got any superstitions here at wimbledon, anything you're going to keep doing till you're out?
can't that be a bit embarrassing if it's occupied?
and did you beat djokovic at kooyong?
you obviously know his game. but you beat him in the exhibition.
can you imagine yourself winning this thing?
it's just djokovic, federer, nadal, an easy run.
in previous matches obviously it seemed much tougher. today you were very assertive. looked pretty straightforward in the end.
were you struggling to get a read on it at the start?
how did you find the heat out there?
after three matches, what's pleasing you most about your game and what's pleasing you the least about your game?
the third set, the way you played, that's what you need to go all the way?
what was it like playing in front of the royal couple? do you feel any extra pressure when you have such high-profile guests in the crowd?
you had the wherewithal to make a bow.
it came across as very funny. william and kate laughed; you smiled. it was an amusing thing. was it something you planned before?
did you get to meet them afterwards?
what did they say to you?
any superstition behind your not shaving?
do you have any actual superstitions that you do before a match?
you used to?
given the unreliability of royal arrivals here, do you think you should shave every match just in case they turn up?
until you're brave enough?
is that a cry for a gillette sponsorship deal?
if you have to play deliciano next, do you think your mum would be bared from the box?
what do you have to do to win the tournament in terms of improving your game from here now?
is this the most comfortable you've felt? at this stage, you seem quite relaxed.
how was the heat?
when was the last time you wore a cap on centre, andy?
you may not want to answer this, but if rafa and roger were to meet each other on a neutral surface, slow hard court, both at the peak of their games, who do you think is a better player?
just a better matchup?
talking about the next two opponents, your mum's coaching notes on lpez probably won't be of much use, but what is your own view of feliciano as an opponent, and also what you know of kubot?
does it add pressure when you face somebody you weren't expecting to face at this stage of a grand slam?
what are you going to do this evening?
is this the best you've ever felt here in terms of your tennis?
rory mcilroy is coming today or tomorrow. if he shows up, are you going to try to meet him?
could you just talk about how hard it was to solve his serve today.
so you felt as if he was just playing freely, as if he had nothing at all to lose?
with the atmosphere there, did you at times feel as if you were back at the australian open and not wimbledon?
can you just talk about the atmosphere. that's a hard court atmosphere-wise anyway.
is he playing with, i guess, almost a youthful sort of freedom at times?
how far do you think he can go, and what sort of caliber player do you think he can really trouble at this tournament?
he plays later.
were you complaining about your string tension in that match?
so they were actually delivering you racquets during the match?
do you feel like this is a harder loss to take because it feels like a real opportunity that maybe you gave away?
you must be absolutely delighted with that fight back.
where did you dig it out from?
is it your best ever comeback, do you think?
how do you see playing andy murray at his home slam?
are you aware of what andy murray's mother has been tweeting about you? she's been calling you deliciano.
you've known them for many years?
a question about your coach. why did you decide to call alberto two months ago to become at your coach?
did you change something in your game or in your mind?
he was not on the tour. he didn't coach any player for 10 years.
do you think your four-hour match will have taken a lot of energy out of you? will you have enough time to recover?
what do you think murray's strengths are?
what is it about grass that suits your game? is it being here at wimbledon?
is andy more beatable on grass than other surfaces?
do you fear him at all in the context of a grand slam quarterfinal? have you any reason to fear playing him on wednesday?
you haven't beaten him yet in your career. with your new coach, do you have a different mentality now? do you think you're maybe mentally stronger to take on andy maybe?
when was the last time you practiced with andy and will you speak with him before the match?
do you think judy will talk to you if you beat andy?
at the end of the match, you seemed to be giving everything away: racquet, towels. the crowd really lifted you or were they already on your side?
first time you dropped a set this tournament. is it a sign that the games are getting harder as you go through?
i heard on the tv saying you weren't used to no.1 court yesterday.
do you have a preference among them?
i could imagine what you think. i just need you to say it.
court 1 is so much more modern.
he's by no means your imminent concern, but bernard tomic, have you seen his form? how do you think he'll go against novak?
do you welcome the australians having a tennis player for a change after their great heritage?
he's around, but fragile.
you could say your take-away comment from melbourne is, let's wait six months and see where things are at. now as you're advancing here, what are your thoughts? do you think your comment is pretty justified?
do you try to stay calm and within yourself?
what is your assessment on tsonga's game?
you mentioned lleyton. after his loss the other day he approached his children and they started squealing, daddy, daddy. it was sort of a situation that sort of made your heart melt. what is it like to go back to your kids and you're just daddy to them?
if one of your children should say to you, i want to be a tennis player, you will be happy?
would you be happy?
that was fairly impressive.
what do you think about the schedule, the way you've been put on court 1 a couple of times? potentially world no.1 at the end of this week, you should be on centre court from now on in?
how would you describe the relationship you have with your next opponent and how well you know his game?
how did he first come to your attention? how did you know about this young kid?
you first asked him to hit with you?
the exhibition match january of last year in melbourne, what do you remember about that?
he said that when you had a knockup last week you played a couple of sets and you destroyed him. is that quite right?
if you put roger and rafa in the big picture on a sort of a neutral surface, slow hard court, having them both playing at their peaks, who do you think would be better?
there have been press reports about pierre and his status as to whether he might still be able to join you here. have you had any updates on that?
no way this time?
when you speak of the level of the top four guys, how would you describe the level of play that the four of you are at, how formidable as a foursome you guys are right now?
will you play davis cup in sweden? and what do you think about robin soderling's decision not to play?
do you think with the four of you playing as you are at the moment that we've entered a golden era where truly great individuals are reaching their peak together and contesting for the big prizes?
the quality of the four seems to be head and shoulders above the rest of the others. is it potentially something that people will look back as a golden era of tennis?
you grew up watching pete. how would you compare the three or four of you now with his generation with andre, courier, chang, possibly becker and edberg?
what is your particular superstitions or do you not have any?
were you surprised to beat him? did you expect to beat him? how do you feel about it?
in terms of your career, how would you describe your win?
can you believe that you're in the second week of wimbledon?
you really won the crowd over out there. did that help you? how does it feel?
as the win got closer, did it become harder to close it out in your head?
when did you first realize that he wasn't feeling a hundred percent out there?
there's no more dangerous animal than a wounded animal. tricky one to combat, isn't it?
how far can you go?
what did your dad say when you came off the court?
did you speak to pat?
you're the first 18-year-old for 21 years to reach the fourth round. what does something like that mean to you?
you come from a country that probably has as rich a tennis heritage as any in the world. before you've had a good run here, things were looking pretty down in aussie tennis. talk about that and what you hope to give back to it.
did you have any narrow squeaks in the qualifying event?
really?
was that on one of the backcourts at roehampton?
playing side-by-side with balls flying all over the place. you have to concentrate to get through that championship.
who was that against?
do you play better the bigger the stage?
hard to go from a big court to a smaller court.
you played nadal in melbourne. did this experience help you today?
when the games were falling to you in the first set, 3-love, 4-love, 5-love, what were you thinking at that stage? were you thinking, is this really happening?
you played malisse last year in queen's. what do you recall of that game?
all those many years ago when you were a kid and you first took an interest in tennis, who was your favorite player? was there anyone you sort of wanted to emulate or pattern your game after?
was lleyton able to give you advice for today's match?
after this win today, do you still think you'll be the underdog for the next round?
how important is your serve going to be against malisse?
what went wrong for you out there today?
can you tell us what was wrong with you? you were feeling sick?
do you think having been through a five-setter beforehand was the cause or was it something else?
did he take you by surprise, particularly in the first set?
will this change anything regarding davis cup?
you will not play?
did you wake up feeling not well, or was it only when you got on the court?
did they give you salt tablets or anything during the game?
are you aware that some other players are feeling the same?
he's obviously one of these next-generation players we hear about. do you feel there's a top-10 game there? were you impressed?
is he the best 18-year-old you've played?
you've normally played on centre court. how did you find court no.1? a little slippery today?
how did it feel different from centre court?
did you hurt your leg last night just before the rain came?
it's the muscle rather than the knee?
are there any ways in which being a lefty is an advantage on grass? today you played a fellow lefty, but...
what was the challenge today playing against a fellow lefty?
what is the challenge of facing juan martin del potro?
what specifically about his game is so difficult?
today's top players have it all: size, power, defense to offense, great on all surfaces. you might not want to answer this. but fans love to imagine how the top players of this era would match up against the great players of the past, like pete with his serve or andre with his baseline.
and the players do really well on all surfaces today?
a couple of champions - john mcenroe and jimmy connors - said recently the rivalries today are too nice, too friendly, like between you and roger or djokovic. what do you think of that?
is this the strongest wimbledon field you've faced, the strength of the top four? can you remember a stronger wimbledon field than this at the top?
the spanish under 21 start playing in the final tonight of the euro championships. are you going to watch and do you have a message for them?
i'm not sure. i think 8:00 our time.
do you remember watching when roger beat sampras here, and what do you remember about it?
what players excite you in under 21s?
in the next rounds you've got bernard tomic. you played him before. what do you remember of his game?
when you say doesn't do too much, you mean he doesn't go for winners all the time?
is he more dangerous because he's got nothing to lose really as an 18 year old?
you might have been expecting to play soderling, i guess. does it change your approach to the next round that it's not?
what happened from your point of view, please?
yeah, the latter; maybe they're connected. you tell me.
everything?
did you think about calling the trainer?
how did your opponent take it?
have you been battling with those injuries during the year?
how does it feel to be the last american male standing?
someone suggested that last year you looked at the draw and it seemed so favorable for you that maybe you in essence psyched yourself out. could you address that in retrospect?
today matches are delayed, you get put on court 14. you drop the second set. how do you make sure it doesn't get out of control?
do you worry about which court you play? serena, obviously defending champion, was distressed because of court 2. does it matter to you?
do you feel you are maximizing your talent at this stage of your career?
was there a moment, looking back, that's clear to you now when you really felt strongly that you weren't maximizing things, you really had to change something?
in what ways do you benefit going home and being home between the french and here?
a number of americans have had their best success earlier in their career, courier, chang, andy. you're coming on now. you had the good summer, the colombia success, top 10. how is it feeling now? are you saying to yourself, well done? is there a certain satisfaction?
was it a matter of sort of not really understanding full picture the impact or the meaning? was it a matter of youth or that you were so talented that it came easily?
and you were close to andy, too, who was kicking butt.
when you and stacey are out in los angeles, which one of you gets recognized more when you're out together?
is that part of what you enjoy about being willing to make that plane ride back and forth?
what kind of dog?
this is the first time you've gone into the second week here.
looking at that match, i know he's very good, reached the final last year, big server, but opportunity for you. it's not rafa. it's not roger.
you're going to get some pretty decent prize money. what are you going to get your dog to celebrate?
when you were growing up, did you ever think you'd actually hire a dog sitter to stay at your house?
talk about the match today. did you have any idea robin was in distress? there seemed to be so much talking going on between him and the chair, you and the chair, him to himself.
is that when robin turned around?
is that something that as a younger player would have shaken you up?
what was brad yelling?
would you say you have been really tested since you arrived at wimbledon?
were you worried at any stage?
what is there in your grass court arsenal that you've yet to use this week?
you've not dropped a set yet.
when you were in the middle of your five titles on the trot, i can remember you talking about the feeling of coming here, feeling like you owned the place, like it was your court. does it still feel like that?
do you feel you have a gear or two to shift through still next week?
you may be tired of answering this question, but fans are really interested in comparing the generations. rafa just said that he felt of the current generation, the top four were more solid, they did better both at reaching the finals at slams and the masters, the smaller tournaments, that they did really well on all surfaces. could you take that a little further and compare maybe the play of your generation compared to the andre and pete generation?
what are you going to do on your day off tomorrow?
how do you relax? rafa said he's playing playstation and stuff like that.
talk a bit about the new generation of guys coming, the 21 and under set, tomic, dimitrov, raonic. who has impressed you maybe and why?
after years of it seems like you've been winning everything, it's now 18 months not winning a grand slam, how much have you missed holding one of those trophies?
you're as hungry as ever to do it again?
the under 21s are playing tonight.
that's got to be about the best match of the tournament so far from a spectator's point of view. what is it about you and marcos when you get together at wimbledon?
you seemed to be able to dig very deep at the early part of the third set there. seemed like your energy levels had come up.
what was the atmosphere like to be in?
what will you do differently, if anything, to prepare for facing a lefty on monday?
there was a time in the second set when frustration got the better of you when you smashed your racquet. was that a sign of frustration or...
in a way do you think it helped you because you got your frustration out and put it behind you?
do you do anything besides relax tomorrow? do anything for fun? go to a movie?
what sort of challenges will michael bring to you on monday?
so will you call john mcenroe, see if he wants to practice with you?
have you played with him before?
when you talk about michael's serving, is it the slice serve on the ad court that's tricky?
you got through the first week, and now you're heading into the second week. all the big guys are still there. looks like it's going to be a lot to look forward to.
back to the racquet thing again.
it did show your aggression and your passion for the game as well. is that something you want to keep going, or will you rein that in next week and not lash out like that?
did it go on the first one, or did it take three?
unknown territory?
surprised yourself by getting there after where you were?
what advice did you get overnight that maybe helped you today?
looks like this win today will make you australian's sort of highest-ranked singles. how do you feel about that situation?
what do you think about your next test then? you will play soderling, and you never played him before.
did you see any of his match against lleyton?
have you talked to tony or lleyton about it?
you've been to the third round of a grand slam. what have you learned from your previous third round experiences?
how do you like playing hitters like soderling with such a powerful game?
who has been the most powerful hitter you've played you during your career, do you think?
what family do you have here?
are you in a hotel or are you staying at a house?
how do you feel physically now? he's got an extra day of rest.
pat was sitting next to your dad, and some of the other boys were watching on. how important is that structure to you now, sort of all that davis cup structure?
your dad is obviously perfectly comfortable with you going to others for advice these days?
what are you planning today tonight?
is there anyone you're going to ask to warm you up, any big hitters?
you saw soderling's game with lleyton and you were impressed by his big serve. did you see any weaknesses that lleyton did good that he had problems with?
will you be trying to really test robin's patience? he's known for finishing points off pretty quickly.
how tough is it when a guy plays as good grass court tennis as he did out there today?
do you feel like feliciano's serving is in the top five of the tour right now or top three?
last time you played, he fired 35 aces. you still won. today you lost. he didn't fire as many aces. it was just the passing shots or the level of consistency he had?
how are the emotions different for you as you get older in your career at these opportunities when they disappear, even if it's when another player just picks up his game against you?
you say you played well and still lost. does it not make it harder thinking you have to come back next year and play even better to get beyond this?
if you say you played well but still lost today, it's easier to take, does it not make it harder for the future?
you said you lost a couple years ago and gave it away.
today you said you played well and still lost.
to know you may have to play even better next year.
as the years go by, do you let thoughts creep in that it might never happen for you here?
i'm quite happy.
my question was, it must be harder as the year goes on to think of this dream of yours.
somebody asked you for an autograph when you were walking off the court, and then you threw the racquet at them.
were the tiebreakers really the problem?
do you have any thoughts about moving forward, the rest of the summer, your plans?
do you think serena had a just cause, stuck out on court 2? what were your reflections on that?
moaning about the fact she gets relegated to court 2.
how do you see your season so far?
do you feel like the davis cup in chile was the highlight so far? where does that fit?
have you finally got that song out of your head yet?
you're my favorite tennis player i've spoken to, no shadow of a doubt.
they said they sent you a cd of their hits.
with royal mail delivering it, you'll get it probably by next year.
how fast will that court be in austin?
ryan harrison said you're an important mentor to him. he talked about some of the advice you give him. what would you want him to take away from the tough match that he had with ferrer, and what example do you try to show him when you've had a tough match and leave on the wrong side?
do you think you're still improving?
talk a little bit about the tie in austin, what that means to you personally.
how much do you watch this when you leave early? will you have a chance to watch?
how you feeling?
tougher than you expected?
did you slightly turn off at the start of the second set?
you said you'd give us a hot-dog shot here at wimbledon when you were at queen's and you did.
got a name for it?
was this better than the last one?
you felt you didn't have any option but to play that shot?
laura and elena lost today. you're the last brit sort of standing yet again. i guess you're used to that?
did you see any of laura's match today?
very encouraging to push somebody like sharapova on a big court like that.
does it feel slightly strange that three matches in you haven't actually played on centre court with the roof open?
how big a bonus is that, to have two days before you play on monday? you're the only one of the top four already through to the second week. rafa has to come back again tomorrow.
gasquet, how do you see that?
where does that match you played against him three years ago rank in your sort of great matches?
(question regarding the relationship with the crowd.)
is gasquet somebody that you maybe would have expected to have done better at the slams?
but clearly somebody who has got the talent to go all the way?
how pleased were you today with the way you reacted to the difficulties that the match presented?
if you get through on monday and lpez keeps winning, i'm curious who you think your mum might be supporting if you meet deliciano?
where does that rank among your best performances in grand slams?
where does it rank in your performances, do you think?
i think you had 57 winners and 7 unforced errors. those stats are almost unbelievable really.
what do you make of the pace of the court, the speed of the court? do you think it lets you play your game pretty well?
why do you think you beat andy so convincingly, given his reputation as such a fighter?
what surprised you about andy's game today?
was his serving like the andy roddick serving that you're used to seeing?
was your record against andy beginning to irritate you, the fact you couldn't beat him?
do you think if today rafa beats gilles on no.1 court, you've beaten a three-time finalist here, do you think in spain there will be more coverage for rafa's win or for yours?
when you look at your game and you look at rafa's game, your game looks immediately more suited to grass. has rafa's success actually motivated you in the last two or three years to really sort of try?
have you ever served better?
you said rafa has had more success than you here. who has more female fans here, you or him?
why do you say that?
do you realize your nickname here is actually deliciano. what do you say to that nickname?
do you like that nickname?
do you get a lot of attention from female fans when you're walking around?
do you feel like your serve let you down a little bit today?
why do you think that is?
do you leave here thinking maybe if there had been another hour of light last night that you might have done better?
you played matches where it's gone from one day to the next before. that wasn't a new situation. did you come out feeling any more nervous?
you had a couple moments today, but overall how did you feel about how you handled your emotions?
you beat a quality player in the first round; pushed this guy to five sets. must sting to feel you're really close, on the cusp.
your confidence, some would say, is a real strength that you have. over the years, what do you think is the best you could do at this tournament?
by the time of your first match at flushing, what would you like to achieve this summer?
mardy said the other day it would probably be good for you to have clarity in your coaching situation. talk about that.
what sort of role has andy roddick played for you in being a mentor?
he said the other day that up here is right now the biggest challenge for you, figuring out that mental stability formula which you alluded to earlier. how far along do you think you are? what obstacles do you see?
what do you see as the burden, if that's the right word, on your generation of players, given so much talk about how long it's been for u.s. men to win a slam and where are things going, all of that?
you got a long look at soderling and now a long look at david. you got two top 10 guys there in a slam. what sort of things do you think separate those guys from where you're at?
in the way you produce shots, do you feel like you're already there?
people talk about your high tennis iq. do you love getting into the nitty-gritty of all the nuances of this game? does it fill you up day in and day out with intellectual stimulation?
what's the biggest thing you've learned from andy?
what is your plan from here?
how tall are you exactly?
you have reached the last 16. how do you feel your game is going?
can i ask you, do you remember obviously your match with murray here? what are your memories of that match three years ago?
you wanted them to stop because of the light.
do you think they should have stopped?
how much harder do you think it is three years later? how much better is an andy?
do matches like that have a psychological effect on players, or do you have to find a way of putting memories to one side?
what part of his game has improved the most, do you think?
did you week speak after the matches in roland garros and back here? was there any conversation?
as you say, there is a big help for a british player playing here, but there is also a lot pressure, isn't there? can you understand that that pressure can be negative sometimes?
you've run into both nadal and djokovic twice each this year. how would you evaluate them here on grass?
you missed two years here. how much do you enjoy wimbledon?
you're having a good year. are you playing as well now as in 2008 or better?
you're happy on grass as well, aren't you?
do you still have ambitions of winning grand slams yourself?
about your foundation, what do you hope to achieve with that?
but the idea was to use sport to help...
was there ever a point in the match where you thought you were going to lose it?
when you're playing, are you playing for yourself or your family or you country?
do you feel confident for the next couple of rounds?
gonzlez.
how were you feeling at two sets to love down, knowing you had to go into completely new territory if you're going to win the match?
how worried were you in the third set?
did he surprise you how well he played?
when he's in that kind of form, can he still do damage at the majors?
how important was it to serve first on the last three sets?
people talk about the top four in the men's game. do you feel with how good you have played and can play that they should maybe consider a top five as the dominant gang?
obviously your ambition is to break into that four, three, two, as high as you can go?
it's tough, isn't it?
how did you find it playing under the roof?
you played a tremendous match, a tough one. how many times did you think you wouldn't make it to wimbledon with all your injuries?
fitness-wise are you in a position where you're going to have to take a couple of weeks?
how much confidence will you get out of this when you reflect on it?
you won your championship on centre court. is there something special that goes through you playing out there?
was there a moment in the match, maybe an aspect of your game, that let you down that made the difference today?
do you almost feel you let him off the hook, two sets to love up, playing quite well in the beginning of that fifth set? do you feel it's almost the one that got away from you?
where to from now?
does it surprise you how well you were moving, given what happened at eastbourne?
if the medical advice is you don't need any medical treatment immediately, what kind of schedule do you think you'll have?
how big a deal are the olympics for you, next year's tournament here?
obviously you're one of the fan favorites here at wimbledon. you have the very vocal australian supporters behind you. can you sort of explain how that helps you on the court? do you hear them? does that spur you on to better tennis?
most observers would view your career with the medals you've got in the cabinet already and be amazed you have the motivation to still go on. where does that motivation come from?
patrick rafter mentioned a few years after he retired, he felt a little bit -- well, have you chatted with him about that?
the shot that you played to break in the second set for 5-3, where does that stand in the best shots you've played?
your ranking is obviously going to take a knock after this. are you up for qualifying, the hard sort of grind of trying to get back into the main draws?
you're regarded as someone with a very disciplined game. do you see the same qualities in how novak has been playing this year?
good workout for you?
you obviously played very well at the french. are you pleased with how you've continued here?
it's your second match on grass. do you feel you've already made all the adjustments that you want, that you feel at home?
how do you feel about the ceiling?
in paris you mentioned the importance of the mental side of the game. talk about that. is that something you've worked on and improved on?
do you have special mental exercises that you practice?
on the roof, a lot of the other players who played under it said the conditions were slower. did you not feel that was the case?
one thing people do say about the toss a little bit inside is that they're finding issues with the lights. have you noticed anything like that?
you play now against david nalbandian. you've played many times against him. this is not the same nalbandian as years ago. but what do you remember from those moments and what do you expect for the match on saturday?
at the moment, you can play till 11:00 with the roof. do you think it would be fun to be able to play to midnight or beyond?
jimmy connors the other day made kind of a jimmy-connors type point saying he felt the rivalries in this era were soft. can you talk about that.
what does it take to beat you out there?
players on grass take a little while to get used to it. do you notice any jump in your ease or feeling comfortable on the surface this year compared to other years?
can you pinpoint any specific turning point in your mindset that helped you change things around?
you've spoken many times about the respect and admiration you have for roger federer. when you think about his durability, what occurs to you? he now has a streak of just about 12 years without missing playing in a major.
why do you think he's been able to endure in a way that few players ever have in that way?
what do you remember about when he beat sampras here, if you got to see that match?
when are we going to see your younger brothers out here playing?
there were times today when you seemed particularly exuberant, sheer enjoyment of playing and having good moments, particularly when we thought you were going to take flight after that great rally. you celebrated. you do express yourself. are there times when you feel more exhilarated than others on the court? today did you get some particularly good vibrations while you were playing?
i was wondering if you felt particularly, given all the pressure at wimbledon, you seem to be quite exhilarated by it rather than introspective.
the fact you've been so relaxed, you've been making friends with a squirrel.
does she have a name?
a lot of players appreciate wimbledon because they can live in the village with a team. do you live with your team in a house and cook like rafa does for the team?
do you live with your whole team there?
if you had no wimbledon to play, what would you like to do in london, like a tourist or normal person?
what is your secret with your return of serve? do you think this shot can be the key to win the tournament?
talk about how it was out there today.
could you take a moment and talk about the job you think the american media does covering tennis.
is that mostly in terms of is tennis dying, a country club sport?
why do you think it is that people refuse to accept the stats? the wall street journal printed some stats which said that tennis over the past nine years is the only sport to increase participation in america.
720,000 people at the us open.
what does it mean to have your parents here after all these years? their first trip here.
you grew up in south florida with alex bogomolov. he's really struggled. up until this tournament, he's won one match in a grand slam tournament. why do you think maybe he's struggling? why do you think he's coming into his own now?
you had a quick quip the other day for the question about mcenroe suggesting that perhaps the warmups aren't necessary.
has there ever been a circumstance where you've chosen not to do that warmup?
i was wondering if you've ever had anything strange happen in the warmups? in a couple of the women's warmups there have been incidents that have caused great drama.
people being hit by shots, thinking it was done on purpose.
jimmy connors had a comment saying the other day that these days rivalries are getting soft. could you talk about the evolution of rivalries, even going back to connors, mcenroe, borg?
do you agree with marat who say the rules are way too rigid?
i know you like to have a pretty good volume of matches before you come into slams. how do you feel about your volume coming in here?
talk a bit about your serve. made some small adjustments in that.
you've served so well for so many years. was it strange for you to adjust something to that shot?
i remember when you first came out, started doing great, there was a lot of concern about your shoulder because of the way you served, coming from the outside. how much has it been an obsession of yours to keep that healthy?
speaking of your support team, your coach is going to be inducted into a regional hall of fame in about five weeks. what can you say about what he brings to the game?
you talked the other day about being injured, just how frustrating and difficult that can be. is there a tug of war that goes on internally or externally when you know you have sponsor obligations or the public wants to see you? how does that play into just the process of knowing when to come back?
tiger announced he won't be returning to his tournament. what would you give advice to someone like him?
can you sympathize?
you said you played those three-setters. did you do that because you know there's a finite period, you won't be doing this at 60, 70 like journalists?
the expectations here are massive for you to win. you said you don't let that pressure you in any way. do you have any way of blocking it out, by not reading newspapers or just focusing on other things?
how do you think you played?
is there a slight contradiction on your serve at the moment, in that you said you served well, but you're serving at 54%? is it that your second serve is better or the position of the ball is better?
do you wonder when you're in a match like that about how much energy you're expending? as you look to the tournament as a whole, obviously you don't hold back on what you put into it, but do you try and save some energy through the match?
a bit was made about you playing on court 1. does it bother you?
one of the commentators was saying that you were drug tested at 7:00 a.m. last week. is that true?
7:00 a.m. in the morning they came to your house?
what did you think about that?
would you be happy to see scottish players in this british olympic team, the football team, that's been talked about?
are there any other benefits to playing at home, apart from the support from the crowd?
you said you watched scream last night to relax. do you normally watch horror films to relax?
as you progress in the competition, do you find the pressure increasing?
is it quite nice you're not the only brit left in wimbledon? different to last year. how pleased are you for laura and elena?
have you picked a film to relax to before your next match?
do you think wimbledon should keep the big television screen on murray mount when it rains?
what makes ljubicic so dangerous, so difficult to play?
talk about your match, thoughts overall. fairly clean?
when you came into the french, you talked about you just wanted to make that third round, do something better. here it seems like you're more comfortable, more relaxed?
how do you define 'doing well' here?
because of the state of tennis and golf in america, two sports the country dominated for so long, we're always writing about the state of golf and tennis in america. i noticed one of the pro golfers got a little bit distressed about it, saying, why don't you just leave us alone? do you feel the same, that we're harping on the thing too much because there are few americans, both men and women, in tennis?
the whole american philosophy, team sports, individual sports, is, we're no.1, we want to be no.1. the advertisers jump on that. do you think it all fits into part of it, why we sort of look at people who aren't at the top and say, what's the matter?
why do you think individual sports kind of appeal to like your generation and generations before, and now all the kids seem to want to be on a team?
speaking of davis cup, your victory in colombia was pretty incredible. what would you say is the highlight of your career?
alex bogomolov just made it to the third round. how well do you know him?
why?
do you think some players don't understand the size or the smallness of the window of opportunity you really have in sports? you can get to 33, 34, it's shut pretty much.
you've been talking about quarterfinals, referring to australia and the us open. i know the big four are tough here. is semifinals of a major completely out of your head, or is that an overall ambition?
all of us have regrets in our life. if the mardy fish of today could look back to mardy a few years back who was enjoying the pepperoni pizza, what would he say?
when somebody is playing, you're talking about the top four out there, when they face them, do you think the psychology of facing them already gives them an advantage as opposed to just hitting the shots back across the net?
you had this great run post-wimbledon last year. could you previously take us through the sensibility, what it's like to go to newport, the heat of atlanta, the hollywood of l.a.?
the cultures, what it's like for a tennis player.
andy said yesterday that what he likes about harrison is that he competes hard, he wants it, he has a desire, and he doesn't see that from a lot of younger players. do you see that, too?
with the weather being so precarious, how important do you think it is that you're on schedule still?
obviously must be disappointing. what do you think you could have done better to have made an impact on the match?
you obviously got off to a bad start. apart from that you seemed to play well up until you lost the tiebreak. did you feel you were in it, causing him problems?
after the success you had at queen's, did you feel perhaps the extra pressure to perform here?
how good was it to step out on court with the home support?
what's on the menu?
you want to be back next year?
what have you learnt most from queen's and this experience of being here?
on twitter this morning you asked people to be very loud on court no.2. did you feel that home support?
things better than usual here?
serena just talked about how it was such a relief to get out of the first round, that she was thinking to herself, please don't let me lose in the first round.
can you address maybe how much more difficult the first round is than maybe the quarterfinals.
how good did that tiebreak in the second feel?
he came up with a pretty special backhand volley on the first set point. did that make you think, oops, i have to play well here?
talk about your friend serena and what her fighting spirit, what makes her special in this comeback.
is there something a little other worldly about her fire, competitiveness?
do you think it would be possible on the men's circuit? serena, clijsters, they come back after one, two, three years, and they're still competitive.
now you have del potro.
for sportsfans back home, how would you explain or describe the level of attention or scrutiny andy murray is under here these two weeks, and tim henman before him?
you've been here a long time now. at one point you were the bad guy upsetting tim henman.
do you feel you're a popular guy with the locals now?
you got good support today.
do you ever think about your past or you always think about the present and future? i mean, 16-14 in the fifth set is still something that sticks out in your mind or you try to forget?
it still gives you confidence two years after?
do you feel like the last couple years you've had a lot of mini comebacks from injuries?
right now tiger woods is going through injuries. for an athlete, your body is so important. what is it like when you can't play at the level you want to because you're injured?
are you going to stay for the isner/mahut match?
is it kind of surprising that roger federer hasn't really had any kind of injury to take him out?
apart from the top four seeds, is there anybody that catches your eye, predictions, anyone that could make the semis or finals?
apart from yourself and the other top four.
the top four here coming in all playing well, all having proven how well they could play on grass, how would you describe the strength of the top four seeds here?
of all the tournaments you've been in, can you compare the strength at a particular time the top four seeds with this group?
how would you describe the difference in tone and press coverage here of murray and maybe of yourself and other athletes in the u.s.?
you said you feel like you can reach semis and finals. you've been on and off all year with injuries. you feel ball striking-wise, coming off queen's, that your game is in a place where, like you said about serena, if you can get in a couple good matches you can make a decent run?
we heard john mcenroe saying the other day we should get rid of the prematch knock-up. do you find the knock-up is important to you?
yes.
there's some who talk about the role of luck in our sport, draws, health, what generation you're born into. talk about the role of luck in tennis.
can you remember a lucky moment and an unlucky moment?
you spoke earlier about serena williams coming back. when serena and venus are not able to play, how would you describe the void there is on the women's tour?
ryan harrison, you've had a lot of involvement. talk about where you think he is, what you like to see from him in the next seven or eight months.
what are you listening to this fortnight, still the wurzels?
what were your feelings about today's match before, during, and after?
how did last year's match affect your life?
last year you were also very disappointed when you lost. yet it seemed as if you were able to change it into a very positive thing with the book, with everyone giving you such affirmation, telling you how well you did. what changed your view of the match from a disappointment to an achievement?
it seemed at first you were very disappointed. you felt you let people down by losing that match.
yes. but then you saw that there were many positives to be taken out of it. it seems to us that in many ways you look upon it more fondly than john does, who felt sort of like, i don't want to be known as the guy that won this match, i want to be known for more than that.
john said he thought your movement was hampered by your knee. can you talk about that. was it bothering you?
what do you feel about john, both from the experience last year and the year in between and today?
do you want to play with john next year maybe once again in the first round here?
you said john played very well today. can you describe what you saw in john today.
why do you think today was such a different type of match?
from the last time you played.
are you excited about hopefully playing on centre court?
you came here to watch when you were 11?
who did you see?
did you queue or did you have tickets?
is it because of boris and michael that you...
when did you meet him?
did he give you any advice? i know you still had to beat your opponent, but...
for tomorrow.
how will you deal with the pressure of being on centre court with the crowd probably 90% behind andy?
how will you prepare for such a big game? i mean, what will you do? how do you prepare for probably one of the biggest games of your career?
did you listen to music? do you sort of try to switch off from tennis a bit?
what movie will you watch?
what find of movie?
have you been to scotland before?
you have never played with andy, but you have practiced with him, haven't you?
was it hard to practice with him? was that a step up?
for the british public who don't know a lot about you, what do you liked to away from tennis?
were you a big fan of jorg albertz at hamburg?
did you like him?
you bought the shirt or was it actually his?
did you follow him when he was in glasgow?
you like playing cards, is that right?
do you play with other players on the circuit?
andy says in the locker room when it's raining you all sort of can play against each other on the playstation and things like that...
are you living near wimbledon? because there's been a few players that have had to get the tube.
tobias, very few players get a chance to come to a major event as a fan and look at centre court and say, wouldn't it be great if i ever got play on it that? has it struck home yet, or do you think in the coming hours or maybe tomorrow morning it will suddenly strike home to you, christ, i'm on that court?
how can you beat him?
you're going to win?
how do you enjoy being in london. what do you like to do?
what do you do when it's raining like that?
who is your favorite group?
any english groups you like?
he gets you in the zone?
what's been the best moment of your career, would you say, the thing that you're most proud of achieving?
which shot of yours should andy be most worried about?
what's your best shot? maybe that's a better way of asking.
you said you hit with andy in monte-carlo. is he the highest-ranked player you hit with?
is that who you would most like to hit with? is there anyone else?
just to clarify, when you came as an 11 year old, did you have centre court tickets or was it just ground passes?
so you've not set foot onto centre court?
why did you have such is fantastic year? what made a difference and turned you into the atp's most successful rising player?
if you chat with andy beforehand, you can chat about football. he's a big fan.
do you prefer and english team at all, or just hamburg?
did you get to meet michael ballack?
never met him. you would like to?
is there anything that you might have done if you hadn't played tennis? did you ever think about playing football?
andy broke the $16 million barrier last week when he won queen's. can you ever imagine that?
you want to buy a nice sportscar?
what do you drive?
you've still got it?
what are your emotions after all that? are you just glad to have got it behind you and come out with another win?
what do you feel for the man who lost last year's match and lost again today?
david nainkin was out there with you a little bit?
did he just come by to help? sam left, and i know he was working with mardy, too.
and craig?
craig is going to be coaching you when you get back?
dave has been helping you for the last few weeks?
you must know him pretty well because he's been working with sam.
the sequel rarely lives up to the original.
what did you think of the court placement and the atmosphere on the court?
would you prefer to be on another court?
nicolas wrote a book about that match. can you imagine writing about that? did anyone approach you? in many ways, he seemed to gain a lot of positives out of emerging the loser; whereas you seemed burdened by having won the match.
is it safe to say at some point you grew tired or weary of the questions?
what went through your head?
i remember you saying last year coming out after your last to de bakker, even though you enjoyed the experience against nicolas, what you really wanted to do at wimbledon was get into the second week. talk about your feelings going forward.
what do you think you have to achieve for last year's match to maybe be second when people talk about you?
were you able to talk to nicolas after the match?
what did you say to him?
it seems almost every slam, maybe going back to the roddick us open night match, there's a lot of drama around your appearances in slams. can you talk about that?
how would you best describe the feelings you experienced after winning this match versus winning that epic last year?
considering the conditions and also just the expectations, you both had a lot to lose because of what you did last year. how do you feel you handled the whole situation?
first service game you faced a breakpoint. no panic there?
what sort of a mental hurdle was today given the buildup?
we know that nicolas wrote the book. have you had any commercial opportunities or sponsorship opportunities as a result of what happened last year?
what are they? can you tell us about them?
how satisfying was that?
were you surprised how well you moved out there?
did you feel you were in less pain than last week?
can you elaborate more on the journey of the last week or so.
it was proper test of your foot, too?
what's the medical advice on what you should do with your foot if you weren't here playing?
painkillers today?
what will you do before your next match? a lot of physio as well as having a practice hitting?
you won the open 10 years ago. a few days later it's 9/11. do you have recollections of that? were you already flying home? how did that play out for you?
could you take a minute and talk about the role of luck in our sport. there's draws, let cords, injuries, the situations you were born into. talk about the role of luck in tennis and in your career.
can you recall a real lucky moment in your career and a not-so-lucky?
next up it looks like robin soderling. tell us about how that's going to be as a challenge for you with your foot and everything.
a chance you'll get a decent court, is this the sort of match that keeps you going?
you've beaten him before. what have you had to do on those occasions?
much change from last year's first round?
the centre court was thrilled by your performance today. how satisfying was it to you? how far do you feel you got into the tournament in terms of happiness with your game?
you've played almost 50 grand slams consecutively, no retirements in your career, no major injuries. what's the secret? how do you explain that?
you talked in paris about having less pressure. i'm wondering if you feel differently now that you're on this surface, at this tournament, and also your performance in paris? do you feel like some of that has shifted back over to you?
would it mean a lot to you to tie pete, especially because you're working with paul?
you spoke about the longevity of your career. what at this point is the motivation that makes you want to perform and keep on coming back? has that changed?
your game has a great deal of power, but you're also known for how you play with balance. talk about that quality in your game. does that give you a great deal of pleasure playing the game, and has that helped you in terms of injuries?
you spoke about the game slowing down. given that the weather has been typically london, the forecast isn't for one of those really hot summers, does that alter the way the tournament goes for you? does it play into your hands?
i'm thinking of when it's 80 or 90 degrees for two weeks, and the court dries out a lot more.
do you plan to watch the isner/mahut match? do you expect if it goes on after 6:00 it will finish?
are you satisfied with your game today, and is there more to come?
was it tough or...
how does it feel being back at wimbledon after the two-year gap?
did the rain break disrupt you a lot yesterday?
is it fair to say that you looked a bit nervous today?
yes, i think so.
what was your first impression? obviously pretty good if you won.
do you feel the pressure because of that? do you feel people are talking you up too fast, too soon?
how did you like grass?
people are focusing on your serve. can you just talk us through your career? was that a natural shot for you, or was it something you worked particularly hard on?
great shot to have in your armory on grass.
were you thrown off at all by the change of opponent?
do you have to change what you were going to do from the start?
did you find out early in the morning before you went to warmup?
do you remember the last time you were here playing you were on court 14 playing doubles with popisil. do you remember that, and did you think it would take three years for you to get back to that court?
is it hard not to get caught up in the whole thing, you know, the whole being here? you were here before as a junior. but do you get distracted by all the things that are going on, and even playing on that court, all the people walking by, and the noise of the two show courts?
there's been a lot talk about you and rafa meeting in the third round. give us an idea of what that would mean for you to play him here.
if you do play muller, i think he's also a big server and there may not be a whole lot rallies. what do you go in there doing in terms of trying to get a chance to break?
you talked about sampras. did you watch most of his finals?
did you feel like the second set almost got away from you today? he had a breakpoint on that. did his game pick up a bit in the second set?
i was going to say, only 13 unforced errors. you have to feel good about how clean your game was.
were you nervous? where would you put the nerves at?
it helped to start out with three aces.
do you still feel at the moment you can play very free, because, you know, expectations are probably not as high as possibly they might be if you carry on with the progress you've made?
if you do play rafa in the third round, it won't be that you're going in there thinking, i'm just glad to be on centre court?
you had the amazing run at the start of the year. when did the fatigue factor kick in?
because of that, are you looking to maybe adjust? you have a couple tournaments scheduled before the two masters this summer, maybe atlanta and d.c. because of that, what you've learned, do you think you might adjust that a little bit?
who's telling you you should be playing 250s?
you never got to defend your first wimbledon title. you finally got that moment of walking out first on centre court as defending champion. how did it feel?
your final in 2008 against federer is remembered as one of the greatest games ever. but this year there's a lot of talk about the top four seeds all being very equal, murray, djokovic and federer. who do you see as your biggest opponent?
you responded to his breaking your serve in the first set very vigorously. were you surprised that he took that game?
what opportunity did you have yesterday to watch the u.s. open golf, and have you had any communications with rory since he won?
he said he's going to be here next monday. what are your thoughts on him being here and being in the royal box?
in the last eight years you're the only player to win queen's and then go on and win wimbledon. how important do you think it is to get a win on grass before you come here, or is it not that important?
2002, lleyton hewitt.
how nice was it for you to see your mother and father sitting in the royal box in the front row?
you have two free nights before your next match. will you stay in your apartment, or do you think you'll go out in london?
two nights before your next match.
but will you stay in your apartment or go out?
what are your thoughts on your next opponent? you mentioned that's the only match you're thinking about now.
were you confident the storm would blow out with those forehands, because he came at you straight from the first gun, didn't he?
what was it like under the roof?
does it make you feel a little smaller in there with the roof closed?
just talk us through the messages on your kit bag.
did you pick them?
could i ask you about drug testing, because on the tv they said four tests in 27 days, and last thursday, on a rare day off, they knocked you up at 7:00 a.m. it's kind of weird, isn't it?
it was john lloyd, i think.
at 7:00 a.m.?
so were you asleep at the time?
it's a bit harsh, isn't it? surely you can't be happy about that many tests, or is that quite normal?
did you make them a cup of tea when they arrived?
are you sure they're drug testers?
they don't have a card saying...
you talked before your match about trying to stay calm or about controlling your emotions. you seemed to do that really well today.
was it a matter of satisfaction to win the last two sets to love and complete it with a point you completed it with?
how important is that to get into a rhythm? you've been able to play under the roof. you're already into the cycle, aren't you, of a two-week tournament?
are those messages on the bag something you can just look at for a little bit of inspiration?
did you watch the golf last night?
rory obviously came back from such a disappointment in the masters in such spectacular style. is that something you could take inspiration from?
when you're in a situation like when you're trying to be more controlled, do you actually then say, god, i'm really controlled this time; normally i'm swearing? do you go on with yourself at this point, or is it becoming natural to become more controlled?
looks like it might be kamke; he's two sets up at the moment. how much do you know about him? he's somebody who improved a lot last year.
was it a disappointment at all? they turned the big screen off because of the conditions. is that disappointing for you that your fans didn't get to watch it on the screen?
do you feel any more pressure representing and playing for u.s. men, you and andy, considering the dearth of individuals at the top?
do you have any thoughts as to sort of why the drop-off behind you guys at this point? we've been asking this question and talking about this for about a year now.
you've been coming here for a number of years now. your game should fit into the grass. you've had some good grass court results. can you talk about the evolution of your game on grass and what your expectations are this year?
what makes grass your best surface? why does your game fit it well?
can you explain what 'heavy' means to you?
is that frustrating for a guy who likes grass?
do you understand why there seems to be this desire by officialdom to homogenize all the surfaces?
i guess you consider, of the slams where you should be doing well, you consider this the one where you've underachieved the most?
why is that? is it a conditioning thing?
istomin, your next opponent?
what was your reaction when you heard who isner will be playing here? and what are your thoughts about last year and this year?
what do you remember most about last year's match between them?
you're not a short guy, but when you walk around the locker room these days, do you feel like the height of the players...
do you have to be like 6'4" to get those free points these days?
has andy given you any crap about out-ranking him or anything?
how strong would you say the top four seeds are here right now, given the surface, and how each one of those guys are playing?
how intimidating is that to everybody who is in the next group?
you talked about the serve. if you look at the top four guys, roger can serve, murray can hit the big one. isn't it more of a return in baseline games outside of mental that is their strengths all around?
you spoke earlier about the dearth of players or the perceived dearth of top american men players to follow you guys. when the williams sisters are not around, as they weren't the last year or so for the most part on the women's side, how different do you perceive the women's tour without the williams sisters?
did you see venus' outfit today?
that's not the way you would like to end a final, is it?
did you want to carry on playing?
do you think the officials had no choice but to default him?
did you speak to him after it? did you talk to david? did he apologize?
did you think he owed you an apology?
has anything like that ever happened to you before?
did you actually see what happened?
you were putting him under quite a lot of pressure at that point in the match. did you feel his frustration was kind of coming close to the surface?
you alluded yesterday in the press conference the way he sometimes makes things difficult for the opponent, hitting the ball sort of hard in warmups and everything, but does that kind of behavior surprise even you?
he says that it was partly because of the pressure that the atp put on you guys because you play that often. can you sympathize with him in that respect?
is it at all annoying to sort of win a title in that way for you? i mean, you were playing well, you had played well all week.
he suggested there were times this week when he had been asked to play when the conditions were wet and difficult. have you had any complaints about this week about being asked to play in difficult conditions?
have you ever been defaulted or in trouble for a similar incident in your career?
has anything like that happened in a match to you before with an opponent? have you had an opponent defaulted?
did you know the rule?
what are your plans next week?
i guess that was a day where experience counts, because it was tough, tricky with the wind, and a slippery court, was it?
what does it mean to you to reach the final here?
what do you make of marin cilic?
how difficult has it been to play two threeset matches yesterday and then come through in such tough conditions as today?
it must have been tough for you, because you have been hanging around sort of monday and tuesday and waiting to get on on wednesday?
do you think they could have organized it better? because you were supposed to be first on a monday, and then you were like fifth or sixth on the schedule for tuesday and you didn't get on. do you think it could have been handled a little bit better?
that's your first grass court final tomorrow since wimbledon in 2002. does that feel so long ago? i mean, that was 10 years ago.
must have been difficult out there with that wind blowing?
have you played in windier conditions on your travels anywhere, on the seafront somewhere?
i guess all in all, with all the rain and now the wind and everything, it's been a very difficult week, so it must be very satisfying to reach the final.
the fact it's your firstever grass court final might come as a surprise to some people, given your game. why have things never quite clicked on grass for you before?
champions here have often done very well at wimbledon. how much of an advantage do you think you have over people who left earlier in the week who were beaten earlier or injured going into wimbledon as somebody who has perhaps always not had a great run here? do you think that this really is an advantage to staying around to the final?
i'm sure bob wasn't very thrilled with goran, but i'm sure he's happy with you having stayed around.
what goran never did was play 25, 26, 27 straight rallies which you were doing out there. is the grass slow because of all the weather and everything?
is goran still having he was kind of an occasional coach, wasn't he, last year to you? is that still going on?
have you heard from him, by any chance? has the word reached him anywhere in the world? have you had any texts yet that he knows you're in the final?
did he send you a text this afternoon?
at the moment david is one set up. prior to just a couple of weeks ago in the davis cup, you lost every time you played him. but you won a fivesetter on red clay against him. that must fill you with confidence of what might come up tomorrow?
he's a tough character, isn't he?
it won't be as hostile at queen's club tomorrow as i imagine it was in argentina. how hostile was that? i imagine it has to be for the away team.
but he can also be pretty hostile, as well, can't he?
he has a few tricks up his sleeve to intimidate you, doesn't he?
what did he do?
what if it is dimitrov?
you both had very high expectations put on you at a young age, haven't you?
what are your thoughts on that?
are you surprised you're playing really well?
nice to be back in a tour semi again, isn't it?
marin cilic, next match.
this place is a little bit special for you because you won here two years ago?
can you just sort out how difficult it was to win a match against anderson who has such a big serve and he's so powerful?
you seemed to get quite emotional at the end, as well. did you have a little cry? why was that?
the draw seems to have opened up quite well for you now. do you think you can go on and win it?
anderson threatened to come back and take your break away in the third. what was your mindset then? you handled the situation pretty well, it seemed.
were you nervous then?
when you had a little break, it looked like you had a chat with one of the ball girls. can you give us an idea what you were talking about?
good memories coming back?
are you feeling your form is coming back on the grass and the injury behind you and the whole thing?
back to the crowded courts and everything, there are very few places in the u.s.  maybe us open, maybe miami, indian wells  but a lot of our tournaments you see a lot of empty seats. is it kind of frustrating that when you go other places in the world they seem to be better or more consistent fans?
how tough was it to kind of have to almost start again after you had, you know, top 20, things were going along really well?
are you patient by nature?
where would that rank in your wins on grass?
this tournament has had a reputation for supporting young players, and i think you've been here how many years now? when was your first wildcard here?
two years ago. do you feel like a special affinity with the tournament?
that helps, doesn't it?
how about you and grass?
people have been saying for a long, long time that you have the perfect game for it. do you like the stuff?
do you feel like you're sort of on the verge of making that really significant breakthrough? you have been around there for a long time now.
years ago people would have maybe thought a promising junior like yourself should be in the top 20 by 21, but do you agree that's different now because a lot of the tournament players are older, and do you think you have to be a lot more patient coming up?
do you think you're a senior junior or a junior senior?
do you think you're quite close to the olympics cut? are you really hopeful you might get in?
coaching at the moment is patrick?
so who is with you this week?
when you have weeks like that, do you still speak to patrick?
is that tough for a young junior senior like you, you know, having a 24/7 coach all the time? do you need a bit of space sometimes?
have you felt pressure over the years as being almost designated as "the" next big one?
where are you playing last week?
'shertogenbosch?
where did you feel it went wrong, andy?
was it the case of adjusting to the grass or he played particularly well or a little bit of both?
as far as wimbledon goes, how worried are you about that?
what will you do from now on?
do you feel things have been going well in practice the last few days?
was that a factor, you think, in the defeat today, the fact you hadn't had much time on grass?
is this the most difficult transition, do you think, in the game? if you're a little bit worried about the treacherous nature of the grass, does that sow a few seeds of doubt in your mind?
there have been quite a few instances recently of you dropping serve immediately after you've made a breakthrough. is that something you've talked about with ivan?
does that become a factor? do you think about that? when you break serve, do you think, oh, i hope i don't go into that mode again and drop serve straightaway?
when you get onto the grass, what is the bigger factor? the timing of your shots or the movement or it just goes hand in hand?
tommy haas yesterday suggested you have more injuries and you make the most out of them. are you disappointed in that?
(off microphone.)
the thing about not playing doubles here?
you may consider eastbourne?
you started so confidently. did you feel coming into the match that you thought you had a good chance today?
do you think actually having a match before he starts is a distinct advantage?
is this one of your best wins?
he seemed to think it was a bit slippery. was it?
yet you play such a good grass court style. you like to come in, you like to mix it up. i mean, that is always going to be an advantage against someone who is complaining a little bit about the surface. if you play with different styles, you're probably going to win more points than someone who is losing his footing and complaining a bit.
how much confidence did you derive from your performance at roland garros this year? although you lost that match in the end, but just the way you played.
now people in england will know you for something other than the marathon match.
what was your verdict from the match today?
he has got one of the best serves on tour right now. how big was it?
when you saw the draw obviously it's quite a significant week for you did you kind of think, oh, shit?
how about progress through the year, james? give us kind of your debrief on how you think the year has gone.
is this your busiest year travelwise? have you ever traveled...
how do you stay positive when you're having tough weeks?
are you saying you think there is a lot of unfair criticism of british players?
are you assuming or is it built into your plan that you'll get a wildcard for the olympics?
do you encouragement from how so many players are coming through at a later age these days and how they're sustaining their careers for longer?
on that argument, the amount of traveling that you do, do you think that perhaps we underestimate the necessity to have more tournaments in this country? there was a decision taken about four or five years ago we should make everyone go abroad and become men and go off and play all these tournaments in these godforsaken places. do you think if we had a better tournament structure in this country it would help our players develop?
plus you have more challengers.
when you're playing at queen's, eastbourne, wimbledon, and you talk about people who haven't seen your training and what you do the whole year round, a lot of these people are turning up and just expecting or hoping that a brit can pull off a win, turning up to wimbledon. then when it doesn't happen, they get quite critical. do you feel that there is pressure or do you get annoyed at the expectation? what is it like as a british player at this time of year? what goes through your head?
so 22 aces in 9 service games. makes it quite tough?
him serving like that, it doesn't really give you a chance to get into your game, does it?
i suppose that the next question is what do you do next? do you perhaps play somewhere else? try and get more matches in somewhere else?
are you hoping to get in the olympics?
have you had a chat with...
how have you been hitting in practice?
you have never really had much luck with draws, have you? what were you thinking when you saw the draw on this occasion?
are you excited about wimbledon approaching? ten years since you won there and you got a wildcard today. are you pumped for that?
are you planning to use that membership between now and the start of the tournament?
does a member have to apply for a wildcard?
but you have been there for a couple of times recently just to...
got a few there, have you?
what are your sort of hopes for wimbledon? do you still consider yourself to be among the few genuine grass courters who can make a great run?
i wonder what you thought i'm sure you watched the french open final  what you currently think of djokovic and nadal and where they've taken the game?
on the point of the wildcard, how long ago did you ask for it? when did they actually let you know that you had it? obviously it was officially announced today, but how long have you known that you've got it?
obviously the last three or four years have been difficult for you, but you've clearly worked really hard all the way through that. what's been the motivation for you? have you had a particular goal each time?
what was that like as an experience compared to last year?
how much have you played on grass so far this year?
did you feel long term that you can play well on grass?
you have got a wildcard for wimbledon. that must be a big boost.
you get quite frustrated on court a bit. are you trying to channel that a little bit?
how difficult is it to go from winning junior grand slams to trying to make your mark on the senior tour?
you've obviously seen how much of a dog fight it is in futures. you'll try to get out of there as much as possible?
do you feel confident that kind of so far you're on course to make what is traditionally a very difficult, probably "the" most difficult part of your career or anybody's career, that sort of 19, 20, trying to break through in the seniors?
was that a useful experience for you?
difficult to play someone who serves quite that huge in your first grasscourt experience and something like the conditions like this, isn't it?
what are the main positives you can take from that?
what would you say is the main difference between someone like him who has been around for 10 years, more than that, maybe, and someone like yourself just starting? what's the general feeling out there?
as a fellow lefthander, do you get my hints, or does it go by too quickly?
looks like that puts you into the top 200.
obviously a big satisfaction for you?
what would be a good week for you here?
yes.
is he a guy you've enjoyed watching with his flamboyance?
top 200 now. do you have any particular goals beyond that?
the wildcards were announced.
how important is that to you, not just being involved in a grand slam, but the money it brings and what it enables you to do.
you grew up sort of playing alongside andy murray. do you see any of him in oli golding in terms of, you know, a, being a good ball striker, and b, the way he conducts himself on the court?
is tomorrow the biggest match of your career? i mean, argentina davis cup may compare?
what were the conditions like out there today?
you've obviously had more than your share of bad luck with injuries and ailments. i presume the incident with the blood disorder, does that make everything else pale into insignificance really subsequent to that?
do you ever think where you might be now if you hadn't had those physical difficulties over the years?
you said a couple weeks ago that the physical work you have been doing with andy or the tennis has helped you a lot.
do you still think that the kind of the lot, the british tennis professional, is underrated and undervalued?
what you actually do through the year, what you have to go through, the work you put in. do you think sometimes it's underrated, undervalued by the masses?
it's difficult to tell from that match, but is that a bit of a confidence booster for you?
your first experience of this rather sedate surroundings of eastbourne. what do you make of it?
do you need to sort of take a mellow attitude towards how you are and how you're going to be over the next few days, do you think?
looking towards wimbledon, what is it going to take for someone other than djokovic, federer, nadal to win it?
state of the courts? are they good?
they have had a reputation in the past to be a wee bit uneven and a little bit...
well, how satisfying was that today under the circumstances?
yeah.
so in terms of satisfying wins, where would that rank, do you think?
talk about belief, is it also a belief you can get a similar ranking to the guy you have beaten out there today?
when you look out there, his attributes and where he's ranked and your attributes and where you're ranked, do you see that gap? is it belief that separate you from a top 50 spot?
so you're better today. but do you feel you have the credentials to hit that top 50?
you've stayed very loyal to keith, haven't you, over the years as your coach. i suppose he could be perceived as a little bit of an outsider. clearly what you and he have developed over the years has worked very well for you. can you encapsulate what that relationship is like?
they should hand you the trophy already. that was a massive last game, a 15minutes last game.
eight dueces and six match points. how were feeling?
have you played a game like that before? and what does a win like that in a game like that do for your confidence?
what happened in that last game? was it a little bit of nerves or just one of those things?
you haven't won a final and you haven't lost a set this week. how are you feeling about playing nieminen tomorrow?
how much would it mean to you to finally get that first tour win?
will dinner tonight be anything special. will you load up on a big plate of pasta? red meat?
exhausting would probably be your overriding feeling, but you must be bitterly disappointed.
what were you thinking in the last game, that tenth game? some of julien's serves were going into the backhand court. did you think he was tiring? what was going through your mind?
did you miss the big crowd support that you had last night versus today?
what was the key to you playing aggressive like you did last night or not playing as aggressive as you would like to like you did today?
it seems that a few times you've come out of the blocks a little slow. is it just because it's hard to back up so quickly after playing another game? is there any reason?
the slow starts to matches.
what kind of recovery will you do? you played last night and today.
great result. very happy with that one?
how much confidence did you take out of the tiebreak in the first set when you saved two set points?
your aggressive play today, is that kind of the most aggressive we've seen you at this tournament? and how far back do you have to go...
i think that's your highest ranked scalp since andy murray in rotterdam last year. is that showing you you can play that high level of tennis?
what was the turning point for you? was it during the first set tiebreak? seemed you kind of stepped it up a notch during the tiebreaker; is that right?
juan said before he sensed you were getting better and better as the match went on. did you feel that way?
what did you make of the crowd? juan obviously talked to fergus at one point. what did you make of that whole situation? did you think they were fair, the crowd?
did you enjoy having the large percentage of them?
there is some idea out there that the tournament is open pretty wide for you with seeds falling out in other sections of the draw. do you think that you've got a good chance to go all the way?
i think that's eight straight for you in sydney going back to 2010. are you getting comfortable here?
you seemed a bit frustrated during that match. what happened?
you had a couple of words with the umpire on a couple of separate occasions. what was that about?
have you had any problems with the umpiring at the tournament so far? was it just today that you had a problem with the umpire?
where to from here for you?
how do you assess your form at the moment?
will you go to melbourne straightaway and practice?
could you say a few words about today's opponent? do you know about him a lot? could you describe his game, his strengths, and weaknesses?
the close losses are always tough ones. talk us through your feelings now and how close you felt you got.
we have to ask, because jelena spoke about it yesterday and sam, too, the pressure of playing before a home crowd. you didn't seem to find that any problem at all.
did you come out red hot today, or did marcos come out a bit slow?
there were a few more errors in the last few sets. is it as simple as that?
the double fault in the second set, was that a deflating moment for you?
couple of first round exits from the australian open. what would be a successful tournament for you?
do you have a goal? third round?
you were the last aussie in singles left. did you get a sense this was a chance for you to grab a bit more of the spotlight?
you said today wasn't your best tennis.
happy with your own serve? you got plenty of free points.
it's been a good run to melbourne: two quarterfinals back to back, brisbane and here.
how hard was it with the ball toss and everything out there with the wind?
do you normally have a hit after a match?
did he surprise you a little bit today?
was it just the conditions that led to your slow start?
you're up against del potro. thoughts on that?
you must have been very pleased after the first five games, that run between there when you were up a break in the second set. you played some terrific tennis.
you were competitive in perth, and here you're getting the wins. do you feel frustrated?
during the course of a threeset match, does your movement stay the same?
do you want to try to get a match at kooyong or anything?
in terms of the toe, where do you put it at? 95%?
hard to put a number on it?
is it fairly better than the first match at hopman?
what do you do to recover? ice the toe?
painful?
is it something that could go at any time? it's a bit of an unknown in the back of your mind?
do you see yourself back here next year. do you think you got another year?
both sam and jelena have spoke about the pressure of winning in australia. both said they thought it very was tough here. as someone who has had success here yourself, can you understand what they're talking about?
you feed off it. you understand how it can work the other way?
matthew, you'd gone out in the first round last year. this year was better; you got the win.
did you feel like you improved a lot since brisbane last week?
possibly marcos baghdatis in the next round. how do you feel about that?
was it a nice feeling to be out there on center court today and be able to work through this match the way that you did and close it out?
do you feel like that's the difference between where you are and where you're hopefully going, is being able to come through matches like this and take those few points and come through no matter what?
are there more nerves playing in australia?
during the match, you got messages coming in from around the world people wondering how you managed to look so dead in the second and third sets and still managed to come through. how did you manage to come through?
this breathing problem, are you seeing a doctor about it or is it related to hayfever or something?
you played many tough matches in your career. where do you rank this one?
you know andy pretty well. have you noticed a difference in his attitude compared to last year's final?
what effect do you think it will have to have spent so much physical energy and have to play nadal?
do you take any encouragement from the fact when rafa won it here a couple years ago the role was reversed?
what will you do for the next 48 hours to get yourself ready?
you had a great run against rafa whenever you met him last year. what, if at all, will that play on your mind or on his mind?
were you ever scared in this match, a thought that ever came to you that you might lose this match?
comparing him to when you saw him here a year ago, is his forehand a very much more aggressive shot?
technically changed, as well?
did he give you a reminder that as no.1 it's going to be very, very hard for you to keep your no.1 ranking, let alone stay in the top 3?
you had some breathing problems in the middle of that match. how do they compare to some previous matches you've had in the past? was it worse or about the same?
how do you solve it, with medication during the match?
your girlfriend was in a lovely red dress today. she stood up many times cheering for you in crucial moments. you were looking at her, as well. did that help you that she was here and she was standing up there?
do you think missing the warmup tournaments here in australia has been a help to your fitness?
have you seen rafa's matches during this tournament?
what do you think of his play?
the four of you have real clear water between the other players behind you in the sense that you're always in this point of the tournaments. has that been contributory to each of you keeping each other honest, motivated, and the desire of winning in an era when there are yourself and three others?
congratulations. how do you think you have succeeded to turn this match around tonight?
when you're in a match like that and he has started so well, can you draw on your experience to having beaten him now so many times in grand slam matches? can that be an inspiration for you even when he's playing well?
that's not a grand slam.
you celebrated like it was a final. did it feel like that to you?
i guess the question is whether or not you feel like you're playing aggressive enough with the forehand and more inside the court with the backhand and feeling calm enough if you have to play novak this time to get over on him again.
you said when you were interviewed on the court that if you were told before the tournament that you had made the final you would not believe it. is that because of the injuries you have had or what?
how is that knee feeling?
do you think having the extra days to recover on the final will be a big advantage for you? having the extra day advantage for the final? your opponent plays tomorrow night.
roger says he has the impression that you play your best tennis against him. do you have that impression, as well?
would you rather play andy in the final than novak?
what are your thoughts on the other semis, and how closely will you watch that match having in mind andy changed his coach and djokovic had so much success against you last year?
it was another great, great match, but also big loss. how do you explain it? do you think it was a matter of few points or also legs at the end were a little tired?
you're having trouble with your forehand. was there any reason for that, do you think?
we have heard what rafa thinks of the rivalry. what's your take on it after a game like that tonight?
we saw his emotions after the match. what were yours as you left the court?
how many times do you think you'll keep coming back here?
still have a few left in you, do you think?
i think you lost 11 points after the break. is there any frustration in having a timeout in the middle of an intensematch like that with the fireworks?
the margins are always so fine and you had to deal with if you win everything it's fine, and if you lose everything is sort of a disaster.
you cope with these victories and losses more than anyone on the tour right now. how do you keep your equilibrium on occasions like this?
do you think there was a key moment today maybe when you had break point...
do you think rafa seems to play better against you than the other players? do you know why? do you have an explanation?
it's always an event when you two play. did the sense of occasion feel significantly different today, given it was a semifinal and not a final?
did it feel different though walking off before a trophy presentation this time?
you now trail 82 in grand slams to nadal. is that in your mind when you go on court?
(question regarding rafa's record against him in grand slams.)
if you're down two sets to one versus nadal, is that the worst feeling you can have against another player? he's the player that worries more you when the match goes long, long, long, three hours and so on? no difference?
do you have a pick from the other semi? what kind of game do you think andy will play now since he's working with lendl against djokovic?
you and andy had a 42shot rally in the second game and he won it. what did you think after that?
were you physically tired from the tsonga match still? you seemed sometimes to be a little out of breath.
are you disappointed with how today went? i mean, obviously you've had a fantastic tournament. would you have liked to have gone further?
in two matches against murray you couldn't make more than three games in a set. is there a problem of matchup with andy murray?
you talked about his defense. do you think his attack is good enough for him to win this tournament?
do you regret at all playing mixed doubles yesterday?
you're going to rise to a new ranking of no.20 next week. can you just talk about what that means to you.
your case is a little bit unique which is hard for others in asia to emulate because you train in the usa. what would you advise male players inspired by your success?
in terms of your own physical condition, andy murray was saying you've been hitting the gym a lot lately. i'm just wondering how much more growing do you have to do personally?
do you think it will be another two or three years before you reach the sort of maximum body size for you personally?
you mentioned physically it's very difficult to play against the players. can you talk about mentally how it is to play against the players who are stronger and taller than you. do you think technicallywise you should play smarter, especially for the asian players, to compete in the tour?
what tournaments will you play next?
you've beaten djokovic last year. you will be in the top 20 next week. what do you see for your future?
are you going to go back to japan straightaway? what do you think will be the reception you'll get?
there was a time in the second set when you looked right on top. did you feel that and what happened?
did you notice he looked a bit like he was ailing at times in the second set, hanging over his racquet, holding his leg? did you notice that at all?
it was so close. do you feel it could have gone either way?
people this week have been talking about a gap between the top four players and then the next group, then a third group under that. do you think there were times tonight that you showed the gap was very tiny?
do you think that gap can be closed?
you clutched your hamstring and seemed to be in real pain for a moment. was it a pulled hamstring? what was the problem?
do you have any physical issues that are worrying you ahead of the next match? the breathing seemed to be a bit of a problem.
it's now andy again, which is probably the most familiar opponent to you. how much of a psychological edge will you have after last year's final? do you think that still counts?
andy is going to want to get you into some long rallies, as well. are you confident over the next two days you'll be able to get your breathing back right?
you have a slightly shorter break heading into friday's match. also, if you win that, you'll have a shorter break ahead of your opponent in the final.
before the really big matches, what strategies do you employ, breathing through the nose like yoga, something like that?
three out of the last four grand slams have been yourself, roger, rafa, and andy. maybe the next grand slam you can play a round robin. i know you talked about the issue, but it's becoming more and more clear the top four are playing at a slightly higher level than the rest of the guys. we've seen it here again.
last year before the final andy talked about you playing football with each other in perth and here. has there been much of that? do you sense he's different with lendl now?
you knew andy was looking for a coach. were you surprised ivan turned up in his box? how do you think it changes the dynamic for this meeting between the two of you?
you've changed coaches. can there be a strong shortterm effect, do you think, if you change?
from outside, what do you see that's different about andy?
the level of play tonight was quite exceptional. how did you manage to turn the match around, do you think?
for him maybe?
with novak being no.1 and now when you play roger it's 2 versus 3, is it still as special as it ever was for you to play roger?
five hours and 40 minutes with verdasco, four and 16 minutes with berdych, but two different matches. one celebration tonight; the other more rhythm. which was hard are for you? which one was more tiring? is it more difficult for you to recover now or not?
that's why i'm asking.
why were you nervous in the first two sets against a guy you had won nine matches in a row against?
i would guess that you probably against roger are going to have to play how you played in the third and fourth sets rather than the first and second, because maybe he won't give you a chance to come back in the match.
no.
the last eight times you've played roger in a grand slam final you've won six of those. does that fill you with confidence going into the next match?
still rafa, to play best of five seems an advantage for you, to be honest. i mean, you won the last four times you've played against him, bestoffive sets, and he's 30 years old. okay, great class, great talent, we know it. but physically normally you're stronger, or no?
just on that point about the umpire's decision in the tiebreak, do you think that hawkeye has stopped umpiring as they used to? they're a little bit concerned about making decisions because they know they have the camera?
how important was it at the early part of the match to kind of put a marker down and show that you weren't going to be intimidated by him in those early exchanges?
it felt pretty airless out there. were the conditions quite brutal?
yeah.
when you saved the fourth break point on 53 in the second set after a long, long rally, you made one of the loudest roars i have ever heard from you.
there are endless milestones you have been passing on the way. what does it actually mean to you to rack up 1000 and do it in such style, as well?
you didn't win your 1000th match, but you won 2000 sets in those 1000.
yes, today. with first with the first set, that was your no.2000.
do you think the semifinal lineup will now be the top four players in the world?
do you feel like you're striking the ball as well as you ever have and in comparison to the top 2, or is the perfectionist in you still a bit dissatisfied?
those rafa comments before the start of the tournament are probably forgotten for you, but does this make a difference if you play against him in the semifinal? does it change something?
does it feel different being on the same side of the draw as him for the first time a long time? you met him several grand slam finals. obviously first time in a semi potentially since '05.
this is the other side of the game, but did you feel a little bit of sympathy with caroline wozniacki who has had to put up with a lot of, not criticism necessarily, but a lot of investigation into the fact that she's been the no.1 player of the world without winning a slam. been taking quite a bit of schtick for what she's done. do you feel a little bit of sympathy for her in that situation?
you hear on tv they talk about statement wins, which they said about you tonight. does that concept even exist? are there results during a tournament that other players make that echo with you?
are you able to compare those matches against del potro? you had some tough ones and that was so easy. does that mean you are a little better? is he a little worse?
worried at all about keeping the momentum you had at the end of last season, because there is that break. you can't really...
do you ever lose sleep before a big game or big match?
rod laver arrived here today. is there an extra feeling, an extra special feeling when someone like him is around to watch a grand slam?
quite a match. it's hard, i'm sure, to talk about it right away. what were your feelings about the end of the second set? was that what really made the difference in your mind, not getting him there? how did you see it?
when you play nadal, do you always expect a match to go that long? i mean, it was over four hours before the fourth set was done.
do you feel like a match like this gives you hope for the next time because it was so close and you fought him hard? you've lost to him a few times in a row now. is it more frustrating now?
how are you doing physically? i saw you stretching a few times later in the match. what was the problem?
you mentioned the top guys. you're one of the people right under the top three, four players. do you feel like there is a ceiling you're bumping up against? do you feel there is a big gap between the top four and everybody else?
how much did the crowd reaction the other night against almagro, did that bother you a lot, and was it nice to hear the crowd tonight cheering?
were you surprised by the reaction from last round?
obviously the game plan was to play to his backhand, yes?
you were yawning on the way in. was a very tiring match?
do you feel okay?
tsonga has been quite famous for fiveset matches at the australian open. were you prepared to go the distance against him today?
will you still play mixed doubles tomorrow?
can you explain the problem with the surface at the start of the second set.
so it was a good break for you, the interruption?
you said you had some messages from people back home this week. can you tell us about who's been sending you messages and what they've said.
are you aware of the impact that your career is having? are more young kids playing tennis in japan?
you're the first japanese man into the australian open quarterfinal since 1932. do you know who that was?
do you feel a lot of pressure seeing as it's been such a long time since a japanese player has reached the quarterfinal?
how tough was it to close the match today?
do you feel like this is the biggest step of your career?
how do you see your next match?
how do you regard your influence as a role model to inspire especially young male players from east asian countries, including japan, korea, and china?
did you sense that he was struggling early on?
did you sense he was going to retire at some point?
is it difficult to keep your concentration in that kind of situation?
what does this do for your own preparation?
so it's not necessarily a bonus in terms of not working as hard as maybe you needed to?
it's possible you might have to play during the day again here. would you welcome that? do you think your durability gives you a potential advantage?
you've done a great preparation for the match. then to go out there in those circumstances, is it a bit of an odd day for you?
you'd take a few boring wins, wouldn't you?
was it a bit of a shock when he broke you?
looks like kei is two sets to one up as we speak. can you just talk about those two guys, the challenges they present.
with kei, can you see what influence brad has had with him?
one of the things people found pretty interesting was ivan covering the camera to stop his face from being broadcast on the big screen. was that a joke or is he camera shy?
do you think it's fair there should be a camera right there?
yes.
kukushkin is coached by his wife. if kim was helping you this week, what do you think she'd be telling you?
can you share how it's been working with ivan, what you like so far best working with him?
a week into the tournament, how do you assess your own progress through the draw?
that was a huge fight after the first two sets. how were you feeling on the court? do you think maybe you were this close to winning?
how much did winning that third set mean to you?
could you sense what has improved in his game?
you've been no.1. you've defended grand slam titles. can you talk about what that pressure is like, what that feels like? it's kind of new for him.
you had that situation in wimbledon where that didn't turn out well.
with the fourth set, do you feel you could have done anything different in hindsight?
after such a tournament, what are your expectations for the upcoming tournaments?
overall would you say you're happy with how far you've come?
what were your feelings when you left the court tonight with this atmosphere?
are you switching over to do tv work again this year?
did you take any extra time when you left the court tonight? did you feel like that's probably it?
what happened in the third set? you relaxed a bit or it was him?
you had some physical problems?
this was your first big test since the beginning of the tournament. how do you evaluate your form now?
can you tell us a little bit more about your insights into the top four?
do you think it's also a matter of personality? for instance, today ferrer came, he's no.5 in the world, there was nobody, no english questions, nobody cares. it's all on the top four.
it's said sometimes it's easier to climb the mountain than to stay there. a sense of that going into this season?
you've been at the top for six months or so. how comfortable is the no.1 skin feeling?
girls included?
you seemed very calm even down a breakpoint in the fourth. is it confidence that you're not feeling the fear anymore in these situations?
what do you think you gained most out of that match tonight?
what was your game plan tonight to try and overcome him?
how do you sort of say what you learnt most out of it then?
can you put it into specific areas sort of where it tells you where you need to get better as you get older to play these best players?
what was different about tonight that you learned compared to sydney?
seems like after a couple of his dropshots you shook your head and said, wow.
do you feel like just playing roger made you more tense in the game, or do you feel like you're playing your best? how did it feel out there against someone like roger?
did he say anything to you at all after the game?
how far away are you from the top 4 group? you mentioned there is that gap. obviously to improve yourself you're going to have to beat them. how far away do you think you are?
is it conceivable for you that one day you can be in that special group that you talk about?
how do you put this tournament in perspective for how it sets up your year?
you were ranked 37 coming here. where do you think you stand at the moment?
you said earlier in the tournament that fitness was something you can improve on. is that something you will look at over the next couple of months?
would it be fair to say, with all respect, did you feel like a teenager out there tonight? was it sort of like man versus boy to an extent?
it has been a very exciting week for the australians, both yourself and lleyton. now it is just down to lleyton. how would you describe the run that he's been on and the challenge now that lies ahead tomorrow night?
can you talk about your partnership with qantas? will you be announcing anything in the next couple of days?
yeah.
your dad's wearing the cap and you're in their ads wearing a qantas shirt.
how good is it for you physically that you've had straightsets matches so far?
do you feel like you're improving, getting better with every match?
how did you feel about your serve in this tournament? in the us open you said you need more free points with your serve. how did you feel it in this tournament?
i wonder if you had watched any of tomic in this championship, and just get your assessment of how he plays the game.
what are your thoughts on lleyton hewitt making this run at this stage in this tournament?
were you involved in the design of the tshirt?
you mentioned milos' coach is spanish. have you spoken to him during the tournament?
would it mean a lot to you to make it through the quarterfinals here this year after the last two years you dropped out of the quarterfinal stage?
you play against so many different kind of players. what goes on in your mind if you're playing against a player of your own country? is it emotionally different or the same?
was it much easier than you expected or different or what?
do you think that the first set was going to be an imperative? most objective people thought that perhaps if he won the first set it might be a very tight match. but as it turned out, you winning the first  just to lift the nervous a little bit?
do you feel like your game lifted after the first set, or do you feel like tomic kind of...
are you playing well enough to win this thing again?
in what you've seen of bernard in two matches, how do you rate his potential for the future?
on that same theme, it has been a very exciting week for the australians, both with tomic and hewitt. the new hope is gone now it's just lleyton. how would you describe the run he's one, particularly at this tournament with all the injuries and challenges, and now the big challenge that lies ahead of him for tomorrow night.
will you be watching?
could you reflect a little on when you were 19? i think that was the year you beat pete at wimbledon. just being at the levels perhaps that switzerland didn't expect but you expected, and when we saw you, the world expected. how have you coped with that and how you plotted your course from there on?
14 years ago you played your first match in gstaad, and next match will be your no.1000.
do you mind to tell us something about all those 1000 matches now? (laughter.)
what has been the worst moment of all?
what do you remember of your first title in milan? won your first atp title in milan. what do you remember of that?
two years ago you played del potro. it was 63, 63, 6love.
what do you foresee now? do you think you won't repeat that score?
do you have any regrets about not shaking his hand at the end of the match?
in his press conference the other day he was asked if there was any bad blood between you and him. he said not with him, but he said between and you rafa he thought there had been incidents in the past. is that right?
what was it that happened on his side?
so you think it was intentional, him hitting you, then?
but he said sorry on the court.
that's usual in tennis, say sorry. maybe he didn't mean to do that. i don't know. just a question.
if sorry is not enough, what could he have done besides saying sorry?
the crowd seemed to take very much his side against you at the end there. their reaction, were you surprised at that?
your thoughts on your upcoming quarterfinal?
did you watch some of nadal's wins this week? how do you assess his game in this tournament?
have you ever not shaken hands with somebody after a match before? was that the first time?
you'll be the first japanese male player in the fourth round here. you've done a lot of firsts. do those things mean a lot to you, or...
how do you feel you played today?
you came back twice from a break down in the third set. do you think it was the key?
how did you feel physically at the end of the match?
next another frenchman. do you want to talk about playing him?
have you been urged on by the japanese fans here? i've seen a lot of support for you on the courts. has that meant a lot for you and helped your play?
you looked like you really enjoyed yourself out there tonight?
is it the matchup that you like? you like the target at the net, that kind of thing?
different styles of game. where would you say yours is at the moment? how do you feel your game is?
you sort of joked tonight about ivan and a golf course. i know it's been a couple weeks. is there anything you can pinpoint already as to what he's done for your game?
an unexpected fourthround opponent. you've already had a sight of him this year.
you looked really emotional after you won tonight. why does this mean so much to you?
is there a degree of disbelief winning this match?
milos said the pressure from you tonight was consistent. was that the plan, to try to grind him out?
talk about the thirdset tiebreak.
do you think he didn't know when to go for it and when not to? he obviously had to attack. did you feel that he was nervous about attacking you?
rochey looked nervous sitting up in the box. what did he say after the match?
you mentioned that final game. when he had the advantage, you pulled out the big serve, what sort of confidence does that give you going into a match against a player like djokovic?
how do you consider your form at the moment compared to 12 months ago? what do you think you're going to need to improve on for your next match?
were there any signs of inexperience you noticed on his end?
you said most people wouldn't have expected you to get this far. how about within yourself?
what about djokovic, do you give yourself a shot at that one?
do you think the kids will watch the tape of this match in the morning?
did you prove something to yourself or is that like always?
prove something to yourself.
do you credit luczak for the doubles yesterday? a good hit out for this game?
richard, you played beautifully today. how did you feel on the court?
is your confidence rising when you play that well?
there's a lot of french players in the draw this year. do you all get around and help each other and support each other at the slams?
how do you see your chances going far into your home slam, roland garros?
do you feel more pressure there than you do playing here?
how do you see the performance other than the first four games?
you come here having won in auckland again, as last year. where do you see your game?
does last year making the semifinal here change your aim for this tournament?
do you always feel that opponents don't enjoy playing against you, they don't like playing against you?
richard is one of those players who doesn't like to play against you. do you feel that on the court?
you're no.5 in the world. is it disappointing or frustrating that you don't get to play on the two big courts?
how do you find the atmosphere on the other courts?
you played quarter and semi on rod laver last year. do you know how many other matches you've played there?
a long time coming here as a top player and only a few games up there. is it difficult to play on when you don't play very often?
you will play your seventh fourth round in a grand slam in a row. you're a very consistent player. are those stats you look at?
do you still believe you can go even that bit further?
you don't fear them?
would you say that richard is an unpredictable player? sometimes he can play very good; sometimes go through matches and not being on the court almost?
it's looked pretty clinical out there. how has it felt?
could you feel your level at all as a result or not really?
can you recall at a grand slam where you've started in such form?
now that you're through, will you watch tonight? if so, what will you take out of it?
would you rather play lleyton and the crowd or the young canadian?
of all the surfaces you play on around the world, do you consider this the best suited for your game in terms of speed, how the ball bounces, how you feel moving on it?
given the conditions we could face in the second week with the weather here, how important is it to be fresh both mentally and physically?
some people might think that after what you achieved last year, coming into a new year it might be perhaps a burden, something heavy on your shoulders. you seem to be in sort of a chirpy mood, relaxed.
a lot of women, female tennis players, get to pose in their swimsuits for the sports illustrated magazine. do you think that men should have the same opportunity?
so you wouldn't say no if it was tastefully done?
when you were 17 you were playing in italy with piatti. then you were a big supporter of ac milan. now you have a media manager who is italian and you are sponsored by sergio tacchini.
i would like to know if there is a reason for all that. you trying to put up the image of italian tennis, which is a disaster?
how do you explain it?
what is the biggest advantage and the biggest danger of having an easy week like you did in the first week of a major?
the year just started. but from what you have seen till now, do you think by the end of this year we will talk more about the fab five, including del potro, instead of the fab four?
was it as exciting to play as it was to watch?
have you ever experienced a crowd like that before?
in the little world that you live in with your family and camp, can you feel what's going on around you? obviously your girl friend was on the front page of the paper today.
have you noticed that's changed within the last week just out on the street?
you're very calm on court no matter what the circumstances. is that the way you are underneath, as well?
do you feel in the last week australians are almost kind of coming of age?
what happened at the end of the first game in the fifth set.
so in your mind you didn't challenge?
roger federer?
is it an advantage to have got that first game out of the way?
when you were about 12 meeting roger, did you ever think you would be across the net playing him in a grand slam?
do you know what you're thinking now?
how ardent were you in your support of roger? did you stay up late to watch matches, video them, and have posters?
so you don't even watch it now?
did you have a conversation with him in davis cup?
(question about parts of your game.)
how much do you think your game has improved since you last played roger?
did you get a sense that the crowd is almost mesmerized by the tennis? there are long quiet periods. it's almost as though they're drifting off because it's so different. do you get that sense in the middle of it?
was that your best performance of the three tonight, and how much better do you think you have to play on sunday?
you've come a long way in the last 12 months. how much confidence have got to be able to do this and the oncourt interviews, as well?
was there something in the last 12 months that was big on that learning curve?
it would be nice to share all this attention. is there anyone coming up?
idolizing federer, was there anyone match that sticks in your mind?
do you think that players of your generation like you or raonic are ready to win this tournament now?
how are you feeling confidencewise compared to wimbledon?
what will you do to prepare for federer? anything specific?
are you preferencing towards afternoon or evening?
roger hasn't lost before the quarterfinals of slam in like six, seven years? does it excite you, the possibility to be able to end that streak?
what do you see as your greatest strength going into that match?
you sound almost torn about playing him in a way because he was such a huge hero for you.
do you think you will be 100%, because you have now two matches in five sets? after verdasco you said you weren't fit for five sets, and you get another one tonight.
you have mixed tomorrow. thoughts on that?
how was today's match and how do you feel with your knee?
do you like birds? you had to wait for the birds to leave.
do you feel it's been fairly comfortable so far for you? has it been quite easy for you so far?
so far through the tournament.
do you feel as though your progress through the draw has been quite easy?
can you talk about john isner's progress.
well played.
you were hitting the ball pretty well at the end. i saw the last couple of sets from out wide making passing shots. did you feel you hit the ball really well by your standards?
how did you deal with his serve, second biggest serve in the big in the game?
obviously crucial point was the first set when you had a set point. talk me through the federer lob. was it a good shot? did youmistime the shot?
what was difference between you winning and losing? can you sum up the game?
you played such a good fourthset tiebreaker. what happened after that?
how bad are your feet or your toes?
coming off the chair after you win the breaker, what are you thinking about? what do you have to do?
playing a second fifth setter in two days, is that a problem of mental fatigue or physical?
you're making a bit of a specialism of being involved in so many fivesetters. you've got quite a list now. can you explain why that is?
talk about matching up against him. much different match than against nalbandian, right? i mean, he's coming at you, he's playing a ton of slice, he doesn't quite return like nalbandian, but the volley is more there. so totally different change, huh?
so you like you couldn't really dictate a lot? a lot was played on his terms?
this is the first time ever no americans in the fourth round at the australian open. any comment on that? men's game in transition. obviously roddick is feeling it physically.
can you look ahead to davis cup? i assume andy is not gonna play, so i assume you're gonna be on the team anyway. talk about that. that's going to be a huge challenge if roger plays, huh?
do you expect sam or mardy to go with you?
are you going to go home first or hang out and go from here?
how important do you think your acrobatics on that set point in the first set might have been? it was an amazing get really in the circumstances.
how important was it have a tough workout after the walkover last round?
do you enjoy watching other players play karlovic just to see what they do?
i mean see other players play against karlovic, the approach they take.
there is a difference to play isner or karlovic?
which one?
do you think it would be better for tennis to have more onehanded backhands and less twohanded?
i don't know if you saw the nalbandian/isner match the other night and the contentious way it came to a close. would you like to see there be a more uniform way of deciding if a player has taken enough time to challenge? it seems to be a gray area. i know you've got controversial views on hawkeye, anyway.
do you think there should be a time limit?
do you tend to be one who if you challenge they know instantly you're going to because you just go and challenge?
talking about onehanded backhand, did you realize in the first set in 52 you hit a twohanded backhand?
thank you.
any thoughts on hewitt and raonic tomorrow night?
i think so.
you have attended probably 2000 press conferences in your life. have you never been worried about facing any of them in certain specific situations?
i was just asking if you always come here relaxed, even after defeat, or sometimes you worry about questions that can be asked?
can you tell us what you think about your potential opponents in the fourth round?
what did you think of tomic in the davis cup?
did you see marcos baghdatis smash four racquets the other night? what's your view on that? do you do it?
yeah.
i don't think so.
do you get that agitated now or are you just better at hiding it? are there moments you want to do something like that, like mcenroe hitting some flowers out of...
back on ivo, you and he have played many, many tiebreakers. is it something you expect every time you play him and it's going to be a matter of just getting a handful of points off his serve to win?
you are very close to 1000 matches on tour? does it feel like that? how does it feel?
does one stand out in the 1000?
do you want to tell us what happened out there.
was it moving both ways or just your left that was hurting you the most?
was this at all related to the injury you had after wimbledon last summer?
why did you play on? was that because of the occasion, because of the crowd? did you feel you wanted to see how bad it was?
what made you decide to call it?
your decision to stop, can you tell us why you made that decision then?
did the doctor advise you could have damaged it further?
did it actually happen in the fall?
injuries are something you can't control. are you feeling a little snake bitten from the last couple years?
you're saying three weeks. that means no davis cup, and you're thinking san jose?
did you have any thoughts of playing davis cup anyways?
do you think that perhaps there should be a longer look in the sport in general at the number of hard court events that are played throughout the year? it's only happened to you in the last couple of years. but for the future benefit of the sport, we have to look at surfaces, technology. there have been so many advances, but in those advances there have been so many injuries, mental and physical.
injuries like what you might have makes you think about your career in the context of where you might be at. are you having those thoughts?
just to clarify, left or right?
was it a little patchy from both of you today?
how do you explain three or four breaks towards the end there?
did you feel him drawing you in throughout the match? he was egging you on a little bit. was that something you were able to work on during the match? how frustrating was that?
you felt okay about your movement and getting to those balls?
you don't look ahead, but do you know what happens next?
how do you feel about that?
what are your memories of that final against andy? a lot of us recall the match point.
you were running around on the backhand side to hit forehands today. is that something you do consciously?
do you like the fact that the pressure is now on them? first two matches you were supposed to win. you might even be the underdog.
how were the conditions out there for you today?
in this tournament players are breaking their racquets on the court. what are your thoughts on that?
do you know why players are doing that more?
how are you enjoying your time in melbourne at the moment?
solid performance.
how solid a performance was that?
do you believe you were hitting the ball a bit harder today?
i think you hit 41 winners today, which sounds like quite a high number. is that down to the quality of your opponent or of your play?
are you going to look forward to the different sort of challenge that michael is going to give you? he's got one way of playing, and he'll keep playing that way up at the net.
a lot of players, especially the younger players, talk about playing aggressive. do you buy into that, or would you say playing smart is equally as important?
are you seeing a lot of patterns where you know the guy you're playing, and are you being more reactive, or are you seeing four or five moves ahead?
when you win the first set as powerfully as you did today, he picked up his game. do you start to explore some shots as you go through the next two sets?
you like to express yourself, get a little bit angry. the concept of smashing four racquets in 20 seconds is an alternative to just shouting at the ball?
would you like to go back to those days?
if you take away the rules, go back to the old rules...
yes.
everybody expresses themselves.
spectators might like it as well.
the taunting and teasing in the old days, you talked about how mohammed ali did that with fraizer. i take it you might enjoy someone to spar with?
if you had a chance, would you watch mayweather and pacquiera? who would you like to see win that one?
did you lament the demise of the tackle in football?
they don't tackle anymore.
outside of your own rivalries, what match would you turn on tv between any two guys?
are you going to watch that funky dolgopolov/tomic match?
did you sense anything before the extended injury time halfway through the second set that there was something wrong with your opponent?
other players when they have shortened matches will get on the treadmill. are you likely to do anything tonight?
is the doubles complementing your fitness at this stage?
can you talk about what it's mentally like when you know your opponent is hurt, trying to have the killer instinct to finish him off?
did you notice him doing anything to change his tactics, make points shorter when he was hurt?
it seems your emotions are a lot more raw.
you celebrated strongly with your firstround win. your emotions seem different.
you seem to be freer with your emotions. you're enjoying it, by the looks.
how do you feel your game is coming along?
your serve? obviously you had the problem. you served more aces against him first time in your career.
you said a few times you would have liked a few more games in the summer. do you feel like you're getting better at hitting it cleaner?
milos, you haven't played him before, but you would have seen him during the year. what does he bring to the table for you?
is there a special degree of sympathy you have with roddick in this situation?
what did you get from such an easy win?
in that fifth game when you got broken, i think you made four unforced errors. do you still get a bit nervous even after what you've done the last year or so?
you came back to win love the next game.
you say you don't get really nervous anymore. you've had so much success on that court particularly. are there times when you kind of feel a little bit invincible out there on rod laver arena?
next is mahut. do you remember the first time you played him?
cherbourg. and he won.
you know bernard tomic quite well. have you been watching him this australian open?
do you have an impersonation of bernard yet?
when are we going to see some more impersonations?
you're on twitter a lot. who do you like to follow on twitter?
did you see marcos baghdatis smashing his racquets last night?
you've smashed one or two racquets in your time. is it useful to you? does it help getting emotion out?
who is the best racquet smasher you've seen?
can you tell us a bit about the movie you're in? what is your role?
do you have a line in there?
i heard you say you're in a fight.
you communicate a lot with social media. is it a way to show another face of yourself, or is it a way to change the media world, if i can say?
came out serving very hard. what do you think you were able to do to turn it around after that?
did you sort of do anything technically in particular to change that and get the win?
are you getting so comfortable on rod laver arena that it might be a bit of a disappointment if you might have to play a match somewhere else in this championship?
you played in daytime in the heat, and then you played tonight, cooler. how do you adjust your game to allow for the different conditions?
what advantage is it knowing you're going to play 7:00 on an evening schedule?
how did it feel yesterday after the marathon? pretty good?
alexandr has give you trouble in the past. what exactly is it that you have trouble with him?
in that shanghai match you seemed so frustrated that you just kind of seemed to go away in it. did you feel that way? how do you not do that this time?
do you consider yourself a streaky player at all?
jelena jankovic said you two had talked in brisbane about playing mixed doubles here, but i don't think you signed up for it. what happened there?
you didn't talk to her in brisbane?
you said the other day that you had the feeling you could take the match whenever you needed to. did you have that feeling today?
would you prefer a day match for the next one?
can you just compare how you're feeling compared to this time last year?
it's never nice to lose in very controversial circumstances, but clearly it was a pretty dispiriting end to the match for you.
what do you make of the umpire's decision in that 8all point?
why did he say you couldn't have hawkeye?
then the supervisor came.
and a lot of crowd noise, as well.
you took a break at 67 in the fifth set as well, a toilet break.
yeah, but, you say you didn't lose because of that. so how did it influence then the next game, the next point?
did you think about it or...
you have played many, many grand slam matches in your career. is that as disappointing an ending as you can remember, as annoying from your point of view? it was a great match.
do you know what the rule is for how long you have?
there's no timing manner?
did you see him hobbling late in the match? did you think you wore him down, particularly when you got those break chances?
will you be making an official complaint to the atp or to the supervisor or to the grand slam...
what would you do if you, in your next grand slam, you walk out and you see the same umpire in the chair? would you be happy?
you don't think he's qualified? you don't think he's up to it?
well, he spends most of his time umpiring on the wta tour. that's true.
you seem to like these extravagant matches, john. it was another bit of an extravaganza, wasn't? what do you make of it all at the end there?
what was your take on the whole can we use hawkeye, can't we use hawkeye situation with david at the end?
what did do in the fifth set against nalbandian that you didn't do against cilic last year?
when did you first have cramps? when did they start affecting you?
were you under the impression that you couldn't get treatment at any stage for cramps?
well, you can get treatment for cramps at changeovers.
did you know that?
when you took the bathroom break and sat down and crossed your leg, did your muscle sort of get cold?
subsequently what have you done treatmentwise, and how does it feel now?
how much satisfaction do you derive from beating a guy like that in five sets under the circumstances, especially after your experience here last year?
could you make any comparisons on the level of physical fatigue you were feeling out there deep in the fifth set to what you felt in that match at wimbledon a couple years ago?
have you got kind of a mindset you can slip into when you go into these marathons?
you have been talking about improving your allaround game a lot. did you feel any of those attempts of improvements came through at any times today?
if the decision was down to you, would it be a tiebreak in the fifth or would it be to play out?
this early in the season, how much of a gut check was that for you?
later in 2010 when you were discussing wimbledon and the mahut match, one of the things you said was part of the experience you didn't like was you didn't get to go on to the second week and have a chance to play rafa. now you have lopez, and if you get by there, possibly get to rafa. can you talk about that? actually not being known maybe just for the big fivesetter, but being able to move ahead?
you were sort of working the crowd at the end. seemed to be really enjoying the atmosphere compared to wimbledon, obviously where it's more stoic. just having to do with the mood of the two tournaments, is there a change in attitude there?
was that a tribute to your quarterback there at the end there?
do you think the new clothing sponsor will be happy with almost five hours of air time today?
they were on the wrong endof the one in 2010.
mahut was wearing it...
totally different matchup that's coming up against lopez. talk about that. obviously you can serve and he's a good serve and volleyer; return game is going to be huge there, i think.
when you got the break at the start of the third set, did you feel you were almost back into the match? just knew you had to play a really complete set to beat him, especially here?
you looked pretty dangerous when you were coming to the net and closing out points that way. did you feel that was your best chance of unsettling him?
you were saying you had your injury in brisbane. were you pleased to be out there on a big stage again?
injuries aside, you are showing glimpses of playing really, really well. if you get your body right, do i feel you can play for another two, three, four years?
can you share maybe a little bit of the chat you had with rafa at the end of the match?
you've been obviously on the tour for many, many years. do you have a perspective on the current mood of the players and whether you think they're as united in their desire for change as they have been?
would you think about extending your career if the season was shorter?
what are your thoughts?
what does it do for your rhythm for the week?
it was quite ironic, because a lot has been made of the fact that you played your last 52 matches here on rod laver, and i think you were put outside, so to speak. now the match isn't going to take place at all. were you aware that you had such a record of length of service on the main court here?
they have played men's matches here first in the evening the first three nights. is that something that the players wanted to have, as if they felt as though they should play first, or is it that it just seems to have happened so far this year?
i didn't know whether it was something perhaps you've said, we always seem to play second. could we perhaps play first?
playing at night, serena complained about the bugs and said she didn't want to be out there at night again in in this tournament. did you notice that on the first night?
you had a walkover. can you recall if you had one in a slam before?
that's it.
anything different you do now? chill out a bit?
how are you feeling? two fiveset matches. how are the energy levels?
was it simply the heat or was there an illness or anything like that?
obviously a tight fivesetter, 86. confident the fact that you're able to get through that?
you have bernard next match. you've played him three times. where do you see him at the moment?
what is the key to beating him?
night match? would you prefer a night game?
were you surprised by kamke today?
what happened?
frustrating? disappointing? what is your emotion?
a very emphatic start to your grand slam campaign. you must have been pleased with the way you played today.
how do you think the kooyong preparation worked? you've done brisbane in the past as well.
you've been through these cycles a few times now. what are you looking for out of yourself physically and mentally this season?
what is the optimum number, would you say?
do you feel like you're back at your fighting weight now?
lleyton has won the first set. if he gets through, you'll be playing him. bit of history. how would you view that now?
do you see a parallel in terms of it as guys of the same vintage, being no.1, you had to deal with recently physical issues, and he has also had to deal with an older body?
are you fascinated as to how this year might go off the court as much as on it? obviously been discussion here already about players' responsibilities, demands, thoughts about how the way the game should go. i know you have some pretty interesting thoughts on the subject. what was your view of the weekend and how the argument has progressed in the last 48 hours?
how much of ryan's match did you get to see? what did you make of what you saw?
when asked to name particular challenges of playing against you tonight, robin said one of them is your quickness and your court coverage. do you think that's something that's evolved over the course of your career?
how much do you think that your speed is better now than it was 10 years ago?
with the slowing down of the courts especially?
when you talk about less tournaments, is there a sensitivity to the fact that there are people who have run these tournaments for a long time and that's their living and how do you drop them?
just generic tournaments. if you drop a tournament off the schedule...
if i can ask you to describe the mood of the meeting last weekend, how would you describe it?
do you think it's unfortunate that it's been played out as a split between the game's two biggest figures basically?
at the us open you expressed some doubt that that momentum would carry over. it sounds like it really has. do you feel something is going to come out of this?
you were talking a few moments ago it's mandatory events.
perhaps a little bit like brisbane, a nervousy start, but once you got going, you were fine and comfortable?
what did you think of his game?
in conditions like this, is this when the pain of florida pays off?
have you had any sort of debrief from ivan yet about what he thought about the victory, aspects of it?
you stepped up close to the baseline the second, third, and fourth sets.
the hamstring?
does it feel a little bit different out there on hisense? do you feel as though you're almost slightly removed from everything else?
at one point you didn't seem very happy with your shoes. was it too much grip, not enough grip?
so they're not new ones or different ones you're using?
usually at wimbledon we're asking you about what it's like to be the last brit. second day everyone's gone, so is that more so a disappointment?
very tough match. give us your thoughts on the way you got through it.
can you talk about the adrenaline rush you still get from playing out on a major court in a grand slam, especially at home.
what about the match coming up against andy roddick? must be looking forward to that one.
are you confident you are able to beat andy?
do you feel that you benefited from some of his inexperience? he never challenged when you broke in the 11th game of the first set. on the tv screen, the ball was in.
you've been playing andy roddick for over a decade now. talk about how his game has evolved over the years.
do you think his net game is the biggest change in the last 10 years?
do you have some empathy with sam stosur who doesn't seem to be able to play at her best in front of her home crowd?
you had a tough year with injuries. you moved well. how is the body feeling?
do you have any thoughts on your bad record against roddick and what you might have to do to turn that around?
like it to be at night again, if possible?
you played a lot of night matches on laver. you almost always go second. tonight you were first. how does that compare for you?
do you like the combined events or you not that much of a fan?
how would you sum up the whole experience? how do you think you played?
you played a pretty great first set. must have been feeling pretty emboldened at that point. what was going through your head?
when you did get broken, did you feel he started to click into gear after that?
it was a very hot day. you had some amazing rallies. how did that affect you physically in the end?
in that context, do you think the schedule of the tour is arduous? do you have a view on that, the issue that's come up?
yes.
is there any one area of your game you think you can make the biggest level of improvement in the next year or so?
what are your goals in terms of ranking this year?
you've taken sets off guys like ferrer, andy, soderling. what do you feel is the difference between you and these guys right now?
the margin is pretty small, right?
anything you felt he did better than you?
he's renowned as one of the players with the best slice. you matched him well the first couple sets. where did your slice come from?
you said you played novak recently. how does he compare to playing andy?
talk about the particular challenges of playing andy roddick.
do you think his style makes you hit more errors than you normally would?
can you tell us what this win means to you.
what did you think of your performance today? what was the key to your win?
is this confidence that you can go deep into the tournament?
the next round you play nishikori. how much do you know about him?
did you feel any heightened pressure coming into the match knowing you were playing in front of the home crowd, that you didn't want to let them down?
do you think not having to play through the qualifying rounds helped your preparation?
what do you put down your improvement over the past year or so?
could you tell me a little bit about your background, where you practice?
you looked pretty comfortable out there. were you nervous at all?
what were your expectations really?
seemed to take a couple of deep breaths serving for the match. what was going through the head?
you dream about this kind of stuff. how big is this for you?
have you been to the open before? did you play previous years?
you've been hitting with patrick rafter a bit recently. has that helped at all?
it's tough, but with a win in brisbane and this one here, do you feel like you're on your way?
did you spend last year mostly in europe on the clay?
mainly challengers and futures?
did you get any starts in any atp events?
are you still studying?
melbourne deakin?
it's the luck of the draw, isn't it? you could have drawn anyone. you got a qualifier. you still have to make the most of it, don't you?
how important is it for you to save yourself in the first round? is it something you're thinking about when you're on the court, or you don't think at all about it?
you touched on the conditions. were they pretty unbearable out there?
anything you can do about it or you try to do differently in your approach?
a lot has been said over the past two or three days for the push for change at the top of the men's game. do you have any feelings on that yourself?
you came to the net a lot of times today. is it a new direction you want to take for your game?
are you looking at your draw? how is it going? what are the options that you have?
in terms of steps forward, you've taken two very big ones here in melbourne winning the event. which one do you think was bigger to getting you to where you are now, 12 months ago or four years ago?
was beating rafa on the clay courts not really a surprise  or maybe it was a surprise for you. maybe that was the ultimate test that you had gone up another level last year.
did you measure yourself against andy murray up until maybe 12 months ago? do you think you saw yourself against him in terms of your career?
where do you think you've got the edge in results on him in the last 12 months or two years?
if you hadn't had the 41 matches in a row going into the semifinal with roger at the french, do you think you would have had more chance to win that match?
do you think to form a union of the tennis players is good for the sport of tennis?
your first match, grand slam match, with russia next to your name. are you still getting used to that?
how were the conditions out there?
your offseason preparation, how did that go? what did you do?
a 28yearold coming to this tournament seeded for the first time, do you feel like now it's a matter of keeping the momentum going?
you tweeted earlier this week you would favor a strike. what specific conditions concern you, and what do you feel about what's happened in the past couple of days?
are you talking scheduling, prize money?
you said you were inspired by how people felt at the meeting. what do you think it's going to take to see real concrete action? is it going to take one or two of the elite players coming out and being more forceful in this or a collective response?
you're talking about forming a proper union for the players?
how likely do you think it is there will be a strike? you mentioned in your tweet it could even be here.
have you looked into playing at the olympics? is that a possibility?
have you been meeting with your russian teammates here? have you talked to them at all about the upcoming tie?
are you at peace with the usta at this point?
any lingering feelings of having to pay them back?
you don't feel it was unfair?
do you expect that to be carried out for anybody else who did the same thing?
can you talk a little bit about how the match got away after the first two sets.
was it the heat or you had a stomachache or both?
he said at the start of the third set he tried to trick you by making you think his body language was down and he was beaten.
were you actually physically sick when you went off court?
when you left the court, were you actually physically sick?
during the match, when you left the court.
you said out on court you didn't know how you did it. a couple minutes later, can you give us an answer?
are you a little worried what might happen when you do get fit?
it was an extraordinary match, so many ups and downs. the way eventually you took it was like a very mature player.
how much are you training? we've seen pictures of you running on treadmills after you've played threesetters and things like that.
will you be doing that here?
what was the thought process on the last point before you pulled the trigger?
were you disappointed to be playing in the afternoon rather than at night?
if you had the choice over again, a secondround match, would you be looking at night?
when you're in a match like this, can you draw on anything in the past, or are you so much into the match that all you can consider is the opponent in front of you?
do you think you showed people something about yourself that they might not have known today?
was there any time in the match when his body language showed you something that you focused on?
so you set him up a little bit?
the idea of being a bigmatch player, how much of that is in you and how much of that is something you can learn as you go along and adapt to the situation?
how much of that is in you as opposed to something you're picking up as you go?
compared to that wimbledon match, you didn't get the overnight break you got there and conditions hotter here, so how much better is this win for you than that one?
what did you learn from your last grand slam appearance against cilic in new york?
just about the temperament.
how much of the expectation of the aussie public do you come in contact with? you get journalists asking you to do interviews. but in your daily life, do aussies come up to you and talk to you about what it would mean to them for you to do well?
other players in sydney talked about the experience they feel playing before australian crowds. is there any pressure, especially when you were 2love down?
you talked about the crowd helping you out. you're not necessarily someone who interacts with the crowd and shows a lot of emotion. does that feel like a disconnect for you?
have you had a standing ovation before?
did you watch lleyton when you were growing up playing these afternoon matches here doing his warrior routine?
have you learnt, being around lleyton in davis cup? have you taken something onboard from him?
how did you feel out there today?
do you feel like you should have scheduled some more matches before you got here?
can you take us through your offseason, how you prepared physically.
did you put on any weight?
must be exciting heading into 2012?
what did you focus on tenniswise since you had a better chance to train in the offseason?
what did you change?
your next match could be nalbandian. talk about him and the dangers he presents.
what was your take on the players' meeting, the issues that are swirling around right now?
everything fine, moving okay, twingefree?
yes. everything good?
good day to play at night probably because of the heat.
i'm sure you would have been made aware of some of the things that rafael nadal said in here yesterday. you could call it criticism of you, perhaps. certainly the comments were quite outspoken. in those circumstances, do you have any response to what i'm sure you've been told he said?
it's fair to say you have differing views in terms of what should happen.
he said you've got one view and the others have got something else.
specifically are you willing to talk about the point that possibly you sometimes stand outside the process, maybe not getting behind some of the top 100 players, or does that come back to the differences in points of view, for example, pushing for changes to prize money, things like that?
do you disagree with the concept of a strike in principle, or do you just think it wouldn't work?
there seemed to be so many mentions of so many different issues, bits of this issue here, that issue there, prize money, davis cup, whatever. how important is it that there is one argument from the players' point of view?
just one, a consistent view. is that important, in your opinion?
you ask 10 players, you might get 10 different issues raised.
is it perhaps taking it too far to say this could be potentially a defining year in the relationship between the players, the tournaments, the grand slams?
do you feel extra pressure coming to this tournament since it's been a while since you won a grand slam, almost two years?
it was hard to get a read on where that match was going a lot of the time. i want to get your thoughts on what the crucial turning points were.
could you maybe try and explain to people what it's like being at the other end of the court from a guy who covers it so phenomenally well as novak does and the problems that causes you every point.
andre agassi said at the final ceremony in houston in 2003, roger, i inspire from you. i think that was his motivation, andre. now you are 31. i think you have reached agassi's position. who do you inspire from right now?
you mentioned on the court you couldn't have played that much better. you played many finals at this event. would you say, qualitywise, this was one of the highest quality finals you've played in this event?
can i ask you about the offseason? the offseason is longer this year, in response to the feeling that the season was too long, players were getting injured, tired, et cetera. quite a few players, yourself included, are playing some exhibition matches during the offseason. does that in any way go against that the offseason should be longer to protect player's health?
when you were winning your original masters cups and these kinds of titles, we were talking about being attacking tennis being to the fore. now we're talking about defensive tennis as the norm. would you like to see or could you see a day when we talk more about attacking tennis than defensive tennis?
do you think you would still be playing if you didn't have these great rivals playing at such a high level and pushing you?
sometimes from the outside we see the match differently from the players. you were attacking all the time, very aggressive. 30 winners against 18. but 42 errors against 28. 24 were forehand errors. do you think that is because you were trying so much to take initiative, you were taking so many risks and chances that at the end, you were missing more? you made four forehand mistakes when you were up 54, 4015. for you, it's very uncommon. i've never seen you miss so many forehands. were you tired a little bit in the second set or not?
it was the last competitive match of the season. how do you reflect on 2012? what are your goals for the new year?
what are your expectations to finish your season in sao paulo in brazil?
tremendous season and a win at the finals. can i take you back to last year when you got to no.1. you didn't have to win that wimbledon final against nadal, but you have to prove to yourself and to the world you are the no.1. tonight was a similar scenario. how satisfying is all this for you?
after about eight minutes you were 3love down, roger was playing great tennis. what was going through your mind to turn it around?
among the more than 80 games you played this year, where would you rate the level of this one?
can you describe the feeling of finishing the most incredible year with the most incredible shot.
when you talk about points like that last one, are those things that just don't happen in tournaments where you're physically a little bit jaded or your motivation isn't as high?
did you ever question yourself, whether you could back to back no.1's? having done it, can you give us some idea of the sense of achievement that you've backed it up?
you won without losing a match. do you think you made roger anxious, to try to hit so much, too much, because he made so many mistakes with the forehand? do you think it was your patience?
can you give us some interesting details on your holiday plans. pierre has been here with you. will he get any bonus?
you mentioned your father just now. i know you've been reluctant to talk about his health. at this stage, can you tell us any more about how he is now?
it was a fitting finale. how do you reflect on 2012 and what are your hopes and aspirations for the new season?
roger said the other day he would prefer a bestoffive for the last match of the season. what are your thoughts on that?
talk a little bit about your vacation. you are going to brazil in a few days. you are scheduled to play football. i would like to know if you're good in football and if you can play like petkovic and if you have any brazilian hero in football?
i know you like italy very much. you support ac milan. italian people love you very much. what is your relationship with italy? will you go soon?
considering the expectations you had coming into this season, some of the offcourt problems that you mentioned with your family, then the fact you finished this season much more strongly than you thought, do you think you'll look back at this season being more satisfying than 2011?
how much are you looking forward to the rivalry with rafa and seeing if you can reverse it back in your favor?
were you at all disturbed by what appeared to be an interruption from the crowd when you doublefaulted in the first set?
i can't rightly remember. the umpire gave a warning to the crowd, asked them to be silent during the serve. it was when you doublefaulted.
no.
you've repeatedly referred to him as the greatest player that ever played the game. that was an exhibition of it tonight in that second set particularly, wasn't it?
talking about the fact that you got off to a very good start, then he came back, was there anything specific he did or did your level drop?
obviously a lot of superb achievements this year. how much of a downer is it to finish like that?
given all the things that have happened this year that have been very positive.
what do you think is the biggest improvement you made this year, the improvement you're most pleased with? what's the improvement you want to concentrate on making next year?
there's obviously huge affection for roger federer in this country with everything he's done. were you at all taken aback by how much support there was for him tonight, given this is your home tournament?
i believe you're going back to abu dhabi. i want to know why you decided to go back after missing it? does it really help your standard going into the new season or is it just an exhibition for you?
just looking at the last two months since the us open, you've had some pretty good results in that period, but you haven't quite reached the heights that you did in the summer. has that been just difficult matching what you did in those sort of two months over the middle of the summer?
ivan has obviously made a big difference. would you say working with him is the best decision you've made in your career?
how decisive do you think the first set was moving into the second?
you are used to playing everywhere with a lot of people cheering for you. did you expect something like that also here in london? are you surprised? you were playing against a british guy, scottish guy.
we were surprised. were you?
can you remember the last match where you didn't feel you had a lot of support?
your net game seemed particularly effective tonight, especially compared with yesterday. did you tweak anything or did it click into place?
talking about that match, facing novak djokovic, how would you evaluate the final?
you just mentioned you slept this morning till 11. given the fact that novak was done eight hours ago, how do you manage your day tomorrow and make up for that deficit?
just speaking about matchups. you look at the other three guys out of the top four. you have the best record against novak. what is it about playing him that maybe you feel more comfortable compared to rafa or andy?
novak set the bar pretty high at the press conference. he gave us chocolates. any lindt chocolates or rolex watches for us?
what sets novak apart? is it the return? the intensity? the depth of his shots? the ability to counterattack?
about the atp world tour finals, you are the world champion indoor. the other is no.1 in the world. what counts more?
no.1 in the atp rankings, djokovic is going to be no.1 regardless of what happens tomorrow, and you could be the atp champion indoor. they're two different things.
i'm saying, what is more important?
you played a couple effective chipandcharge points. is that a shot that gives you a particular pleasure, a shot that has almost disappeared from tennis?
in these days in the atp, the professional players playing at the atp, apart from the physical strength, are very tall. from your point of view, is that a disadvantage, not being that tall? you and david are 180. is this a disadvantage?
there are not too many.
you seemed to be feeling better. what was motivating you tonight to keep going?
how would you evaluate your year overall and what are your goals for next year?
you made it to the quarterfinals of the us open, semifinals in canada. those are the two big achievements. you won a clay court title. other than those things, which matches of the year are you proudest of?
how do you feel physically going into the match tomorrow in the semis? any problems?
i know we shouldn't build up too much to two defeats in two weeks. is there something about his game you find difficult to deal with?
what in your estimation was the difference today? can you also talk about the management of his serve in the last set. i don't think you got more than one point on any of his service games.
do you think the players who are resting today will have an advantage going into tomorrow? would you prefer to play the second match to have the extra time tomorrow?
22 times the atp finals have been won by a player who lost a match in the round robin, and 12 players won it altogether. you have been playing many finals. do you see any difference when you won it having lost one match in the round robin or having won it when you didn't lose any match in the round robin? does it make any difference in terms of confidence, psychological impact, or nothing?
we don't know who you will play tomorrow yet, but there's a good chance it will be andy.
you played andy a few times this year, some big matches with him. it's been a big year for him. how do you think his game has changed since you first played him five or six years ago?
having already qualified, do you think at all before or during the match, okay, if i win, i play murray, if i lose, there's a chance i might play djokovic? does that come into the mind at all?
you touched on it briefly, but do you feel a bit of sympathy for david ferrer?
quite an odd situation for a player.
a lot of people would suggest that andy murray's season and his career took off when he won the olympic gold medal on the same court you had beat him only three weeks earlier. having reflected on that, why was he able to win that gold medal against you in a fashion which perhaps surprised most of us?
why three weeks after you'd won the wimbledon title murray could come out.
i appreciate that.
can you clarify what you were saying on court, what you were aware that you needed to do tonight, what ivan said to you before going out.
would you have preferred not to have known?
is that the first time you met muamba?
he's a pretty inspirational guy?
if i recall rightly, it's again the possibility of djokovic and federer, like shanghai and like the olympics. is the prospect of that something you can take in your stride now that you've done it on quite a few occasions?
who is your favorite for the davis cup final?
indoor hard.
i think roger only has lost one match indoors in the last two seasons. do you consider him to be the best player indoors at the moment?
the other day i saw a funny video from back when you were at the sanchez academy where you were saying your forehand was your best shot, and your coach was saying your backhand was your best shot. can you make an assessment on that kind of improvement, what you have been doing differently?
do you agree on what ljubicic says, that djokovic indoors doesn't seem as good as the djokovic outdoors? if you had to play federer, assuming that he won seven times wimbledon on grass, you beat him on grass, but he's so strong also indoors, where is federer better, in your opinion? if you have to play federer, you would like to play him with more chances on grass again or indoor?
will you watch the match tomorrow? do you have a preference at all as to who you face on sunday?
the top 10 seems to have been fairly stable over the last couple of years. what names would you say might be threatening to break into that elite crowd next season?
do you get the impression this week that the season is taking its toll on the quality of tennis?
well, that it's maybe not as high a level as it might be in some of the earlier matches.
you said when you arrived that you felt basically as tired as the other years. but it seems like winning a match, winning two matches has given you energy.
he put up a bit of a fight in the end, but then you won five points in a row. what exactly do you do to flip the switch like that?
you stood in the court for the homage to juan carlos ferrero. what are your thoughts?
given roger federer's record here the last couple of years, do you think he deserves to be regarded as the favorite and the main man to beat here this week?
it's been a difficult few weeks for your family. what would it mean for them for you to win here?
you mentioned juan carlos ferrero being kind to you when you were coming up on tour. are there players you see four or five years younger on tour now that we might be seeing in london soon?
how hard has it been to focus this week, given your father?
how is he?
you came onto the tour pretty young. what we've been seeing is that the average age, we don't see youngsters anymore, we seldom see a teenager in the top 100. is there an explanation?
you were just talking about tomic, the aspect of you being mentored by somebody like juan carlos. have you spoken to bernie in recent weeks following all the issues that he's had off court?
janko tipsarevic said earlier in the week he wouldn't be surprised if you didn't win all four grand slams next year. he says he also gets the impression that you want to be world no.1 forever and ever and over. can you give us an idea of how much intensity you have for the game, your desire to keep on winning and dominating?
obviously you had your chances there in the second set. what was your assessment of the match?
how did you feel about your level overall in the tournament? how do you feel this is going to carry into the davis cup?
in spain the people talk about the surface in the davis cup. how do you think the surface is important to the final?
how would you rate overall novak's performance today? do you think he has a game that's good enough to win the tournament?
for the davis cup, is it helpful to have these tough matches and tough opponents even if you lose, or is it hard to go into a big tournament when maybe your confidence isn't as high as it would be if you had been winning?
it's never nice to ask questions to someone who has just lost, because it's embarrassing for everyone. can you tell us what has been the best moments of this year? this is the end of the year. when have you been more satisfied and proud about yourself?
in the first set it seemed that you were still a little ill. at least the second set was a good effort, a good match.
how would you summarize your first two matches?
this is a pop quiz. true or false: this year staying in the top 10 was more difficult than last year getting to the top 10?
yes.
not many players use glasses in the court. how is that system? i remember navratilova?
your match against ferrer at the us open was both one of the best matches i think, most people agree, at the tournament.
and also one of your best matches this year, despite the outcome. that match showcased that you have a number of similarities in your game and you have the shared achievement of 20plus wins on both hard and clay court.
but he has seven titles this year.
he's not doing better than you against the top four, so there are some similarities there. what i want you to do is pretend for a moment that you're a tennis journalist and give us an analysis.
give us an analysis of what he does better than you do physically and maybe mentally on court.
it's your second year in the tournament. just wanted your overall view on it this season, how it compared to last year.
you lost two close sets to roger federer today. how do you reflect on the match overall?
what is it about his game that makes it so difficult? you played 14 times. you're playing so well at the moment. you still can't quite beat him.
you made a very good start with a 30 lead. what happened next? was it his game or yours?
at the beginning of the match.
this is a question you answered a lot for 10 days, but how do you feel physically right now?
you've already beaten juan martin del potro. you now play janko tipsarevic next. how do you approach this game?
you have lost every game against roger. how is it to go on the court with him? do you have the stat in your head?
is it in the back of your mind that if you reached the final here, you would go above rafa in the rankings. is that anything you think about?
if rafa was around and you managed to get above him, would it mean something to you then? or the ranking does not make a difference?
you're the first player that qualified for the semifinals. could you give us your assessment of today's match, and also summarize what makes this tournament so special for you.
talking about the match, david said today he didn't get many first serves in, but the second serve is much better. so you're improving every week.
the second serve. he said he had chances to break, but your second serve was difficult.
can you talk about playing indoors. i think the last two years you've lost one match on an indoor hard court. what is it about playing indoors? is it just the obvious, that there's no variables of wind, temperature, et cetera?
if someone sees a child grow every single day, one doesn't have the notion of the changes. the point is, you work on your tennis on a daily basis.
do you have the notion you've been doing something really different than when you started playing this tournament? in 2006, i was imagining the forehand dropshot. used to be more of a purist on the serve, going to the lines. now you're going more towards the body. what kind of changes can you tell us you've been doing?
the other day, ivan ljubicic started to be a tv broadcaster for italian tv. he said djokovic is no.1 in the world, but he's not the no.1 in the world when you play indoors. do you agree with that more or less? do you think he's right? the second thing is, when ferrer had all those breakpoints in the first set, did you ever think that he could come out of the court saying, nobody is going to beat david ferrer 14 times in a row?
with your atp president's cap on, do you have any reaction to this quite strange decision to turn down the offer of extra prize money at indian wells at the time when the players are trying to pressure the grand slams into upping the money?
this tournament is going to be played here for the next three years. after, would you agree with a rotating system in terms of surfaces, one year clay court, one year hard court open air? would this be more fair for the players?
stefan edberg was your idol growing up. receiving a sportsman award yesterday, i think it means a lot to you. are you proud of this?
could you reflect on david's schedule, playing four weeks in a row, two titles, this event, and the davis cup final next week. how impressive is that?
you pushed novak djokovic all the way today. where do you feel the key moments were?
you played so well in the first set. it seemed to change a bit in the second set. how crucial was it you not getting that breakpoint you had early in the set?
when you play novak now, is there almost like a different dynamic to when you play anybody else?
you can obviously still go through to the semifinals. do you like the round robin format?
but does it affect in any way the way you play when you're out there on the court, the fact you can lose and still go through?
you played today 31 games. only five games went to deuce. when you lost your serve three times, you always lost it either to 15 or to 30. do you think there is a reason why when you lose your serve, either you go down love40 or 1540?
would you rather play tsonga in a straight fight for the second semifinal spot?
does it make it different if the scenario is not quite so straightforward? is it harder mentally?
you chose to servevolley on a big breakpoint. is that an offthecuff decision or something you discussed with ivan maybe on a big point, this is a good thing to do?
the tournament is going to stay here until the end of 2015, an extension of two years. you obviously wanted it to stay here. can you comment on the length of time, what it means for you for it to be here?
you and novak have similar games, similar strengths. do you sometimes have the feeling you play against yourself or do you see big differences in your games?
i presume when you beat someone like novak, who is the world no.1, that is the most satisfying win you can have. but even though he's the toughest guy in a way to beat, does it hurt more losing to him now than losing to anyone else?
your friendship and rivalry with djokovic is one of the most talked about things in tennis. after a close defeat either way, how long before you're back practicing and joking with each other?
the two breakpoints you saved at the beginning of the third were obviously a key moment of the match.
it explains why he forgot to change his seat on the changeover after the first game.
many of the players that are playing the davis cup final are here. is it too much or you are used to it?
going into the final match with novak, is it quite tough going in knowing you could win and still go out or you could win a set and go through, the mathematics involved, or do you focus on the match?
did you watch his match today? do you have in mind a certain way you feel you can hurt him?
players right now have managers, coaches, physios. you don't have any accountant that can help you for calculations? you're not going to hire somebody to tell you, that's enough, you're already in?
you're still young, but it's been a while since you won at bercy. what would you say was the shot that you improved the most or the area of your game you improved the most since then?
i want to know if you heard about the atp vote on indian wells prize money and if you had an opinion on that?
yes. but the atp may not be going along with it.
thinking of prague again for a second, did you watch any of the fed cup last weekend? can you take any inspiration from the fact that the czech women won the title?
you are not new in the masters cup, but roger also is not new. what is your opinion of the first match?
because of roger's headtohead against other people in group b, a tennis writer as a joke renamed the two groups group blood bath and group pillow fight. so your perspective on the matchups in group b?
you're dealing with a medical situation. we've seen federer, who is 31. if he goes next year, he'll tie the record for most consecutive grand slams. can you talk about his durability? is he lucky? how is he able to maintain that kind of excellence year in and year out?
can you talk a little bit about the scheduling issue, especially since roger has been careful about scheduling, taking time off, so on. you talked a little bit about that the other day. could you elaborate on your thinking for next year.
your illness is a cold, fever? do you have time to recover in 24 hours?
a question about novak. obviously he had a spectacular season last year. did you expect him to be able to maintain the no.1 ranking this year? how would you characterize what he did this year versus what he did last year?
can you give us your thoughts on tonight's win.
it looked like you were playing a little closer to the baseline tonight than you've done in previous years here. have you made tactical changes to your game indoors this year?
your next match is against roger federer. what are your thoughts on this match?
you won against djokovic, murray, but never against federer. what makes his game so difficult for you to play against?
you were still playing on sunday when everyone else was here. is that a disadvantage for you or is it good because you have that winning run coming in here?
do you remember the very first match you played in the atp masters?
do you remember were you nervous? what were your feelings? did you ever think you would have this run of 40?
how much are you feeling the benefit of taking a week off last week?
10 years in a row as the fan favorite. is that a great record, just like all your other records? what do you think made you there?
obviously wimbledon was a big breakthrough for you in 2003. houston, that year, i think you went undefeated without dropping a set. what role did that particular yearend championship play?
yes. your own sense of where you were as a player in the game.
you seemed to strike your rhythm very quickly today. is that an indication of how consistently the court is playing with previous years, or is it more to do with your own confidence?
every time we talk about your records, it seems to me you can remember a match 10 years ago very easily, opponent, score, details. you have played more than one thousand matches. do you just have a good memory in general or very good in tennis?
remember in 2009 here...
do you remember the match against juan martin del potro?
what is better for you, to play against juan martin del potro in the second round or the third round three years ago?
you have a very good memory. we know you're very good on the tennis court. we know you're very articulate. is there anything you don't do well? what are you not good at?
you have in a couple weeks an exhibition in south america. what do you know about brazil, argentina and colombia. i'm not talking about sport, but what do you know about the countries?
you mentioned earlier about the match against ferrero. he retired this year. andy roddick retired this year. who knows how long lleyton hewitt might go on for. you seem to be fresh as a daisy. what goes through your mind when you see your contemporaries fall by the wayside and here you are still playing?
you defended a lot of things in your career. what does defending a yearend no.1, how does that stack up?
tomas said he felt the turning point was when he didn't take those breakpoints in the second set. did you feel as well that was maybe when the momentum shifted?
what was it like being in front of london fans today? what are your overall thoughts on the group pairing as well?
first match on uk soil since becoming a grand slam champion. did that mean anything to you? was there anything different about it?
when you finally got your break in the second set, you had just wasted three more breakpoints, then you whacked the ball, it hit the corona sign on the net. what was going through your mind after missing the breakpoints, then you couldn't hit the ball to the ball boy over the net?
you mentioned on court the situation a couple years ago when you were tired and didn't qualify because there were tiebreaks. that situation can arise in these kinds of events. is that something that comes to your mind, winning in straight sets? losing a game here can actually mean something. is that something you have to keep in your mind when you're playing?
you seemed in the last game very fired up to win that. were you aware, thinking about not having closed out a couple of matches recently?
do you feel any different in yourself or your game having won the grand slam? do you feel it has an impact on a daytoday basis, even in tight moments?
janko tipsarevic told us before he thinks it's the nicest tournament of the whole year. can you talk a little bit about the little special things that make this tournament special for the players.
you're in novak's group. you've obviously had some incredible matches against him this year. given the amount you put each other through each time you play each other, do you have to prepare yourself mentally any differently to just get ready for the pain you're going to put each other through physically?
how do you feel the indoor surface compares to playing to other tournaments around the world?
yes.
(indiscernible) shoes.
you were stumbling a little bit more than usual. was it the shoes, the surface or you were diving for things?
can you give us your assessment of tonight's victory and your views of facing andy murray?
you've had a lot of really exhausting matches against andy. does the fact that it's round robin change the mindset at all?
you had some pretty slow serves in the first set. does it mean something? you were quite annoyed by something?
how would you compare your physical condition today compared to last week in paris?
how much personal satisfaction do you take in ending the year again as world no.1?
you actually practiced with andy murray last saturday. in the tournament with round robin format, do you try to avoid practicing with the players in the same group? is that a concern?
the last few years we've seen you in this room looking pretty wiped out, tired at the end of the year. you look fresh at the moment. i know you just won your match. do you feel different this year?
you also won the atp humanitarian award today. how does that figure alongside your tennis achievements and awards?
is that a match that you felt slipped away a little bit after you started so well?
in the last week or so building up to what is a big couple of weeks in your career, is it possible for you at all to ignore the fact that you've got the davis cup next week? have you been able to simply focus on this week?
you've been in this situation before i think last year when you lost early, were able to come back and qualify for the semifinals. what is the thinking in your mind right now?
were you expecting any more kind of volume of support for andy from london? it seemed reasonably quiet in the arena.
andy has missed a few match points in his last tournaments. he started missing breakpoints today. was that something you were aware of, that he might start getting a bit nervous on the bigger points as he kept missing them?
that was a very tough opponent and a very long week for you. was it too much maybe today?
you could before chosen between a challenger in geneva and quallies here in paris. what final decide you to play the quallies?
let's talk about the winner today, david ferrer. people say he's not as good as djokovic and murray, etcetera. what is so outstanding about his game and why he won today? what can you say about what's so special for this game?
in i think nine days will be your birthday and you have a check of 235,000 euros. can we imagine a good party back home?
what will you be doing in the offseason in terms of training and preparation for the next year?
now that you will be in the top 30 starting for next season, have you thought about the schedule, what is going to change or what you want to have in 2013?
the schedule, have you thought, okay, i'm going to be seeded now maybe even more than before. what is going to change in your player's life?
no. what do you think is going to change, because you're going top 30, to be top 30.
actually, ferrer, he says he thinks you will be or have the ability to be top 10. were your ambitions higher than that, top 10, top 5?
yesterday you talked about your routines that you have been keeping all week, keeping them all the same, mentioning the dirty old bag. you will now keep new bags? will you throw those bags away or will you keep them as a memory of this week?
you said that this week was a dream for you, but in your opinion, what did you learn during this week?
yeah.
just after you won the match point, you collapsed to the ground. i mean, does this tournament have such a big meaning for you? what's the meaning of this victory for you in your career?
you know, you're the first spanish player to win here. are you surprised by that? are you proud of that?
how important is it also for you to move ahead of federer now with seven titles this year?
can you talk maybe about how you were feeling on the court today against janowicz? were you feeling the pressure? are you happy about the way you played?
as you said on the court, you are 30 years old. you have played with two generation of players. so what do you think about janowicz? he's really a rising champion? your impression?
in a couple of days you are playing in london. can you talk about the challenge that it is to win here and project yourself for the masters?
obviously you have to move to london very quickly, but will you have a little time tonight to celebrate? how do you plan to celebrate this big occasion?
congratulations. often when you're on the court we feel you're playing a very intelligent tennis, that you're very calm, and you did that today a lot with berdych and it paid off.
how did you feel today? because on your second serve when you were trying to kick it, you had little problems?
and you were also very calm. you don't talk on the court anymore.
the fact that you don't give any rhythm to your opponent, is it a tactical decision, or is it because you have physical difficulties?
you have no coach right now. does that change something when you prepare a match? how do you feel with that?
you had a day's rest yesterday. i guess it was profitable, so physically you feel better?
it's new for you to have good results and shine in france. how does that feel?
i meant in paris.
so you have beaten four top 20 players in a row. it's getting pretty easy.
was it obvious to you before the medical timeout that something was not quite right with janko?
i think the crowd have got a bit of a new hero, but it will turn a little bit tomorrow when you play gilles. do you think you're going to have to be a little bit mentally prepared in a slightly quieter atmosphere if you're doing what you did today again tomorrow against simon?
last night did you manage to find sleep easily after beating murray? what time did you go to bed? what about tonight? will that be easy for you to go to bed?
you were emotional at the end of this match. can you explain what that means for you to be in the semifinal? what is the feedback you had from family or sponsor or anything after your run here?
so you are in semifinal, polish player. is it big news in your country? how popular is tennis in your country?
you said obviously you played in davis cup with a 5,000 crowd against you. you say you're very mentally tough. can you explain where that comes from, your mental toughness?
are you going to play lotto?
so what is your experience of this week? it's a bit strange, isn't it?
what did you have this morning? we heard your neck was hurting, and maybe he retired before you did.
is it the first time you have so much luck in one single tournament?
why don't you want to talk about what you have, what's hurting?
who would you like to play next round on this surface?
you will be among the seeded players in australia if you win this tournament.
do you feel good on this surface? does it suit your game?
do you believe you are improving, that things are getting better? are you confident for next year?
are the conditions different on court no.1?
can you give us details about your opponent's game, his strengths and weaknesses?
did you watch a video of his game?
but did you hit in practice with him?
you were long coming here after your match. did you have treatment during all that time?
how many treatments?
what did you like in your game for that match? the serve?
i believe this is your best paris masters so far. are you thinking ahead, or did you believe you could do that before?
the time you take for treatment, does this reduce the time you spend on the court for practice?
do you believe your tennis is all right and you don't need to practice anymore?
well played. 6love 2love, what do you think about your chances then?
you said you were going to hit your forehand; you hit your forehand, huh?
did you feel he wasn't 100% on the other end?
going into the match he said he was concerned he wouldn't be able to maintain his energy all the way through in the second set. he said he found that his energy he was struggling in every game with his energy levels. so did you get a sense of that at all, because you must have felt that maybe the game was coming round and you might have a chance of doing something special?
obviously serving is a big part of your game, but in the eighth game you saved five break points and served three aces in a row. you must have been delighted with your performance there.
when you do get close to a win against novak, i mean, so many people have been close to a win against novak and he is better than anybody probably at suddenly turning it around. was that in your mind at all?
have you had a look at the draw? do you think you could make a good run at it? you take out particularly the top seed it opens the draw for you. what are your thoughts going forward?
overall, that was a quite solid performance for an first match after shanghai.
what do you know about janowicz?
with djokovic very much outside the tournament and federer and nadal not here, too, you're certainly the favorite. do you feel that way? what do you think are your chances to win here?
how would you assess your shape at this stage of the season? are you still fresh mentally or physically? how would you assess this level?
coming to a city like this as a grand slam champion, has there been anything different maybe sort of on your travels around the hotel or anything like that?
it was a strange match. we felt it was quite uneven. there was this tiebreaker, and then you felt better?
you have incredible statistics in the first set. when did you lose the match?
are you disappointed?
when you played him before, did he play that well?
when you saw the draw, did you have hopes?
well, you might go to london as a substitute.
if you're a second substitute, are you going to go?
so if the season now is really finished, what would you like to do?
if you had one regret for this year, what would it be?
i have a question about your relationship, if you had any, with dr. luis garcia del moral. have you ever met him? how did you work with him? do you still work with him?
on the same matter, is it annoying to you, frustrating for you, to have those questions about dr. luis garcia del moral given what we know about lance armstrong and everything? what do you feel about the way tennis is related to the question?
just on the same subject, you said you know he has worked with some players. is that with some other tennis players?
but do the spanish players talk about the subject?
we have spoken to lots of players about the subject of drugs in tennis. what do you think about it? do you think there are some tennis players who may take drugs or is it a big problem for tennis?
with regard to your form, the way you're playing, you've had a long season and played a lot matches, but this is still an important time of year for you with london coming up. how do you feel about your whole year and how do you feel about next week?
do you have your schedule set for your offseason? how are you going to rest and practice? where are you training in the winter?
yes.
will you have time for a holiday?
just on your schedule, david, my friends in new zealand tell me that you're going to go back and play the auckland event that you've won three times. can you just tell me about that and why you enjoy playing that tournament?
in auckland.
do you ever consider playing another event? you're a regular in auckland. you come there most years.
completely nontennis question: who would you vote for for the golden ball, you know, the football?
because?
it's no doubt for you?
there is no hesitation for you at all or no doubt for you at all?
and if you had to pick two other players?
you said this has been a good year. has this been, do you think, the best year of your career?
and physically you play a lot of the matches. does it get more difficult or do you...
after the first eight games  you were hitting it so well. what turned it around, do you think?
what was wrong with you? are you feeling unwell or sick? you say losing energy.
do you regret coming here at all?
i hope i'm not talking out of place here, but there are some reports from home saying your father has been unwell but getting better. is that one of the things that's been difficult for you?
regarding london, do you think you're going to be 100% mentally and physically playing london, or is it too much right now?
have you been told by your medical people that you should be 100% by the time london comes around?
you said you have had to deal with some things in the last couple of weeks. i think you arrived here on wednesday last week, wasn't it?
things have changed presumably in the last few days, haven't they?
you said you have had to deal with things in the last week, but i would have thought you would not have arrived so early if you had things you had to deal with.
do you think, just for the credibility of the sport, that we just do need to look at this end of the season and reflect again as to whether a tournament as big as this should be the week before a tournament as big as the world finals?
i'm going to ask you again because the sound didn't work for tvs. what happened in this game? can you repeat? sorry. just because it didn't work.
just for fact checking, we want to be accurate in our reporting. can you tell us about when you left paris? we understand you traveled by plane back to serbia. when did you come back to paris?
was the frustration of losing the first set too difficult to put behind you for the rest of the match?
how could you make it difficult for him in the beginning of the match?
at the end when you came out of the court we saw you had a few words with lionnel about the challenge, i guess.
you are not the first victim of bercy. many other players have been booed here, like nadal.
you had a warning that is normally extremely rare.
it's funny?
a question about the schedule. is it over for you or are you going to play the interclubs' competitions?
strange match today. you saw he was injured. the second set was tougher. how did you manage the situation.
how do you feel playing indoors again? remember, we talked about it. do you like it or not?
but do you like indoors?
what is the problem with indoors for you?
raonic next round. what do you think?
you're talking about indoors, but what are your last memories of this tournament here?
are you thinking about djokovic already?
but what happened to you? you almost retired.
a followup to the former question. didn't this happen before tokyo?
do you have a record against canadian players?
i have a question that has nothing to do with your match. what do you think about the new rules that the atp is going to implement in the beginning of the year, the let, etcetera?
and the let thing?
among all the victories that helped you increase your ranking, is there a particular match that you remember that was really good for you?
and against tsonga?
a year ago here you said that you were leaving the fontan era behind you.
that was a huge match. maybe on break points you were not realistic enough.
could you explain what happened at the end of the third set at 3all? what was the problem with the umpire?
do you remember that final in beijing? jowilfried tsonga said the same thing. it was djokovic playing then. he said if it hadn't been djokovic, the umpire wouldn't have made that decision.
what do you think of the surface or the balls? they say it's slow.
and the balls, too?
so how do you assess this season for you? i believe you were frustrated because you were injured in montecarlo because it stopped you. and now you're on holidays after this loss. what do you think?
congratulations for this performance. during the last tournament we saw you having a bit of trouble after the first round. how are you feeling right now?
you had a difficult first round, but now the second round should be easier. the fact of not playing roger, is it a relief, or are you disappointed because of the crowd?
thierry tulasne watched your match. are you happy of that?
are you happy to move on now? do you know what to expect for the following weeks? did you really need to have this break, so to speak?
so the idea is not changing coaches, it's remaining alone?
so how do you practice during the week? is it easy to get organized? how do you do?
what is your state of mind coming into this tournament? just to win a few matches or to go far in the tournament?
you were talking about a next tournament, but they are club competitions. are you going to play them?
did you have time to do medical examinations that are far enough to determine what you have, that you're always injured?
you're almost finishing the year on your best ranking ever. is that a special motivation for the end of the year?
in the beginning of the year you were coming close to top 50 and now you're top 30. do you believe that during tournaments your opponents will be ready for you, or do you believe the public has expectations?
do you feel also special motivation in playing another french player here? maybe against tsonga the crowd will not be on your side.
it's the last tournament of the year and it is in france. does this mean you're just doing your best and think you will be on holidays next week?
talking about jo, you say, oh, he's qualified for the masters; but if you beat him tomorrow and if he doesn't reach the final, i believe you can deprive him from that london masters.
you played a great match in wimbledon this year against federer. what did federer tell you after that match? how did you feel after that match? did you talk about the match together? how did he talk to you?
there will be a lot of curiosity about your next match; for the first time jo will not be alone. can this change the result of the match? because when you have a new [] wife you want to do well.
another word about roger. after a very tiring season, he preferred to withdraw. do you understand this? because the organizers here were counting on him. maybe if the season is that long players are going to get fed up.
you said that other players get to know players on the second year they are on the tour. what do you think about raonic? it's his second year on the tour this year.
are there things you can use against him?
i wanted to have your feeling on this very good year of yours with a lot of emotions. what do you remember about this particular season? wimbledon? the olympic games? what are the best memories of this year?
can you just sum up this experience, as a whole, this tournament?
the speed on your serves yesterday, you hit like 130s, 140s regularly. today judging by the speed gun, 120s, 130s. how much does that affect you when you're playing someone like roger, your serves don't have that kind of bite?
you had opportunities obviously in the tiebreaker. what do you look back on in that tiebreaker?
how do you feel about the top 10?
now that you're in the top 10 and you have had this experience and you're about to go play doubles, nadal is there, 1, 2, 3 for you, what part of your game do you need to hone in on to stay with these guys?
you have so many friends in the game, andy, captain courier, many others. what was the most fun or interesting message that you've gotten this week during your run?
did you feel like you were holding your own from the baseline against roger today?
you had kind words for coach manny diaz yesterday. do you keep in touch with him often?
you're in final in singles and final in doubles. if you keep going deep in tournaments in singles and keep playing doubles, it's gonna take some toll on you. i mean, what kind of plans do you have for your doubles commitments and for the rest of the season?
i guess the obvious question, maybe the only question, what is it like to face that serve?
i would think it's also tough to get rhythm when he's basically trying to hit winners off his forehand off the ground all the time.
you have played a lot of the big servers obviously. what is it about isner's game that's made him able to rise into the top 10 now that brings him above the rest?
when you played him the last time, was he volleying as well as he did today? didn't seem like he missed too many tough volleys today, either.
talk about the lobs a little bit. you won two pretty amazing points off of lobbing over if not the tallest, one of the tallest guys out there. what's going through your head when you take a shot like that?
turning point of the last tiebreaker was the return he hit on 42. can you just talk about that one point.
how do you look ahead to miami after today?
what does it feel like to try and return that guy's serve?
from a tactical point of view, did he do anything that surprised you? did it go as you expected it would go? because he managed to hold off quite well on the rallies.
when a match is as close as that  as you say, it could have gone either way  how long does it take you to get over a loss like this one in such a big event at such an important stage of the tournament?
when a guy is hitting his serve that big, do you turn around look at the scoreboard to see what it was, or do you try to avoid doing that? do you look for the speed of it?
for the fans, this is basically a fantasy semifinal day for two reasons: one, three of the top players in the world; two, an american in the semifinal. can you talk a little bit about how much the crowd does or doesn't affect you when they're so excited about an american player out there?
when you played almagro you had said that he can make shots from all over the court, but you also expected pretty much to wait him out because you knew he was going to make some mistakes. is that similar when you play isner? you know about all the big serves that he will give you, but you also know that you're going to get all kinds of opportunities?
when you play this well  seems like this was your most complete match of the tournament  do you say to yourself, if i play this well i'm not gonna lose; i'm just gonna beat any opponent?
with this run that you've had, there is this feeling that you've pretty much crushed everybody. that's really not the case. you have had unbelievably tough matches, and they've turned in those moments where you really have to be tough. in the past that was a spot where you weren't considered the tough guy. how did you teach yourself that toughness like today, for example? you go 31, you get broken, you come back, break, hold at love, and then the whole game changes.
specifically if you'd go just a touch further, when you're in real trouble, which is relatively rare, but what is your monologue? what are you saying inside yourself? is your mind racing? do you tell yourself, calm down? what tactics are there? what's inside?
as well as you're playing and the fact that you've been doing it for quite some time now, do you still at times surprise yourself with a shot that you might play in a match and think, where did that come from?
away from the match, when you're on change of ends and suddenly you see on the screen an advertisement for head and you on top of a biplane, is that amusing or distracting?
in general, and for yourself, how much of a factor do you think revenge can be in tennis?
revenge as a motivating factor in tennis? how much is it for yourself and for other people in general, do you think?
how much are you in touch with jelena gencic these days?
why is it so long that you hadn't seen her?
that sort of famous moment when you first showed up and it said you had a headband in the bag and everything ready to go, talk about that moment and also how she instilled belief into this little kid.
did you ever think at some point when you were a kid that team sports would fit your personality better, or was the individualism of tennis something that really attracted you?
i understand from tipsarevic that the serbian men's tennis team is going to stay in a house near wimbledon during the olympics. couple quick questions: one, is there anything you'll miss about being in the village, and who is going to be the domacin, the host of that house? will there be any competition over the title of grill master?
he seems to be a very tricky player for some to play, but you seem to do what you want to do with him, more or less.
can you talk about your memories of playing nalbandian here? i think it was three years ago you fought off five match points, and now you'll have him again.
as the competition gets harder for you as the draw goes on, in some ways is it tougher for you to still be in doubles? so you wishthat you had  not that you entered doubles without the intention of winning, but...
you have been around playing roger for so many many, many years. you've also seen him a lot off the court. what have you learned the most tenniswise from federer? what have you learned off the court also from him, from roger?
he improved his backhand; what other thing has roger really improved over these years, would you say?
when you play fellow spanish players, do you have the opinion that they are nervous about playing you, that they may not achieve their best level against you? or do you think they try even harder to beat you than they might other players?
can you comment on today's match against alex, your thoughts, your feelings on how you played and how the match went?
you played djokovic three times at roland garros: 2006, 2007, 2008. he didn't win one set against you. it's a little bit ahead, but if you were to meet him in paris, would you expect a much different kind of match?
when you play with that much tape on your fingers, can you feel the ball or not?
because why?
because of blisters?
tennis is such a grind, so difficult. aside from taking time off, how do you keep a fresh mentality? how do you keep fresh on the circuit?
in the past you have golfed here as a way to relax. have you been able to do that on this trip?
any interesting golf stories?
do you care what your handicap is? does it matter to you or do you use golf to relax?
this tournament has a very special owner, mr.ellison. i think you have had some contacts with him. what are your thoughts about larry ellison?
this week there has been a lot of talk about milos raonic and comparing him to your game. do you see some similarities?
when you go into a match like that, i mean, are you thinking  like everyone talksat this level about that's a match i have to win?
how much does playing doubles keep up your singles matches, if at all? i mean, you're playing them on the same day.
did you do that in college tennis, play doubles and singles in the same day?
is it odd for you being the no.2 american and not being on the center stadium and only playing matches on 2?
being on the verge of top 10, not having yet played on the stadium and having won three matches already?
does it make it harder for you switching in the later rounds?
you're the last american guy in singles, and now you and sam in doubles.
no, he just saved three match points. it's 45 in the second.
how much better a player are you now compared to this time last year?
if ryan pulls it out, can you talk about that matchup? and if not, talk about playing simon.
it's been a while since we have seen a couple of americans at that stage if ryan were to come through, no?
in atp tennis you're out there all by yourself. it's your strokes and your mind. so many big matches. when you're in really tough spots out there, what's the selftalk inside your head? what's the mental process?
is that something you can work on? and also, when your mind is going, hey, you're such a jerk, how do you deal with that?
when you beat mahut at wimbledon you were serving ahead in that final set, and people said that gave you a psychological advantage. do you think there is an advantage to serving first in the final set of a match?
similarly, on tv justin has been talking about how with your serve it builds a pressure in the course of a match for obvious reasons. could you talk about that factor? do you feel that's something that you can sort of impose, i don't know, psychologically on opponents?
if i could ask, there has been so many great players in recent history. but for the fun of it, if you can go back and play just anyone you've never played, any of the legends, who would you single out as a great experience?
how do you think you would do about arguably maybe the best returner...
did that feel slightly like yesterday's match in a different way, losing the first set, breaking to start the second?
can you talk about the experience of playing when you're feeling slightly ill? what goes first? is it the legs? is it the decisionmaking? is it the movement?
also when you really needed it 4all, love30 i think, three, maybe four first serves in a row. that's the weapon coming through when you most need it.
you've won a number of tournaments in your career being a little bit sick. can you remember winning tournaments being a little bit under the weather?
can you just speak to both the possibilities for the next round even though we don't know yet?
del potro or istomin.
you said you're feeling a lot better now. did you ever consider withdrawing from indian wells in previous days?
can you actually recall a tournament when so many people seem to have gone down with something that no one quite knows what it is?
have you taken any special precautions, done anything differently, not eaten something...
with the sickness, all the precautions athletes have to take on what's allowed and what's not allowed with the drug situation, how careful do you have to be, and is it a case if you can't take like full strength medication to get better really fast because of all these restrictions?
maria sharapova once said or recently said that one of the things she was looking forward to when she retires is being able to go to the drugstore, the pharmacy, and just get whatever she wants, so to speak.
does that ring true to you? it's something you just have to pay attention to?
going back to today's match, were you surprised at the level that bellucci was able to play for so long during the match? he sustained a very high level of play?
there are a lot of big forehands in the game. where do you rank del potro's, and what's so deadly about it?
how did you feel about the match today?
with that second set, did you feel you dropped down just a notch, or was it him more lifting?
are you pretty friendly with him? do you know him pretty well? because there was quite an embrace at the end.
when do you think you played your best tennis last year? was there ever a tournament like you were in the zone the whole time?
do you think you are at that same level at the moment? is it still too early in the year to determine if you are playing as well as you say that you did last year?
looking forward a little bit, when do you think you're going to make a decision about davis cup and serbian open, and does it make any difference to your thinking that the czechs have decided to play davis cup on clay?
what's so intriguing to play berdych or stepanek?
have you been in prague?
at the top of the game with you and rafael and roger, you seem to have nadal's you seem to be able to dominate him. nadal seems to be able to dominant federer, and federer and you seem to be the playing the closest matches. do you think right now that is the best matchup in the game, you and federer? how do you see it?
did you see any of roger and milos last night? if you did, what do you think?
what needs to happen in miami for you to go to prague?
seemed like you had a pretty routine match today. obviously it doesn't feel it's easy. what are your thoughts on that?
just an hour. were you watching the tiebreak of federerraonic?
i know you watched the murraygarcialopez match earlier in the tournament. do you watch a lot of matches when you're at a tournament like this?
do you watch women's matches?
do you have a favorite woman's player to watch?
for the fun of it, if you could go back and play any player in the past who you've never played...
borg? connors? who would you like to play?
what do you make of the pace or speed of the court here? would you say it's slow, very slow?
no?
i'm not out there playing unfortunately, but...
looks slow to me.
when you arrive in paris when the cycle comes around for roland garros, what do you feel inside? what is it like just coming to paris in the late spring and being there and the championship of clay court tennis?
do you remember anything when you were first starting, maybe a match, i don't know, court 2 or the bull ring?
no, at roland garros.
the bull ring?
court 1.
if i could, your ability to go from roland garros to grass and wimbledon, is that something that you're particularly proud of that you were able to make that transition in your game and triumph?
after you have taken a break like you did after the australian open, how long does it take you to feel that you are playing at a level that you're totally satisfied with?
and what about alex in the next round dolgopolov?
after not playing matches for a month, how are you feeling physically after a couple of matches under your belt?
gutted out a return game end of both sets. that's gotta feel good, right?
obviously he's gonna make you play a lot of long rallies. looks like you were conscious of hanging in there, waiting for your opportunities. talk about that.
are there times where you feel your serve is not working for you, or is it 99% of the time it's there?
everyone tries to focus on the match ahead, but you probably can't help notice some of the upsets in your quarter of the draw. have you been noticing? what crosses your mind when you see murray lose and mardy lose?
how surprised are you at not playing mardy?
what are your thoughts about playing matt?
sometimes in sports it's sort of a matter of gut feeling and momentum both in tournaments and maybe in careers as a whole. do you feel a gut feeling that you're kind of ready to take it to the next level and get up there?
and if you look at your career, i think it's fair to say that you have had an incredible record in big stage, big tournament matches, from nadal at roland garros and obviously wimbledon, us open, so forth. could you talk about that, your feeling for the stage? did the play in athens help at all?
on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate yourself as a competitor?
speaking of gut feelings, can you tell me if peyton manning will go to the broncos or not? what's your gut feeling on that?
i know you're a big football fan.
who is the better brother, the better player?
do you think you can make it as a tight end or...
how about andy?
obviously against ebden you don't know him that well, but obviously it's a match on paper you're supposed to win. how do you approach that with, you know, going in there as the favorite at this stage of the tournament?
how does that feel? how big a win is that for you?
how do you take on john isner?
seems like you have been making some big strides the last few months. can you just talk about what's going on?
on that hindrance call in the last service game, what do you think happened there? seemed like you reacted right away.
do you think his shouting did interrupt you or distract you during the point?
was this similar to the incident when serena screamed at the us open and it cost her a point against samantha stosur? do you remember that incident?
so he did call out before you made your return?
yes.
who are you here with?
tony has been helping out with you here and there.
i know in a tournament you try to stay focused on your next matches, but when andy lost it seemed to open things up in your quarter. when he lost, what kind of things do you think about and how do you think it does affect some players, too?
i know you're friendly with ryan harrison. how well do you know this whole american group of guys?
could you sense any maybe extra nerves from mardy? he hasn't had a great start to the year. he has a lot of points to defend this year; may be a little bit on edge, figuring this is a match he should get through.
you have seen this avalanche of players from what was once yugoslavia. there are so many names and you're at the top level. why is this happening now?
today's match, even though it was 2 and 3, would you say it was a lot closer than the scoreline indicated?
do you think kevin is far off from maybe knocking on the top 10 door?
you're obviously aware that there has been a bad virus going around here in the last few days. i just got the sense you were maybe struggling a bit out there today. anything to do withyou feeling not 100%.
after that long game 2all in the first, did you feel he had spent a lot of mental energy on that and it was a good opportunity for you to make your run?
you had some problems in australia; you said it might have been because of the flowers, allergies or anything. did you ever sort that out or figure it out?
i thought you did this year.
if you could go back in history, so to speak, and have a fantasy match with any player who you have never faced, who do you think you might pick?
such a great first and second serve and forehand, how do you think...
how would you do?
he's known for his professionalism, his focus. what was his prime message? what was the takeaway you had from the conversations with pete?
what about andre? you have a great return just like andre. how did you see him when you were growing up?
when you describe andre, a lot of people say those things about you, as well. do you feel like you relate to his game and personality?
you have a big birthday coming up this spring. have you given any thought to what you'd like for your 25th?
one you're happy to get through?
were you surprised or not surprised that serving for the match he came in on two first and two second serves, not surprised at all?
so how did you put it down? what worked for you in the end?
for whatever reason, when something like that happens, do you know why it's happening?
you don't often face guys who serve and volley which makes the return game entirely different. it seemed like when you were getting his first back, you were doing fairly well there. do you change your mentality at all? i guess certain things probably don't matter as much when you are facing a baseliner.
in most sports, team sports, you have your team members around you to huddle up or talk in the dugout. tennis is such an individual and mental sport. could you talk about the whole process of selftalk over hours in a match? what's that like?
do you ever want to tell yourself, be quiet and shut it down?
that 54 game when he served for it and you broke him at love, so you're going in there and you just say, well, that's all right; now i'm just going to hit it?
given, you know, the struggles with the injuries and getting rhythm this year in general, i know he isn't the best player in the world, but just to kind of get through there, good player, kind of sneak it out and come from the break down in the second; pretty good stuff?
berdych. can you talk about next round a little bit?
do you want to assess your performance, how you felt you played? take us through the match a bit.
were you pleased with your play post the great upset of federer, or did you feel a little of an emotional letdown after that weekend?
verge of the top 10 now. this tournament, miami, are hard court tournaments. you have had a couple decent wins but never big results. big weeks for you?
have you discussed with anyone or talked about or thought about what you might do as far as doubles and the olympics goes?
serena has mentioned you as a partner. obviously having her serve on your side would be something she'd want. have you talked to her about it at all?
incredible win in switzerland. congratulations. could you talk about the role that captain courier played, sort of getting into the swing of things now, not just a rookie anymore as a leader? how did he get to you? how did he motivate you? what did he tell you to do?
specifically what kind of point?
have you noticed who you might be playing in the next round? you might have a rematch with mahut.
what are your thoughts maybe having a rematch out here?
if i could just go back to the davis cup, jim spoke about your win against roger, just incredibly strong. take us through that. how did you orchestrate that so you didn't take your foot off the pedal?
didn't you end that match with two outright return of serve winners?
does that show you that it's possible? you know, week to week on the tour that you can return to the point where you don't necessarily have to hold your serve every single game to win matches?
break down the tie against france, if you would wrap up on davis cup?
what is your best memory in roland garros?
yeah.
do you expect to see tsonga in singles in davis cup?
do you still follow college tennis?
(indiscernible.)
talk about wil spencer for a minute, please.
you went through four years of being no.3 and you changed a lot of things, the diet and the conditioning. was there some point along there in your training that you said, i can beat these guys? these guys are not so good that i can't beat them? was there a moment or a flash or a match or training session where you said, i can do it?
was there any temptation to kinda just throw up your hands and say, boy, being no.3 is great; i can make great money; i can win a couple of grand slams?
there's 2.2 seconds now between your first and second hit. only 2.2. as fast as you are, that puts you under pressure quite a bit. do you think the racquets, we have to stop making them faster, or do you think that the game can even use more speed?
but do you think if they make it faster you're going to be able to stand up to that?
you talked about what was driving you when you were no.3, but what, if anything, changed in your perspective towards the sport now that you are no.1 and now that you've reached a lot of your goals?
when you look at the two goals for this season  let's say olympic gold and roland garros, two of the things that you haven't achieved yet  how do you look at those? how do you compare them?
i saw some pictures that show you had a great time playing soccer here, and also in dubai you said you ski a lot in serbia. roger will say, i will wait until i retire. i don't want to have to get accident. you just want to enjoy your time?
you spoke about belief and doubts. when did the doubts stop? was it after the first australian open possibly or was it after last year's australian open?
do you consider it an advantage to be serving first?
yes.
today a lot of little boys who play tennis, they are expecting to get encouragement from you yesterday when you practiced on the court. i also see some little players who also play tennis, they want to ask for autograph. unfortunately, they were turned down by the security guard. they want to get some encouraging words from you.
(question about dietary needs.)
when you sign the chinese signature, did you realize you give one more stroke in that chinese letter de? a lot of fans are talking about your chinese signature. for the second day you made correct chinese word, but today you forgot to add one more stroke to chinese word. how do you think the chinese words is it difficult to learn? and another question, if you win the title in shanghai masters, are you going to sign the chinese de again?
after you win the title today, you have traveled to china open for three times. you never lose. my question is: how long do you think this momentum will maintain, that is to say, you will never lose in china open? will you come back to china open next year?
my question is: did you have rehearsal to dance the gangnam? if you win the shanghai masters, will you dance the gangnam again? if you win china open you said you will come back to china open next year. what kind of performance are you going to have next year?
can you just tell me how you feltthe match progressed. tsonga said he missed an opportunity in the first set. he broke you and then you were able to come back.
you were talking about the fans, and your fans had a chance to see you dancing, speaking, and even writing some chinese. i work for a tv channel in brazil. since you are going to brazil next month, i'm wondering what kind of performance can the fans expect from you?
following on from the dance, you looked perhaps maybe slightly reluctant and nervous at the start, but you got into the swing of things. did you enjoy it?
the dance.
the call that jo was arguing during the tiebreak, have you been in that position where you might have felt distracted by an umpire's call? can you empathize with him?
regarding the rest of the season, is your target now to regain the no.1 spot in the world?
first, congratulations for you to enter finals in china open for three times consecutively. i noticed that you used your hand to touch your back. it seems like something goes wrong with your back when you change the side.
you seemed pretty much in control obviously really easily in the first set, and then he put up a little bit of a fight in the second set, but you just seemed to like be winding him up like a yoyo and stuff like that. just talk about how you felt during the match.
tell me about florian mayer, how he played tonight. looked like he had a pretty good game. you just overpowered him.
talk about jo.
can you talk a little bit about just this year? i know there are a few more weeks. but obviously, to most people's standards, a great year for you, but compared to your standard of last year, not the same. talk about that a little bit.
can you talk about your two little brothers, please? i understand they are trying to play professional tennis on tour level, but still a lot of years. the youngest one is playing challengers right now. can you talk a little about them, please.
first, congratulations. we know that the way for you to celebrate success is very much unique. you use chinese to write a word which is called de. why did you work out a way to celebrate like that? how long does it for you to work out like this? how many hours did you take to practice? did you notice i had one more stroke in that de chinese letter?
so tonight you won pretty convincingly. do you think that there were any weak parts of your game, anything you would have liked you'd do better for maybe next match?
what are you planning for florian mayer?
you're through to the semifinals. do you feel that you have not faced much of a test at all along the way so far?
talking about your serve, four aces in one single game, have you ever done that before?
we have the press tennis tournament coming up, and i'm still looking for a doubles partner. are you interested?
it's sunday.
whichever side you would prefer, i'll do the other one.
what kind of a preparation did you have for this match? did you ever think that the opponent has a strong or threatening service to you or probably ze zhang's backhand has already constituted a huge backhand?
in previous match of ze zhang, he said that he will definitely beat you because ze zhang's coach know what is your weak point. what kind of...
for the second set, when you take lead to 50 but then you win finally 53, i want to know that probably you fail to stay focused during the match.
a couple of days ago it seems that a video between you and sharapova start to be very much popular on the internet. but in the afternoon when we interviewed sharapova, sharapova said that actually she didn't know that even you're going to play a match tonight. did you keep a close watch on her match, as well?
it is rumored that in french open when you and your coach start champagne to celebrate because you win actually because nadal for eight games. i really want to understand what's going on there. can you tell me the real situation at that time?
it is said in the internet that in the final of french open, while it was raining, you, together with your coaches, start several bottles of champagne to celebrate because at that point you had already taken lead over nadal for eight games. so i want to understand whether this is real. if not, what's the real situation?
there has been talk recently that in the women's game they're going to try and stamp out the grunting. do you have an opinion at all on the amount of grunting that goes on in the women's game?
maria may be pretending that she doesn't care about you, but you must be aware of she's involved in the sugarpova business.
you tried it?
so how good it is?
do you like it?
also, i know that you tried a few chinese after the match when you were doing the oncourt interview, but we didn't hear clearly what you actually said. could you please share that again? what was that?
after the match. on the court interview.
do you actually know what that means?
congratulations to you for your win. i want to ask you, this is the first match you played after you lose to murray. how do you feel today? it's easy for you to win the first set and the third set, but for the second set, although it is tough, you lose the set. what might be the reasons?
my question is after you lose in tiebreak, what kind of motivation or driving force did you have to move forward? because i noticed small ball boy gave you a big smile, so that means that he give you a lot of forces or driving force to move forward.
can you give me your thoughts on the announcement by the australian open organizers today that there will be record prize money in january? does that mean that any reports of a threat of a boycott are now over?
i guess after the second set did you make any particular adjustments that you think helped you in the third?
you have not been in 2011 here in china, and what is your impression now for the china open? you have here many fans from china, and we see serbian flags all around. what is your impression about that?
compared to the courts here in beijing to the courts in australian open, also us open, can you tell which one is slower to play, which one is faster, and which one suits your game better?
it seemed like berrer came out and played a pretty aggressive style, going up to the net a lot. is that something you anticipated? how did you kind of tailor your game to that?
i was kind of like referring to him coming up to the net, and it seemed like in the third set in particular you were able to lob it over him considerably easier.
what went wrong today?
like you said, he served insanely well. can you go into that a little bit, like how because it looked like you made some adjustments in the second set. you were standing back off the baseline a little bit more. can you tell me a little bit more about that?
can you just express how disappointed you are? you made the final last year, so presumably you came into this tournament hoping to go one better.
you seem like a fan favorite here in beijing. can you talk about that a little bit?
so you will stay here several days or come to shanghai?
what made the difference?
you feel on this fast court once you get ahead the conditions maybe help frontrunners, don't they?
how difficult is it to defeat novak and roger in the same tournament? just one day between the two, too.
until that first break, you had been holding serve pretty comfortably. did you feel your own service level dropped a bit after that?
talk about the atmosphere out there tonight.
what's the schedule now? home?
straight to l.a.?
in terms of your own game, what would be the biggest pluses you take out of this week?
did ivan speak to you after yesterday's win?
what was the view?
when will you link up with ivan again?
when do you expect to make a decision on the davis cup?
in terms of the djokovic win, that was a big win. coming into this match, did you feel you were able to put that away and go on the court and think about this one?
roger talked last month about carrying on until the olympics. the way he's played the last three, four months, could you see him doing that and being competitive?
what made the difference tonight?
were you worried when he broke back?
how confident are you now after winning five of the last seven atp events?
through that stretch what's been the key for you?
there are not too many tournaments where you've been in the final seven times. what does that mean?
you can obviously play in different ways and you're a versatile player. do you feel over the years you've become a more assertive player and that's the difference?
aggressive.
we heard yesterday that you refused to play an exhibition against rafa in spain in july. what were the reasons for saying no?
this title could be better if you win against djokovic?
talk about the atmosphere out there tonight.
grand slams, the olympics, what would be your goals for this year?
wonderful result. what was the difference between the two of you?
your service was pretty extraordinary apart from that one game. can't serve much better than that, can you?
you said you got nervous. what kind of thoughts were going through your mind?
because that's always been such a strong point of your game. is it just the fact that suddenly you realized, bloody hell, that's the world no.1 over there?
at that stage, did rome last year come to your mind at all?
about the final, if it's del potro, you haven't played him since i think he made his comeback. you've got a very good record against him on hardcourts.
you said on court that you prefer roger though. did you say that on court?
it was a long time ago, but do you ever reflect on the firstround match you played against him, and what do you remember of it now?
given the streak that novak had last year and unbeaten this year and the way you outplayed him, does this count as one of your best wins, even though you said you could play better than that?
french.
just talking about your approach of overcoming the nerves, should we expect a mentally tougher murray this year?
you talked about the australian open. obviously it was a tough loss. maybe talk about the lessons you took away and how you applied them tonight.
you're the sort of bloke that does watch a lot of tennis, even when you're not involved in it. a year ago with where you were sort of the state of mind, did you watch the dubai final last year?
were you watching tennis the proceeding days, or was it a question of, oh, i don't want watch this?
i have to ask you about 5all down in the second set tiebreaker. incredible comeback.
you've been serving very well all week. do you feel it's something that's been exceptionally working for you this week?
one step away from a historic fifth title here. you have having four is history in itself. how does that feel?
you've played andy so many times, haven't you?
you haven't played him since lendl joined the team. have you noticed any changes since lendl was brought in?
you've seen quite a lot of juan martin in the last few weeks. considering the ill fortune that he had a couple years ago, is he back there? for a long time we've been thinking about the four. should we be thinking about the five soon?
jo.
it was a lot tighter today than your match in rotterdam. he says he feels he's improved since then. what was better for him today?
i apologize if you answered this earlier in the week; i haven't heard you answer it. but in the past, you've said when you play tournament in basel or here you prefer to stay in a hotel than home. is that the case this year as well?
with novak losing today, he made quite a lot of unforced errors against andy.
he's lost early in the year as well. does that give you and others chasing him, does that provide sort of a chink in his seemingly invincible armor going forward in terms of maybe grand slams and the rankings?
what do you remember about that match where you met in the first round five years ago now?
yeah.
so far as the crowd is concerned, you're the local player. you could hear that in the tiebreaker, i think.
do you think that's going to help in tight moments tomorrow?
we've seen you come back from those kind of positions so often. we thought you were going to do it again. did you think you were going to do it again?
you came at the net many times today. more than usual. what was your thought...
you said you made a lot of unforced errors today. why was that, do you think?
how difficult is it to maintain such a tremendous standard that you've delivered over the last 12 months.
you took a bit of time off after melbourne. do you feel like you're still feeling your way back in?
when we had the preview presser you talked about the awards ceremonies and doing a lot of offthecourt stuff. when i talked to martin kaymer, he said he struggled with all the distractions. is that something you're still coping with?
62, 52 in an hour. at that point, how did you feel? because that's when you started coming back.
i understand you don't view this as a defense of your title, but you were going for four in a row having got the hat trick last year. how do you feel about relinquishing your grasp on the silverware here?
in the long run, do you think this might not be a bad thing losing today? it will stop all of us asking you how long you can stay unbeaten.
andy seems to be improving. you've played him twice within a few weeks. tell us how he's changing his game.
do you think this could be a defining victory for him in terms of as he tries to overcome and you roger and the others?
your reaction to tonight and your performance? how do you feel you played?
how difficult is it to be always in the shadow, especially at home since you come from the same team, same country?
you just mentioned you took a chance with the second serve. you were serving really well in the set. what chance were you really trying to take here?
what were you trying to do with the second serve?
both times? there was two double faults in the tiebreak?
the way you played in the second set, you can take that confidence to indian wells and miami?
how difficult is it to face nole, novak, seeing as he's your friend? was that part of reason why you began slowly in the first set?
something more personal about the tattoo?
when you said you were nervous on the set point, what was that? sweaty hands? you couldn't think right?
he's no.1 who you know the best. there are few players who would know him more than you do. do you think there is some secret that he only unleashes on the court?
of game play.
do you feel like you dominated pretty well today?
having beaten him 11 times, it is difficult...
12 now; before the match it was 11.
is it difficult to go out there for a 12th time andfocus...
have you ever kept a little black book or record about opponents? you know, little things you picked up, weak points, or is it all just in your head?
i was going to say, severin or paul will come in and bring up salient points.
when you meet somebody you haven't played for a while or the first time you play them, do you ever look at videos of them.
to those player who lost to you have to you so many time in a row, do you feel maybe a little bit sorry for them for losing again, again, again?
for the first time in this tournament you will play against a player with a twohanded backhand.
do you have to make any adjustments?
it's wellknown that you're not hawkeyes greatest fan. i don't know whether you're aware, but in the earlier match between murray and berdych, there was quite a contentious point where the serve by the line judge was called long, and then hawkeye overruled it and the umpire didn't say replay the point and he gave the point to murray. it did take away break point from berdych when murray was serving for the match.
do you think there an a woolliness about the whole hawkeye rules at the moment?
there was a question of whether the point should have been replayed.
do you think spectators preferred it when the players had arguments with umpires and there was no hawkeye?
this week you have more than ten million fans followers on your facebook.
(indiscernible.)
obviously how difficult is it playing your close rival, close friend?
how old were you when you first met him?
so when did the tables turn? when did you realize you were better than him?
andy murray tomorrow. do you regard every opportunity you get to play against one of the top four particularly as a real challenge to just emphasize your position as no.1?
have you watched any of his matches this week?
the quick conditions here, who do you think it favors? you? him?
couple times tonight janko got close to winning the second set and you got out of trouble with big serves. would you say the serve is the biggest difference in your game between now and, say, two years ago?
dubai tennis championships was again voted as the best atp 500 by the players. were you one of the players who voted for it? if yes, why?
in brevity, what was your take on that call on match point? it clearly annoyed you.
what was mohamed's explanation to you? how did he justify it?
are you saying it did affect your return?
why didn't you call for the supervisors?
they wouldn't let you have it?
obviously after he served again it must have affected the rest of the way. must have been thinking about it the rest of the match.
will it bother you as you go back home after the tournament?
what did you think of the match overall? what was your verdict?
moving better than yesterday?
feeling better?
how do you look at your next opponent, berdych if he wins? i think he's won the first set. that really emphasizes this tournament, doesn't it, pretty early on getting someone of that quality?
what is it about his game that gives you trouble, berdych?
will he be happier on a faster surface?
do you think he's come up against you previously at times when you've been off your game, or he's been just...
four.
you're not defending many points in the upcoming stretch. are you looking forward to that? are you more excited? do you feel you can really do some damage in the states?
when you practice in miami, do you actually get on crandon park, key biscayne?
one of the tv guys told me you said you had blistered hands.
on other matters, did you see the dereck chisora and david haye press conference?
you happy with that?
you say you focused on what you did. but now the match is over, do you think he's the kind of player that once he gets ahead, with that dangerous attacking game he could have played even better?
do you have a preference for night play or day play? you've played twice now in the 7:00 spot. is that what you would prefer?
everyone is saying that has played during the day in the sun is very, very fast conditions.
the tournament doesn't have the firstround bye and also has a saturday final. how big is that difference in terms of the rhythm, preparation, concentration?
what advantage do left handers have in matches?
talk to us about youzhny. he does really well here. how do you approach that?
when you have played on the quicker hardcourts, do you intentionally make some adjustment like move in more than the slower hard court?
how much adjustment do you have to make from llodra and lopez to youzhny in the next round? he's more of a baseline player.
there have been times you went against youzhny, so what do you think of the next one? it will be 12th time you are meeting.
he was tough to get on top of, wasn't he?
over the last year, you've had such a wonderful time. you win most times at the crucial points, even in this set just now. when it comes to the tiebreak, you always win the crucial points. what is it you can do that other people can't?
how do you look at your next match? are there any things that you would like to improve from what you've done in the last matches?
when the two of you took a vacation after london last year, was there a, any tennis played, and b, any tennis talked about?
was there any competitive things? swim race you out to that buoy out there?
what parts of his game will you really watch out for?
what parts of janko's game?
he's only recently started winning titles. what's the difference now?
at the start of last year you were already no.3 in the world; you had a slam win and soon another; a big success. nobody would say, wow that guy is a failure. yet, you still had this thing where you wanted to push it more and made some hard changes to do that. i'm wondering where you think that kind of rare drive comes from? is it something you have? something you learned?
talk to us about the match. you did very well.
these conditions  fast courts, hot weather  is that good for you?
now you play murray next. you're 31 against him and he hasn't beaten you since 2005.
you obviously remember that match in bercy. it was close, very close, wasn't it?
you haven't played yet on center court this week, right?
tomorrow you will be playing. does it make a difference for you that it's a bit slower? would you prefer that?
much is made of the top 4, the big 4 in tennis at the moment. now, you're right behind them, snapping at their heels. do you sometimes get the feeling that the likes of you and ferrer and jowilly are overlooked a little bit?
you've beaten i think almost all of them.
what does it take for you to win a grand slam? you can beat all the top players.
do you think you're a better player now than when you reached the wimbledon final?
this season you already have a title; you've done great in australia. do you feel that the start of the season is a bit stronger than before?
would you like have to more fast surfaces on the tour like this her in dubai?
also, you beat murray at roland garros in 2010. slow, slow that day.
you won in straight sets. what do you remember about that match beyond what you just said?
and now andy is being coached by your hero.
he's given you little bits of advice over the years, hasn't he?
coaching?
besides feeling ill as you said, did you have any physical problems other than that?
were you feeling a little unwell before the match started?
is it a food poisoning type thing?
did the heat have anything to do with it?
is it flulike condition, or what was...
what were the conditions like out there?
did you see the chiudinelli match? given your condition today, how do you approach that?
34 down in the final set you did what was required. is that a consolation for you?
how much have you seen of chiudinelli? i don't think you've ever played him.
how does to work when ivan is off site? will he watch it, and will you talk to him in the states or will you just get on with it?
was it your mistakes or were there things that berrer was doing real well?
he said he was too nice after that match.
do you think you've got that ruthless streak?
you said you had signed up or tried to get in doubles with him. was there no thought of playing with jamie here?
you seemed to have helped ivan's as form as well.
restarting can sometimes be a bit difficult after a three, fourweek break. were you pleased that it went quite well?
you were winning a lot of points at the start, and then finding yourself set point down, did that create extra pressure?
would you like there to be more tournaments on the tour with surfaces as quick as this?
do you players try to make your voice heard?
how do you find dubai as a place to play, and where would it rank in terms of your top destinations?
is it in your top ten?
you play lopez next.
how do you look ahead to that match?
15.
no.
could you confirm something about your position on the tour in south america, opponents, countries?
your first set was a very dominating affair. do you think this was your best first set this year considering llodra a not a pushover?
lopez a enjoying a careerhigh ranking now and he's 30; mardy fish as a well. do you find it a bit surprising that these players are doing so well later on in their careers? a something happening on tour?
do you think you played the perfect game on serve and return today?
nobody would like to take anything away from your eight wins in montecarlo, which is a great achievement. but today didn't you feel that djokovic wasn't the real best djokovic?
it seems to me that you put more speed on your first serve. do you agree with that?
what is the secret, you have won many tournaments, but you win one tournament eight times? what is the secret about montecarlo? you have wind, soft ground. is this the reason you play every year on such a high level?
in what time during the final did you feel you were going to be the winner?
you have a lot of reasons to be happy today. what is the biggest reason for you to be happy? the fact you beat novak or that you won this tournament again?
you've had to withstand quite a few upsets in finals recently. how satisfying is it to beat the world no.1 and win one of these trophies again psychologically going into the rest of the year?
you came into the tournament a bit worried about your knee. do you feel totally happy with the knee now?
do you plan to train more light for the upcoming weeks?
six wins in roland garros, eight wins in montecarlo, what stands out more first? today when you broke djokovic five times, he never reached deuce. how do you explain this?
on his serve.
yesterday you said it was a little bit too early to face djokovic. actually it was not too early to face him.
have you made a decision if you want to play for the davis cup?
you will make the decision later?
it's been a tricky week for you in every respect. was there a sense perhaps today, as we felt, that everything caught up with you a little bit, and perhaps that reflected a little bit in your performance today?
did you feel that he played at a higher level than when you beat him on clay last year?
after you lost the first set 63, normally you are a fighter, second set you were down 40, didn't seem that there was a way to change the game.
would you say this final shouldn't count as a trend for the rest of the season, that it's an exception?
everyone could see that you were not the real djokovic today. what was going through your mind when you were playing and you realized also that you were in trouble? you lost five times your serve without ever reaching deuce. what is your feeling?
given the circumstances, you've done very well to be here. do you think somewhere down the line maybe you'll look back on this and feel a great sense of pride about what you've done this week?
there have been many outstanding achievements in this sport. winning a title eight times in a row, what do you make of that as an individual achievement?
do you think due to the tragic loss you will make some change in the next couple of weeks in your tournament schedule to get a little bit more rest?
do you think finally the last word about this tournament is the unique situation here technically, not because of the ball, the surface, the wind, your personal problems, or is it a unique situation which doesn't count too much?
so no achievement today, but a real match.
you played a great match. however the score is 34. is it still a good feeling?
and what about his game?
he lost seven times against djokovic. do you believe he has to change his game against him in order to win?
can you explain why you're saying that djokovic is the one with the pressure.
you said on tv that what you needed was to play these kind of matches.
about tomorrow's final, berdych said rafa would win. who would you pick?
they haven't played against the match in melbourne. do you think they're still both thinking bit?
it couldn't have been easy out there, for a lot of reasons.
was the key moment the beginning of the second set, because you were pretty nervous after the first set, and you were able to get a break immediately?
he said he had five breakpoints and you had one. he said it could have been 21 for him.
your mental strength, besides your high quality of game, when it comes to difficult moments, pulls you through.
when you are down one set, does it help the fact that you are up 81 versus him, so you're more confident thinking you've beaten him so many times?
how do you look at the challenge of trying to end rafa's 41 match streak here?
who is the favorite, the guy that won the last seven finals or the guy that won the last seven tournaments here?
you beat rafa twice last year on clay. do you think it gives you some advantage for the final?
because of rome and madrid last year, tactically do you expect something new from him?
you said before nadal has been the best player clay court player ever. what about bjorn borg?
how difficult were the conditions today?
you look like a different player compared to two years ago, one year ago, in the way you play. you have or chances, more things to do, you don't play the same in the court. what happened? what is the reason?
and you go more on the ranking?
did you feel that novak got himself more focused in the second and third sets? what was the difference in his level of play?
could you be more precise in the way you are disadvantaged because of the conditions.
why was it a disadvantage for you and not for novak?
you say it disadvantaged your game. in what ways?
when you finish a tournament like this, beating murray, playing better from the back of the court, which feeling do you have inside yourself?
when you compare the last two matches you played, do you think there's a difference in murray being further back in positioning? is that a big difference between him and novak?
if nadal qualifies, who is your pick for tomorrow?
no?
why?
after the match you said it was a strange match. can you explain what you meant?
you asked for the doctor twice. can you explain to us what happened.
you say the conditions were changing all the time, but you were able to adapt better than he did.
it seems after this week that you are now back to business. i'm sure this must give you confidence.
the fact that you feel nobody can outrun you is a change, isn't it?
would it be an accomplishment to beat nadal, if the word is correct?
jo was saying that he didn't know whether you should go for it or just wait. what do you think?
does it mean something beating the no.1 french player?
you're in the semis without losing a set. everything is under control or...
bjorn borg said you were the greatest clay court player ever.
tsonga, simon?
yes.
simon plays in the same way like you, with long rallies. do you prefer that?
long rallies.
14 victories. it's a big number. do you think could be the end one day?
as we asked to djokovic, about the blue clay in madrid, what do you think about this? do you agree or not?
did you have the opportunity to practice last year on this blue clay?
rafa, what do you think of the court here?
i didn't mean people falling over. there were a couple of strange bounces also.
great effort to take the first set, given all the breakpoints. where do you think it got away from you?
was that concentration?
when someone is playing at that level, is it exasperating to try to create chances against him? did it get to you that you couldn't get into any rhythm on his serve?
was it frustrating for you out there mentally?
is there anything you could have done differently or you would have liked to have done better?
madrid is going to be played on blue clay in two weeks. do you like this change or would you prefer to remain on red clay?
talking about the surface here, was there a little bit of a sense that you were worried about your footwork at the back of the court today?
so trying to impose your game, you wanted to try to play forward. is that tough when a guy is striking the ball as solidly and effectively as he was today?
the thing you were talking about yesterday about the court being adjusted after the davis cup and taking time to settle down...
was it easier to play today than yesterday?
did you consider pulling out?
can sometimes actually playing be a bit of a therapy almost?
were you thinking to possibly to go to the funeral and then come back or it's out of the possibility?
how much stronger do you feel after that?
grand slams aside, to win a tournament like this in these circumstances, would it rank extremely highly, given the highly charged emotion of the whole week?
when are you planning to go back to belgrade for the first time, do you think?
coming back to business. berdych is next. what do you think?
in a couple weeks you will be in madrid playing on blue clay. do you like this change or would you have preferred to stay on red clay?
did the tournament ask for your advice?
were you in favor when tiriac brought up the beautiful girls?
could you tell me how you manage stress on the court. do you have any rituals for the difficult moments when the tension goes up, strategies to face these moments?
occasionally.
how do you feel winning this match?
it's a good start for you on clay.
there is a slogan that says now about the fabulous four. don't you think it should be about the fabulous five?
once you were considered just a player who could play very well on hard court, maybe on grass. clay was probably not your favorite surface, even if you were born on clay. is it changing?
if you have to pick your favorite surface to play the best match of your life, where would you go?
tomorrow you will play against djokovic. how do you think you will manage the rivalry with him? will you have some rituals, some particular way to approach this match?
he was winning. he had a match point.
i don't want to embarrass you with a private question, but how different is it to have a girlfriend who was a tennis player compared to a girlfriend who is not a tennis player in terms of practicing or organizing your life? do you see a difference or not?
it was a tactical and physical match. did you like that match?
it was 6love and 61, but in between there was that second set. what happened?
did it help knowing you could stay on the court longer than he could?
physically you seemed to play relaxed and freely. can we say your back problems are over?
you seemed to have struck the right balance between aggressiveness and playing defensively during that match.
the next match will be against tsonga. you beat him in rome the last time you played.
there were two serious injuries here. is there a problem with the courts?
there will be two french players in the quarterfinals here. this is rare, isn't it? is it because you were here for the davis cup; it felt like home?
this means there will be at least one french player in the semifinal.
would you rate jo on clay at the same level as soderling, berdych, those types of players?
did you practice a lot together during the davis cup?
jo and you have had a record in this region. in 2004 you won the doubles in grasse.
the match was more easy than you expected or...
two players twisted badly their ankles during the tournament. do you think that the clay is a little bit more dangerous this year?
bad luck?
could you talk about what toni brings, what his presence brings when he's at the tournament, and then when he's not?
a sad day for novak today. i don't know if you heard about his grandfather. do you think he was brave to play today?
how did you feel about your performance today?
the sensations were pretty good with everything?
when you have an injury, how long is it usually for you before you can push it 100%, especially with your knee?
did you feel you had to be more careful, more cautious?
dolgopolov/djokovic is the sort of match you would like to watch?
was it particularly breezy out on the court today?
yes.
have you seen the match of david?
what did you think of real madrid last night?
how did you feel today?
it was your fourth game with him. the first three you won easily. how do you explain today?
how did you feel on clay today?
what is your verdict on your year so far? it hasn't been an easy year, has it?
you feel good, healthy now?
how do you approach the match against djokovic? are you confident?
after you had your little dip at the end of the second set today, what was the difference to turn it around in the third?
do you think your style suits clay?
was clay the first surface you played on back home?
what are your memories of that davis cup match you played against britain in ukraine?
you were how old then?
was that kind of a breakthrough moment for you, being picked in that tie and playing someone like murray?
probably as good a workout as you could have expected. first set was probably closer than 6love.
how easy do you find the switch to clay?
what do you expect from dolgopolov? he tends to mix it up quite well.
is he, do you think, the most unorthodox player on the circuit right now?
what especially? is there something that he does that is so unusual? is it the slice?
if you dictate against someone like that, do you take away his threat?
do you think clay is his best surface?
we all talk about and like to write about the possibility you'll win the french open, be the first man in 50 years to hold all four grand slam titles. do you ever think about that?
i believe you watched the davis cup here. can you talk a bit about john isner's rise as a clay court player. have you been surprised how well he's done in davis cup?
so you had two breaks against you in each set. what is your reaction?
so it was a good match?
you know journalists like to compare the levels of players. so how do you rate yourself on clay?
but today you really seemed to have reached a high level.
you've been working on your attitude on the court. was that a typical example today?
tomorrow you will need to play your best tennis.
every time you played him, you took a set.
so you know how to play him.
how is it perceived among the players that he is now working with lendl?
murray is playing one of his first matches on clay this season, whereas you had the davis cup preparation. it's better to play murray now than to play him in the french open, don't you think?
and physically it's going to be tough, too.
how did you change the momentum in the second set?
it's your first win in montecarlo, right?
how many times did you win in the european clay?
so it's your first win on the european clay?
during the winter, you decided to play in south america. was it a good idea to play there? why did you choose to do that? most of the good players, they don't play in south america. they prefer to stay on hard court.
you were a finalist in houston last year, correct?
so you can play on clay. what are your expectations?
how pleased were you with that start to the clay court season?
do you think coming down here as soon as you did has been a benefit, as well?
was that at roehampton you tried practicing?
what sort of clay were you playing on in the states?
was that boca west?
can you buy up that clay court and stop them from turning it into a carpark?
is that cliff's?
was it that the weather that made the roehampton attempt less successful?
all in all a very satisfactory day. to beat a good player like that, dropping three games, a very good start to any part of the season, isn't it?
particularly happy with your serve? no breakpoints.
you said in miami you felt a couple years ago you lacked quite a few things on clay. do you feel that you're getting quite complete now on this surface?
does that mean that ivan is particularly valuable on this surface because he was so good on it?
just a little bit about your potential nextround opponents.
talk us through your clay court ambitions this year. how do you feel about the surface? what do you think about your prospects in the next few weeks?
how much did you play as a child, as a junior?
what is the biggest challenge for you playing on clay?
it's more mental than technical, the challenge for you?
do you enjoy it, the challenge, the mental side of that?
how far from here is your place now? can you walk?
not that far then (smiling).
so you have somewhere you can pop into.
have you sold your other car?
do you have a car here?
what is it like living around here? there are a lot of famous people, but a lot of tennis players. do you bump into each other occasionally?
you talked a bit earlier about 'top five'. have you got a particular target for this year in terms of ranking?
a lot of that will be staying fit?
what happened after your secondset comeback?
what about your knee?
what do you have to change for next week?
in the first set you had a point for a double break against you. how can you explain that?
it was a better match than when you played him as a junior?
what did you do after davis cup here?
was davis cup a good preparation for this tournament in spite of the disappointment?
inevitably it's a very emotional day for you. difficult to encapsulate 15 years in one press conference. how do you feel at the end of quite an astonishing career?
did you tell yourself not to cry?
you said it's time to try something else. what will you do?
there are worse places to finish than center court at montecarlo. not a bad venue, even for a goodbye.
how different is tennis now to when you started?
i'm sure there are many highlights in your career. would the davis cup win be ranked at the top?
the best win you've had?
you talk about the players and the representation you had for them. of course, currently there's a situation where no one knows what is going to happen with prize money; a little bit of rancor in the sport. if you could give a bit of advice to the players currently, what might that be to overcome the hurdles in the sport?
what are you going to miss most about this and what are you going to miss least about this?
what is the biggest lesson you can say to your children you received from tennis?
there are two sorts of coaches in tennis: maybe the coach you have for all your life, then the coach you change to find something new. what about piatti?
you mentioned the response of the players. what sort of things have they said to you over the last few months as you've been winding down?
will you walk back home?
do you think you reached your potential?
what does it represent to you to play against ljubicic?
did you think about it before playing, on the court?
you were tough with him in the first set.
does he represent something special for you and for croatian tennis?
you played a good match. how do you see you playing here in montecarlo? what are your goals here?
gal took a lot of risks today. is it the main reason of your loss, you think?
it's one match, but as we saw new abu dhabi, you're gearing up obviously for australia, as everyone is. what does this loss do for your preparations for australia?
can you talk a little bit about the reason why your new racquet is a little bit heavier? and when did you think about that and when did you decide to try this?
just out of curiosity, if there was one player in the history of tennis that you could play against, who would that be?
when you talk about the right way to play against gal, is it what you did at the beginning of the second set when you played more...
was it a similar match in 2009 against him?
he stopped playing?
you mentioned when he seemed to stop, and then you hit it into the net. as you said, you lost the concentration, but did you feel that continued onward or you were thinking about that moment even after that shot, the last few shots?
he's 16 now. he was up to 7 last year. from what you saw tonight, does he have the potential to go back into the top 10?
nice finish. maybe talk about the match, and especially when you're playing an opponent like youzhny who has beaten you before and has been up to no.8 in the world in the past.
such as?
there is this interesting rivalry between you and roger federer, which has been making lines every so often. we hope to see the two of you back together again. my question to you is: if there was one strength of roger's that you could incorporate in your play, what would that be?
did he help you to play well? because he also played extraordinarily well, didn't he, in this match? did that help raise your level?
it looked like the best of, i don't know, two, three, or four months you played. why did it suddenly come, such a good performance like that, right now?
there is a chance that you might play monfils in the semifinals. what do you remember from the match two years ago here?
three.
you hit many winners today, and you mentioned with the heavier racquet that you were concerned a little bit about the control. did you feel you were in control today with the racquet?
over the last week or so you've talked about physically getting ready in practice and stuff, but you mentioned mentally. i mean, are you feeling differently than you did maybe coming off of last season? were you a little bit fatigued?
no, i'm saying...
no, what i meant was at the end of 2011...
mentally do you feel that you're more fresh now than you were then?
did you meet with raul now in the locker room?
what do you talk about? more about tennis or more about football?
maybe you could talk a little bit about the match, especially the contrast between the first and second set.
the contrast between the first and second set. you got out so quickly in the first set, and the second set was a bit of a struggle.
what would you say was the difference in the end?
can you answer, please, what happened with the lights today?
she's saying you hit a lot of shots into the net.
so you are one of the greatest players who has ever set foot on court. can you tell us which has been the most important match of your career so far?
after strolling through the first two rounds, today was obviously a bit tougher. you lost three service games. what do you put that down to?
i just want to ask an overall question about the tournament. you have been coming here for many years now. how big has that tournament become in the time you've been coming here?
looking ahead to the semifinal, you obviously are up against tsonga. you played him quite a lot last year. i think you won the last four meetings between you two. what can we expect from tomorrow's game?
what did you like about what you did today?
(off microphone.)
we just heard yesterday that tsonga says he wants to come to the net more often. nadal says he'd like to improve his return a lot better and get his serve back on track. for you, looking ahead this year, what's the weapon you want to work on in the arsenal, or what do you want to do better than you were doing last year?
that seemed a lot more satisfactory today than yesterday. is that correct?
what was good about today? your movement and preparation for your shots with your footwork? was that one of the things?
this is always an important tournament, but because you had such a short preparation, does it make this tournament even more important for you to get the practice?
it's pretty cold and windy outside. so did it have an impact on the way you are playing today, especially the way you were returning the balls?
obviously he was a much lowerranked opponent, but he seemed to give you a good game, especially you had a lot of breakpoint opportunities that he was able to come to defend. it seemed like the scoreline made it look a lot easier than it was out there. it seemed like he put up a good challenge at that point, so what can you say?
your last season was pretty good, but you never really found the quality of serve you had at the end of 2010, especially at the us open. do you agree with that? do you have an explanation?
in terms of in between the end of the season, in a couple of interviews you talked about feeling your game was too predictable in 2010 sometimes.
2011, sorry.
of course. sorry about that. 2011. i mean, have you made some changes to kind of mix it up and are you starting to try some things on the court that are working well so far?
you came on court with a suitcase on wheels. was it for protecting the shoulder? what was it? is it new?
yeah, please.
at the hotel?
the conditions out there weren't easy. how did you deal with the conditions today? very different from yesterday?
it was a very quick game.
maybe you could just talk a little bit about the match. it looked like you were coasting in the first set, and then it got real tough as it went along and then you came back.
how is your shoulder doing?
are you starting to get a bit of rhythm with the new racquet? are you starting to get the feel of it?
have you changed racquets before in your career?
are what was the change in the racquet then? lighter or heavier?
how long did it take you to adjust to the change? a month? several weeks?
two years ago when you changed the string of your racquet, yellow one to the black one, would you say is the same process?
it's more difficult?
back in the second set, was it kohlschreiber coming out obviously he went to the net a lot more, but what happened early on that made it difficult for you? was it him being more aggressive, or was it something with your play that made it difficult?
after winning two or three doubles finals here with marc lopez, we were surprised not to see you playing doubles this year. why? is it because it makes you tired on the way to the australian open?
you played so well tonight. it was your first match against tsonga, world no.6. how is that experience?
last year was also very good for you. you jumped from 300something.
this year, what are your targets? which ranking you'd like to finish at the year end?
first off, how did it feel to play a whole match without a rain delay?
you were only broken once this entire tournament. in your opinion, what is it in your game that makes it so hard for guys to break you?
it would have been very easy to get discouraged or frustrated this week. do you take a special pride in keep your focus and sitting here as the champion?
was it especially given the conditions, given the travel...
you just talking about the emotions and disappointments of wimbledon and the olympic games, on a scale of one to ten  with ten being the best  coming in here where would you have rated yourself, and coming out of tournament where would you rate yourself?
also after winning last year was it important for to you protect the points by coming here, too?
over the summer you haven't received as much talk as maybe roger and andy and even rafa to some extent. now maybe with this title you'll get a little more focus going into new york. do you prefer to sort of fly under the radar, or do you like having a little more pressure on you?
can you talk to us about the match tonight? were you so strong? was he that weak? what happened so that it was such a quick finale?
can i ask you an annoying question? was the fact that you were the only top four player here less pressure on you?
your comments last night about the roof, will you consider coming back to this event if they keep it in this facility without a roof?
in the quarterfinals today and in the finals you were facing two of the best onehanded backhands, which you didn't have for some years. which one was more tough to handle?
something just totally away from here, from this, i know you can't do anything about this, but i would just like your opinion. do you think bob and mike bryan should be given membership to the all england?
no, because they have and they've never been given a membership. singles winners get memberships obviously, but the only doubles team as of late that has received a membership are the woodies. mike and bob have never been invited.
the match seemed a lot closer than the score indicates. just wondering what you feel you did better tonight?
last night you said that you were physically tired. another rain delay today; two matches yesterday. are you starting to feel a mental fatigue at all at this point?
has the court been noticeably different with the conditions and after the rain delays?
what would be the first one or two things that you do when you get back to the locker room to get your energy back?
when you get back to the locker room, what is the first thing you do to get some energy back after the match is over?
you said that probably floor was a little bit wet. what i saw after rain your eyes more sharp, and even when you are asking for the balls to be checked. do you think that visibility changes after rain also because light is artificial or something as that?
during the match, are you having to keep reminding yourself to stay calm, stay focused, because of the frustrations and all that that's going on.
is that the bigger factor compared to the physical or the technical side of the game when you have these frustrations?
can you just look ahead to the final with richard? 61 record in your favor.
where is your team? where are marjan and miljan? where the other guys? will they come back in cincinnati our us open?
i know.
congratulations on the win, john. you said out there didn't feel like you were tired even though you only had about two hours rest. did you just feel warmed up then?
was there anything special about the match, anything sort of curious about you guys being the two biggest servers that you thought about eventually having a match against him?
you seemed a little edgy in the breaker, very angry at yourself a couple times.
did you get any advice from your old 88 year old grandfather before the match?
look ahead to playing gasquet in the semifinals.
look ahead to playing him.
yeah.
talk about how difficult it was to play two matches, five sets, starting as early as you did and playing right up until 20 minutes ago?
can i ask about your next round. you're be playing one of the two top servers in the game. have you had a chance to watch much of milos raonic, and do you have an impression of the type of game he plays and the challenges that he will present if you play him?
mardy had your number the last three times you faced each other. what was the difference this time?
you changed your tshirt after you lost the second set. is that a superstition? you change from white to black.
how much of a challenge was it to play him tonight playing the second match of the day?
getting a chance to play your fellow countryman tipsarevic, what's that like for you? he said you know each other really intimately as players and friends.
just to follow up, you said you looked up to him. obviously he's a little bit older than you. maybe the relationship's changed a little bit with all the success you've had. he said you set the mark for him. how do you think your relationship has changed since you initially met 15 years ago?
do you feel things are catching up with you at the moment after all the hype and emotion of london and traveling over here and the time changes?
it must be a while since you played off this stadium. there was a lot of atmosphere tonight and interaction with the fans  some good, some bad. what was it like?
what's the one thing tipsarevic does that gives you trouble that you know about?
the first question after you won the olympics gold medal in your press conference was how your kiss was with your girlfriend. you've been a good guy over the years and don't show few emotion. what were you thinking about that question right off the bat after winning the gold?
how did i feel about today's match? how did you come up physically after it?
after sunday, did you give any thought at all to saying, i need a few days off after this emotional win and give this tournament a pass?
what happened with the knee in the second set and how is it?
three days after the whole emotional drama and all that, are you still on cloud 9?
thoughts on playing milos raonic in the next round?
do you carry on your regular fitness training during tournament play?
it's not just limited to tennis, but you talk to athletes who have that kind of breakthrough victory like you did last weekend, and they say it changes them. they feel differently about what they can do and how they feel about themselves. i know it's been quick, but how differently do you feel after the gold medal win?
at the opening of the olympics games, despite protests from the british, american, canadian, and other governments, the ioc decided not to give a moment of silence for the murdered athletes from the 1972 games. i want to know if you had any comments or feelings, because you were part of the atmosphere and you lived in england and were aware of the situation, whether you felt the ioc made basically a very, very bad gesture on their part?
you had some reasons not to miss this tournament because of the rules and so forth, but were there any positive reasons to play? can you just sort of describe the decisionmaking process you went through?
has the great britain olympic committee talked to you about being involved on sunday for the closing ceremony, such as being the flag bearer?
given the magnitude of the victory on sunday, what provides the greater satisfaction: is it knowing that you got over what you might have considered a psychological hurdle, or that tactically what you did against roger worked obviously in a straightsets victory?
tell us how you do it.
just coming off washington and then now a tough first round here. you've had a great summer.
just talk a little bit about regrouping at the beginning of the third physically and mentally?
is there any difference in the way you play the game now, say, compared to ten year ago? would you have something that you do strategywise on a certain point?
when you won that masters tournament against hewitt a long time ago, that's when you got to no.2 roughly, i think.
what were you thinking the ideal future for you would be in terms things you would attain in tennis?
winning slams?
we had novak in here earlier talking about the challenge of transitioning from grass to hard court in such a short time frame. do you have any kind of advantage based on having a couple hard court matches under your belt now?
i just want to sidetrack you for a little bit. you talked about technology change. you're one of the few players who probably played on the old situation here in toronto. hawkeye, one the technologies that's used in tennis, is now here on the grandstand court. has that had an impact on players and specifically their personalities? guys like andy roddick have calmed down. it's really allowed fans and everything to become involved in the game more, too. do you think it's had that sort of impact?
would you enjoy a day where indian wells is the common across all tournaments where it's on all courts at all times everywhere?
i am a travel writer, not a sports writer.
any special technique that you use to deal with the fatigue or the jet lag that you have to encounter traveling all over the world?
that's it?
do you ever take anything special with you almost like an amulet or little something you never travel without?
i'm moving on from that. just anything special you'll never travel without?
anything special, like...
like a lucky charm.
in a general sense, right now where do you feel your game is at, and by extension your confidence is right now?
how are you feeling physically right now?
with an injury like that that's been acting up at times this year, how have you had to adjust your practice, preparations, or even the way that you play the game in order to stay healthy?
can you believe on a positive note here that this is your tenth rogers cup appearance already? what are some of the highlights playing in front of your home fans for you?
when you were a teenager, there was a lot of pressure heaped on you to be the one and to sort of carry the torch for canada to be the top player.
how did that affect you going back?
going forward, do you feel like that confidence is attainable?
kind of further to that, what kind of things is milos going through as the kind of "it" guy on the tour right now or in canadian tennis when he comes to this event and the pressure that comes with it when you see your face on the billboards?
is that kind of how you felt when you were at that stage?
when you look at the attention shifting within the country to obviously milos and to a lesser extent vasek, two guys in their early 20s, do you sort of embrace the role as almost a member of old guard here?
you were married recently. congratulations.
you're by no means old at 27, but do you feel like life and those types of things are drawing you in different directions?
how is married life?
is it nice to finally get another victory un der your belt again? it's been a while.
at what point do you start to get selfconscious about being on a losing streak?
we had donald young earlier today who had his 16th loss in a row. were you aware of that? when you see that, how did you react to it?
what did you take from your previous match with novak into this one that makes you a better player?
can you talk to us a little bit about the olympics experience, what it was like to be at wimbledon with all the pink all over the place and just kind of how you felt after being there two weeks, you know, kind of after the fact?
you said after wimbledon that you needed to change things up a bit and maybe work harder. talk about some of the changes you made, if any.
do you and the players feel that maybe there is an opportunity with some of the top players tired after the olympics?
how do you see self in toronto and draw which one is already done and you are already very successful in first round?
how did you see self with this one draw in toronto and you pass first round?
i have a question regarding winning a grand slam and being a grand slam champion. in a historical aspect, the eighth australian grand slam champion winning the first and reaching the first grand slam final at the age of 19 and 25; the oldest was patrick rafter. you are now 19. i know this is a process. how do you put your development process? what is your expectation to win a title, to win a grand slam title?
you cruised through the first set pretty easily, and then things went downhill from there. what happened? what changed?
how frustrating is it to have that happen here in your own backyard basically?
two years ago you knock off jurgen melzer here. the crowd really got behind you in that match. was it different today being a day match? did you feel the same kind of support?
what parts of your game do you have to maybe work on going forward in your future?
anything that went on psychologically that hampered you a bit or you started thinking too much or thinking something was wrong? anything that went on psychologically that you can point to?
how often do you play a guy that hits that many slice backhands to you?
and the forehand pass in the last game, you had a really good chance to get back on serve there. would like to have that one back, i guess.
generally what do you think of his game? it's a little bit different than most guys.
it was one helluva match. seemed to take a lot out of you.
how do you comment on the organization of this tournament this year compared to last year? do you think they improved this year?
five match points came and went. how long is it going to take to get over that one?
and physically how are you holding up now? you seemed to be very stiff and sore, and that was a long match. did you have any difficulties during the match?
the match can go either way. novak said on court he got lucky and you were the better player. do you feel the same?
we've seen this year there's not much between you and novak. is he for you the benchmark of where you need to get to to progress on?
some players can have a bit of a dip after the sort of summer you had, olympics, us open. i imagine you must feel pretty happy with semifinals in tokyo and the final here?
you obviously didn't get the happy ending you were looking for in shanghai. is the emotion one of frustration for you getting so close?
you do sound incredibly philosophical about putting things into place very quickly. it's still very fresh in your mind. is that just purely because of having won a grand slam or is it because of the lady you've been talking to, or you've come to a realization?
have you heard that roger federer recently made a comment on you? he said you may be the future no.1. what do you think of his comment? do you still think you need to make some change for that goal?
you didn't get the character right tonight.
but you got the match right. that's the point. andy just said you are the better player tonight. you said he is the better player.
the first set you lost and seemed very angry. you broke your racquets, bang, bang, bang. the second set andy murray did the same thing.
what did you think at that time?
do you think the mentality determined the results tonight?
at the beginning of the match it seemed that more fans were cheering for andy. as the match went on, more fans turned to cheer for you. did you feel the support?
you lost to rafa in the french open and you lost to roger in wimbledon and you lost to andy murray in the olympics.
finally you beat one of them.
what is the meaning for you for tonight?
do you feel your confidence come back?
you played with andy six times this season, and most of the matches are top quality. do you think the rivalry with andy is the dominant rivalry for the next few years?
often in a rivalry there's a chaser. andy has had that role in your rivalry. do you feel that he's still the chaser or do you think he's evened up now?
you start preparations for the season with the exhibition in abu dhabi. have you also formed plans, and does that include dubai?
barring a calamity over the next few weeks, you're going to end the year ranked no.1. what is it going to mean to you to do that two years in a row?
was that as well as you played against him? you played well here in the final two years ago. but is that even more aggressive?
you've obviously beaten roger a number of times now. is there always something a bit special about beating him, considering his status in the game?
both times it was a rain delay, it was roger leading the charge to the umpire's chair to stop the match. both times it was key points. how frustrating is that?
how surprised are you to see roger doublefault three times? did that give you an indication of the pressure he was under?
bestofthree sets opposed to a bestoffive, does that change your approach to the match at all?
last two big matches you played, you had one guy holding things up with a medical timeout before you're serving for the match and you've had half an hour rain delay. what goes through your mind? how do you keep calm? do you turn off?
can you talk a little bit about your relationship with novak. i know you came up through the juniors together. you've practiced here this week. do you consider yourself friends, just colleagues?
the final tomorrow. a rematch of the us open final. i think you and novak are the same age. you trained together here monday or tuesday. have you ever thought about you were going to meet him in a final when you trained together?
when you came back on court after the second break, the crowd were chanting roger's name. what was going through your mind at the moment?
i don't remember it happened in your career, three doublefaults in one game.
any other comment on the match?
on the serve, was that the area of your game you perhaps didn't get going well enough tonight?
did you notice a difference in the way andy played tonight compared to the us open and when you met him at the olympics?
roger, you set yourself this goal of world no.1 by the end of the season.
does this result affect it in any way?
you decided to come to shanghai at the last moment. you have a flexible schedule and can't promise anything. but the fans care the most. will this time be the last time we will see you in shanghai?
do you have a plan to play beijing next year?
firstly, you drawed your name, then you drawed china. what is next?
actually, it's wrong sequence.
the character is right, but wrong sequence.
on the match today, pretty commanding performance once again. why is it that you play so well when you play tomas?
about tomorrow's final. you said on court you choose neither federer or murray, you don't want to face them.
my question is, what are you prepared to do?
on andy murray, since wimbledon when he made the final, what have you noticed that has changed about him on court?
if it is andy, does the word 'revenge' come in at all?
you're obviously winning the chinese crowd over. have you thought about maybe incorporating some traditional clothing into what you do?
one thing i know, the chinese love lucky red undies, underwear.
i want to ask a question about the big four: you, andy, roger and rafa. you have won the past four year grand slams except the us open 2009 and all the atp 1000 masters this year. i just asked the same question to tomas. he said it's too tough to win a title. so what do you think about it?
just say something about the match. i think maybe you played better at the end of the first set, but just couldn't do it in the second.
the crowd seemed like they wanted you to win more, they were cheering with you. we're in the era of the big four. they're the biggest stars of this sport. don't you think it's kind of a backfire, they want a player outside the big four to win more?
why do you think you have such a poor record against novak? why do you struggle against him so much?
you move on to abu dhabi next. you're going to be part of this development of grassroots that they're starting. why is it important for you to be part of such a thing?
let's talk about the big four. do you think it's positive or negative for the development of the tennis that they won all the grand slams and masters 1000s?
have you had a chance to enjoy yourself in shanghai?
the next one coming up against andy. you have had a couple good ones of late. what have you learned from the last two that you split about his game that you can bring to the table as an advantage tomorrow?
this is the 10th year since shanghai had its big first tennis tournament in 2002. you're here seven times. i guess you're the right player to ask about the progress, development, how you feel about this the tournament, tennis as a whole?
over the last few years, probably nobody has played murray more than you. i'm wondering what kind of input paul brings to the table with andy, having worked within the british setup, lta, davis cup.
i was trying.
you mention andy is a more offensive player than he used to be. do you think that is what made the difference to him this summer in winning the olympics and the us open?
tomas is kind of on the fringe of you four guys. why do you think he hasn't broken through?
as somebody who takes a political role in the atp, i'm curious how you feel about the combined events, not at the slams? do you like them? don't you like them? why?
the match is not what the score shows. seems like you had some problems with your serve.
in last days in press conference you told us you tried to put some influence on your friends, especially teenagers. you know many people admire you because you are such a household star. in fact, you are looking forward to university life. you said one day you can go to university and study linguistics or psychology. do you want to say something to chinese teenager fans or give them some advice on their studies or daily life?
what do you think about tomorrow's match?
you mentioned bernard tomic the other night. i know you practiced with him. he's struggling a little with his motivation at the moment. do you still he has what it takes to get to the top? what are your thoughts on him at the moment?
he said he only tried 85% the other day when he lost. does that surprise you?
you looked really fresh out there. a dramatic difference to the end of last season. how do you feel?
can i have your comments on roger federer's 300 week record. can you tell how hard this record could be. do you think you will copy that? do you feel that is his talent or you can do that again now by practice?
talk a little bit about the match today, what you felt you did well to beat jo.
tomorrow will either be novak or...
this year the four grand slam winners have been murray, nadal, djokovic and federer. they've been talked about for a long time as being out on their own as the top four, then everybody else. what do you have to do in your game, do you think, to match them consistently?
outside of the grand slams, are you a fan of the combined events or do you think there's too many? what's the problem when you're at them, if you have any?
obviously your schedule is going to be a little bit more crowded this final push with the davis cup. talk about the importance of the davis cup for you and for the country.
almost 35 years in a few weeks. quarterfinals here.
so how do you live this amazing story? is it an amazing story for you to be in the quarterfinals here?
do you have any special explanation about the fact that you are doing very well here? you also made the quarters three years ago here. is it something to do with the atmosphere, the surface?
are you already thinking about the davis cup final? in your preparation are you preparing in a way for the davis cup final?
it's been a good tournament, like you say. can the renaissance continue against andy murray? he destroyed dolgopolov 62, 62 this evening.
what did you change precisely for the end of the year?
you play both singles and doubles. how do you do it physically? is it hard work physically to play both?
i'm sure you've been asked this question many times before. at 33, going strong, what more do you think you can contribute to the sport, what can you give to the younger generation?
considering you had a walkover in the previous round, you must have been pleased the way you were into your stride pretty quickly today.
could you elaborate on how the conditions are? is it slower or quicker? seemed chilly tonight out there.
andy, roger said in his preevent interview that you can become world no.1 next year or even at the end of this year. do you have that confidence to become world no.1, especially after you won your first grand slam?
i just want to know what kind of books do you read, who are your favorite writers?
you mentioned a difference after you won the us open. for example, you were more relaxed going to practice. have you been enjoying doing the press more and more?
going into the press more relaxed than before?
when i see this match, i can see that you controlled the match pretty well. but in the second set when you were broken, you threw the racquet. i want to know how did you feel at that particular moment? why were you a little bit impatient at that time?
outside of the grand slams, are you a fan of the combined events? do you think there's too many?
you said the other day you felt relieved after your won your first grand slam title. after li na won her first grand slam title, i think there's more pressure for her and she wasn't happy about it. it was more like a burden. share some thoughts on that. maybe a difference between men and women or something else.
can i get your thoughts on your next match, on radek stepanek?
do you feel like your return let you down today? your serving seemed like it was okay.
are these the matches that are kind of your stumbling block?
what is next for you? where do you go?
is it just different, too, being on other court, the center court?
can you put a finger on it? you played pretty well here. i guess today when you started the match, did you not feel that great?
got to put my newzealand hat on. are you coming back to auckland to play in january?
is it fair to say that maybe you prefer a slightly slower court surface than what is here?
you played long matches and tiebreaks. did you notice that?
why?
you were in deep trouble there. tell us how you dug yourself out of that hole.
after this win, you will definitely have over 300 weeks as the world no.1. will you say something about that.
shall we bring your memory back to february 2nd, 2004, your first week at no.1. do you still remember the excitement?
you are 31 years old, same age as li na. she was always pissed off when she was asked about retirement. you've been asked about that a lot. have you ever been tired of such thing?
talk about your friend stan. he has been always living under your shadow, like today. people were cheering for you, all the court. they were almost cheering for stan's unforced errors. do you have mixed feelings about beating your friend?
a moment ago you used the word 'satisfaction.' you won today, broke a record. you've been breaking records for so long, you're breaking your own records. that satisfies people that watch and follow tennis. knowing that really satisfies the thousands of people that were watching today, what really satisfies you?
you've heard this one before, but it seems like the serve is still working very well. 12 aces i think today.
time and time again people have been saying 'greatest era'. is it a fair reflection of how things actually stand between the four of you in that each of you has won a major this year?
last year, this time of the year, you struggled after the us open. you were physically struggling a bit.
what has been the difference this year? you're obviously playing well now. is it because you're not carrying any injuries or have you paced yourself better through the year?
we talked about a nobel prize winner the other day and you said you read a lot. what are you reading now and what is your favorite writer?
in beijing you told us chinese fans are very good at presents. any special ones you got this year? you need more suitcases to go back to europe?
you might play janko in the quarterfinals. i think you reached the top 10 when you were 19. he reached it when he was 27. why do you think it took him longer to get to the top?
back to the davis cup situation. a lot of words have been written and spoken whether the top guys really rate davis cup. nobody is more patriotic for their country than you in the top four. how hard was it for you to turn your back on the davis cup this year?
what did you do this year when serbia played in davis cup? were you there? did you watch it on tv, ignore it altogether?
you talk to janko and troicki and zimonjic?
you are the national hero or icon for your own nation. so is li na for china. it feels like more of a burden for li na. can you share some thoughts on that?
much different game than what you had yesterday. very tough battle out there today.
your next point is no stranger to you: jowilfried tsonga.
when did you first find out that florian wasn't going to be able to play?
a good thing? would you have preferred to play today? will you practice again?
will you be watching your next opponents at all, their match?
you're a young guy and have had a lot of success. compared to roger federer, you're relatively new to this. are you amazed by the fact that he still has so much desire, wants to hang in there, that he does so well at 31?
you spoke about relief yesterday after winning the us open. how have you changed as a person?
there's all this talk about maybe sir andy murray or you'll be on the obe list. does that have any meaning to you? not so important in the scheme of things?
has anything surprised you about the reaction or the response to your us open win?
last weekend you were coming in from tokyo, so i'm not sure whether you got here in time. roger was seeing all the powers that be, wimbledon people were here, tim was here. did you get involved in those talks or did you arrive too late?
so from your perspective it's all steam ahead now, the australian open is on, everything is fine, all those threats have gone away now?
there's a couple more big events before the end of the season. talk about your level of freshness and motivation at this stage.
in terms of winning another one, obviously there are different kinds of hard courts. is the australian open as suitable for you as the us open proved to be in terms of conditions?
it seemed pretty straightforward. can you talk about the match, how you felt about it.
i assume you felt no worry about the death threat or anything, you felt comfortable?
you always have been an alltime favorite in shanghai. tonight i think the crowd wanted lu to win more. what do you think about that?
you say your last matches were on clay obviously. you're a man that always comes in prepared. i'm assuming you've been practicing on hard courts. were you in dubai or in switzerland?
when was the decision made to come here?
that late?
do you know you are match away from securing 300 weeks at no.1?
it is correct.
you keep winning.
in china a microblogging service has over 274 million users, including andy murray, serena williams, maria sharapova, li na. will you use that because your fans here are looking forward to following you?
a microblogging service.
finally china has not only one but two players in the top 200. this is the first time it's happened in the past 10 or something years. do you realize the progression they've made? have you practiced with any of them in shanghai?
you say you feel like you'll be able to play another few years if you stay healthy. i would suspect the little ones are getting closer to school age. have you thought about how you would deal with that, whether you would travel without them?
you mentioned the security. are you aware the guy who apparently posted the threat apologized? any thoughts on that?
when you were here last time, 2010, you were alone. what have you been doing to kill your time in shanghai?
you meant to practice on court 4 today with zhang ze. it didn't happen. do you think he will have a chance to practice with you?
there's a famous football player nicolas anelka that came to watch your match. did you know that? it seems you have a lot of (indiscernible) with football, brazil, do some work with football teams. is that true?
you served four games at love and never lost more than one point on your service game. you must be pretty pleased with your serving today.
in your recent message of your facebook, you quote a nobel prize winner's words: there's no greater task than to support somebody's development. can you tell us why this sentence makes you so impressed.
a less philosophical question. do you think the sport misses rafa, that there is a certain energy and excitement that is missing at tournaments when rafa isn't here?
i have two questions. firstly, i noticed that after the match you used chinese to say thanks to the chinese audience. who did you learn this chinese sentence from? how long have you been practicing? secondly, we know you are the happy man on the court. you have special ways to celebrate. for example, you imitate sharapova or federer or do the horse dance gangnam style. if you win the championship this time, will you have any special ways to celebrate? can you tell us beforehand?
getting back to philosophical questions. i'm wondering, you speak so many languages. you can happily go from italian to english. now you're sort of thinking about chinese as well. were you good at school? your immediate contemporary from scotland admits his school days were pretty much a waste of time.
we'll, he's admitted it.
did your brothers go to school?
regular school?
where did you pick up all the languages?
and the english?
murray's match was arranged after your match. while you were competing, murray got into the next round. what do you think? the second question is, i heard you caught a cold in beijing. what is your situation now?
following up on rafa. we're in an era now where we've had for the last three, four years four great players. rafa is injured at the moment. roger is 31. at some stage he will stop playing. do you think that will be a problem for tennis in two or three years' time if there's no rafa, no roger? i'm sure yourself and andy will still be there. there doesn't appear to be anyone immediately who you would think is going to join your level. do you think that will be a problem having had such a great era until now?
do you consider yourself now a selfeducator in the way that jim courier did? he finished high school, but he read a lot, was insistent upon experiencing the places he went beyond the tennis courts, the hotel and the airports. you seem knowledgeable about the world beyond the tennis.
do you read a lot?
before today's match we know that you will have to play with kei, who is a very good player. how did you get yourself prepared?
last year in the press conference we asked what his impressions was of the chinese players. the only player he mentioned is you. he watched your practice. what do you think of it?
you talked about playing the grand slams. i think this is already a very good performance for a chinese player. how do you think you can participate in these highend tournaments?
what kind of plans?
you mentioned your new coach. can you talk more about your new coach. what kind of help is he giving you?
li said he wants to fly solo when his ranking is 100. what about you?
were you injured in the second set? what happened?
you couldn't summon the effort; is that what you're saying?
i guess it comes pretty soon after the us open when there's a bit of controversy late in the match. how do you respond to that?
is part of it because it's your second year on the tour; people perhaps were surprised by your first year and the second year they know a bit more how you play?
when people talk about the next generation of players, people talk about guys like raonic, nishikori, yourself. do you think in a way, bearing in mind your age, you're a couple years younger than those guys, people expect too much of you?
you talked about pressure before, people expecting so much more. how do you go about dealing with that? is there something you can do to help you cope?
you spoke at wimbledon that there were some personal issues going on; you weren't happy with your own effort on the practice court. has anything changed since then?
back to the us open, you talked about the mental problems. can you say you gave 100% out there today?
how has it worked this year being based in europe? has that been a good thing?
i wanted to know what your plans are now for the rest of the year.
you just won in japan, so you've been playing quite a bit of late. you did really well here last year, so maybe you have some confidence going forward in the tournament. how are you going to treat your body to make it through two straight weeks of playing tennis?
there's been a lot of talk about security at this tournament in the last couple days. i'm curious, what have you heard about the sort of antijapanese rallies that occurred in shanghai three weeks ago? was there ever any concern for you to maybe not come to this tournament?
that was quite the battle. talk about it, what it was like playing it.
you had one match point at 76 in the second set tiebreaker. talk about that.
is that one of the matches that you say, this is why it's exciting to play tennis, when you're playing that quality, it's so close, or do you just like to get out of there?
it was the longest match in terms of games played at this tournament ever. do you enjoy setting records?
is the most pleasing aspect the fact that you're three match points down in the thirdset tiebreak and you dig deep to get out of that hole?
finally a home tie. you have never played, and i know sam has never played a home tie. obviously you'll likely be there. talk about that.
can you ever remember a match where you won and didn't break serve? how does that sort of shift your focus going into the next round knowing you were unable to break?
what did you take out of that? serve wasn't at its best tonight.
physically everything was good?
now that you've had a little time to reflect on davis cup, it was disappointing, but do you feel your body is up to three matches in a row for the future? was that something you feel needs to sort of be tactically tweaked as to how to best use you in circumstances like that?
bernie had a pretty lame last second set today. he was asked if he gave 100%. he said about 85%. how does it make you feel, for someone that gives 200% when you go out there, what kind of advice can you give him?
some fans just cry when they saw you wave your hands on the court because they still remember a lot about you, especially when you won the masters cup in shanghai. do you still remember the first championship news conference in shanghai when you won the masters cup? do you still remember that?
what are your plans now?
the offseason, any particular priorities this time?
and brisbane this time?
since we're talking about history, andy roddick retired this year, marat safin retired a couple years ago. roger jokingly said before he might play until he was 35 or something. what about you? do you have a plan?
you are in this sport for so many years. we are in the world of the big four. do you have any comment on this competition, the four top players competing against each other and won everything? little room for the rest of the other players. what do you think about that?
this whole thing of education with sport. you had a chance, a scholarship coming up, and you turned it down. do you ever regret it, yes or no, either way?
you and john isner are seen as the next sort of stars taking over from guys who are already on the wane. do you find yourself under pressure? how do you take that into consideration?
sam, can you talk a little bit about today, the match, what you felt you did right...
are you feeling like you're still coming back from the right elbow surgery or do you feel you're all back? what is your mindset on that?
looking ahead, you could play nishikori next, who had great success in his home country. your thoughts if you do come up against him, his game?
the other night the players met to discuss the prize money issue with the slams. were you part of that meeting? do you feel you made some progress?
you're happy with what they've already done with the move at the australian open?
you just were talking about knowing you were ready to go pro or to college. a lot of kids all seem to think they're ready to go pro. i say from my expertise of being around a long time, a lot of them aren't. what is the deciding factor?
when you were away some time because of the elbow injury, what were you thinking about during that time? what is the biggest change or the most important thing that your new coach has brought to you?
it's been kind of an odd tournament all around, hasn't it? you not playing as many matches as you thought you probably would. how did you feel going into the final today? fully up for it and ready to go?
did you feel sluggish at all? at times it looked like you were a little bit sluggish. perhaps it was just frustration.
you said in australia that you felt the gap was closing. two months along, do you feel that's still the sort of direction you're headed?
is it hard for you that it seemed like in the longer rallies you easily held your own, perhaps won more of the longer rallies than he did.
what makes him so good? why is he so tough to beat?
apart from the return, was there anything of your original game plan that you didn't manage to execute?
in the second set, there were a couple occasions where you caught your toss and then you doublefaulted, which turned out to be the difference in the tiebreaker. was there anything going on at that point?
did that contribute at all to your double faulting, do you think?
good to close it out in the tiebreaker?
how eager were you to get out of there in just two sets? that second set went long.
some of the other guys, they almost make a big deal of being out there, making it go a long time. with murray sometimes it's hard to tell. looks as if he's almost out of it but yet he seems very close and ready to turn it around.
the three titles you've won here, can you just say what each one has meant to you and how each one is different.
the three matches that you mentioned, they were almost the same. is it that you laid back a little bit on the second match [sic], you know, with these players? because you are confident that in the end if you step up you're gonna win, or...
how important is this result for the clay season that comes now and roland garros?
is miami your favorite?
some people would have thought that with andy murray having two walkovers and you've played so many matches in the last several weeks that maybe you would be tired and he would be fresher. did you feel that way at all going in?
the win last year came in the middle of the start of that incredible run of wins. where do you think your game is now compared to a year ago? do you think it's possible to repeat one like that?
after you win a championship like this, do you allow yourself to go to the bakery, or are you very strict...
are you very strict about your no bread, no pasta?
what about your spirit this year compared to last year? last year you were clearly a man on a mission. now it's almost like you're beyond that point, you're somewhere else. can you talk about that?
you seem pretty comfortable with no.1. how do you feel lately on the court? are you feeling that there is a bigger gap between you and the rest of the players?
did the heat affect the performance today? the heat?
practice court session before the game against monaco, you hit a home run. are you a baseball fan? how much is having fun part of your game plan?
i'm guessing you're feeling as strong physically as you ever have. are you a little curious yourself to see what kind of game you have on clay this season to find out?
perhaps you could just take us through the situation you're faced with. we assume it's your knee. could you tell us the story of the last couple of days?
can you describe the problem exactly for us? do you know what it is precisely?
because obviously you want to protect as best you can for the clay court season coming up? you say just going out there and running around on the hard court is not going to do you any good in the long run?
what is your clay court schedule? what are the chances that that may change now?
how worrying is it to have the same thing happen again with your knee when you thought it was fixed?
so where are you going now? where are you going from here? are you going back to mallorca?
did you have any problems coming out of your training in february? when you went to indian wells, everything was good?
is it described as tendinitis or something else?
you always play with a lot of injuries. are you more cautious now? because you always play with i remember us open when you have the other thing. are you more cautious now?
is it fair to say this is one of the stranger weeks of your tennis career, two walkovers?
will you have any anxiety about not having had enough court time going into the final?
can you actually recall going on court, preparing to play a lefthander, and suddenly find yourself half an hour later playing someone who's righthanded preparing for another match?
i know there is a rivalry, but how much of you says, hey, good, i'll take this?
did you speak to rafa today?
a strange match. is it difficult to keep your concentration when a guy is playing as poorly as he did in the first set?
was it important for you to avoid the third set, considering andy murray didn't have to play today? was that important to get off the court quick?
ferrer and monaco did a little bit of the same game. which one was harder for you?
can you discuss the 26shot rally in the tiebreak, how important that was and what happened?
do you recall that point in particular in the tiebreaker, the 26...
can you talk about facing andy murray on sunday and the fact that he didn't play today? do you think that will affect him one way or the other, or what do you expect from sunday?
at times you are so confident that you accommodate yourself a little bit and step up when it's really needed. you were always a guy that gave so little break. how do you feel at this new time in your career?
(in spanish.)
yes.
i think he's talking about juan monaco.
he's asking how you felt about monaco's tournament.
your first serve percentage today was kind of low. i was wondering if that was frustrating. is that something you're gonna work on?
are you at all concerned that you had a bit of a letdown in the second set, the kind you can't afford against some of the better players?
do you see any difference i know it's a short time in andy, physically or mentally with his game, since he's been working with ivan? or too soon to tell?
that was particular a tough day today, especially at the net?
did you expect the match to be that hard? from watching him play andy and stuff, did you expect it to be the kind of match it was, or was it different than what you thought?
you know, obviously this was a big opportunity, you're the last standing american, i know how much it would have meant to you to make the final and stuff like that here. can you just talk about do you feel like it was a lost opportunity?
from your tennis point of view, do you consider this as a bit of a step back from the almagro match, or the positives you can take away from this?
there seemed to be some visible frustration by you after the match. is that normal after any loss, or was there something about today's match that sort of disappointed you more?
just a little bit of a racquet slam.
did it feel like a davis cup tie?
just picking up from what you just said, the fact that the center court is very different from the other courts, last night tsonga said it took him two sets to figure out how the court worked. is it really that different? if it is that different, is it something that you may want to kind of doing something about? it's obviously a big factor.
someone needs to spend two sets to get used to the court?
going more towards the difference between the center court and the outside, what do you think it's...
you're not usually one to complain or anything, but would you say that if you had had another match on center court during this tournament, especially as the topranked american, that that might have helped you today?
a good turnaround from 2love down, second set, with the way things were going then?
can you just explain what the conditions you were having when you called the doctor on was?
when you had your treatment, that would coincide with quite a fast improvement. was it the treatment or the fact you got your game together?
on a day like today when you're not feeling well, any thoughts maybe of changing your tactics or being a little bit more aggressive as opposed to long baseline rallies? i mean, it worked, obviously, but...
can you talk a little bit about the semifinals, both guys you might be seeing?
after indian wells, how good does that feel to be this far?
unrelated to the match, just a question about your mom. she's the captain for the fed cup. did it change the dynamic of the family since she got into that?
well done. the score didn't quite reflect the match. it was a bit tougher than that, wasn't it?
in the first set you took a trainer break. new injury? left knee? is it okay?
it's rumored that you stepped down from the atp player council. can you just explain to us about why you made that decision.
you have played kei previously three times and this is the fourth time. did you feel like he played differently this time or did you see any progress?
you said before kei will be a top 10 in the future. you say before. so do you have same opinion right now?
16.
just back to the player council thing, can you tell us what areas you suggested you have been very frustrated.
can i just ask you a little bit about slow play, rafa? there were situations today where the match on grandstand had played five games before the match on stadium court even started.
why is that?
don't you think there should be an obligation to actually start the match at 11:00?
over on grandstand with an 11:00 start they played five games before you had even started your match.
i just wonder, if the time of the match says 11:00, should the players be on the court at 11:00?
i have a question about david ferrer. he's been in the top 5 for so many years and never won a grand slam or masters series. do you have any idea why?
nice just to get a match in after sort of three or four days of practice just to get back into a competitive environment again?
talk a little bit aboutthat. it said 17 minutes on the tv. some people practically play a set, and that was one game.
does this week have a different feel for you because ivan is here, as opposed to last week when he didn't come? are the weeks that he's coming around different, or how so are they different?
he's never coached before; has he adapted in your mind?
was another attraction to him possibly that he's a guy who proved that you can lose your first three, four grand slam finals and then come back and win a whole bountiful of them?
obviously a longer match than you wanted, but your serve, when you needed it, is that as sweet as you could serve?
in the 43 third set, the break game, he seemed to almost give it to you. were you surprised by a couple of the unforced errors?
you said that was probably the best shot you hit all year. does this feel like the best round win you've gotten all year?
did you watch andy and roger last night?
what do you think of how andy played? you might maybe have a chance to play him. i'm assuming on stadium court.
yeah, you should keep requesting it. play the final out there.
what about if you have to face him? technically and emotionally a guy you know so well and where he's playing right now.
that's what he said. last time he said he lost to davydenko in the next match after he beat roger here.
how did you feel in the game today?
you joked about being on grandstand for the next match. you have been on the second court through indian wells and here. is that surprising for you, being the no.1 american?
sorry to ask you to look ahead, but davis cup team was announced today. how fired up are you after what happened with the swiss? are you more fired up now that you have a nice little run going now?
have you played the montecarlo tournament?
what was your...
(indiscernible.)
you mentioned that one of isner's best surfaces is clay. he's actually going over to play montecarlo. do you feel like he's sort of a different mold of american player than has come up the last 10 years? yourself, andy, sampras before you not playing a whole lot of optional...
you have been chasing this guy, roddick, your whole life.
seems like he's finally going away; you're the topranked american. don't you just want this guy to go away already? tell us the truth.
who's better on the basketball courts, you or him?
are you undecided about the olympics?
if you didn't do it, what would be the reason why?
when will you decide?
after the french? will you wait till the last minute?
you're not ready to say which way you're gonna go, though?
are you working with mark knowles now?
how did that happen? is it temporary?
can you give us an example of something he's taught you, some tip he gave you, something that helped you?
when did you start working with him?
is he still entering more tournaments?
it was a bit of a slow start for you in the beginning. did you feel you were going to do the job in two sets today?
were you in total surprise to see roger federer to go out of the tournament yesterday with andy roddick playing so well?
can you see yourself winning this tournament again this year? do you feel healthy to do that?
you had an incredible last year, 2011 and some good results this year. how is it defending these titles and following up a fantastic last year going into this year? how do you keep your motivation?
how did you feel in the game?
yes.
the sort of younger players, a group of players who have yet to properly emerge, how far away do you think they might be from being able to challenge the likes of you?
i'd prefer you to name some if you will.
sort of the dimitrov, tomic thing. you've played a few of these guys from that generation.
i hear that you like the morning matches. you prefer them and actually request them. give us a reason why.
what time do you go to bed?
give us a time.
so you like to know my match is at 11:00 instead of having to wait it out?
you okay at grandstand stadium at this point?
did they give you that option or not today?
kevin is a tough out. saw him delray.
started off a little slow. what turned it around for you?
looking ahead, you have a tough quarter there, talking about playing the big names ahead. can you talk about how you feel going ahead? are you looking forward to going to the next challenges?
before you go to bed tonight will you watch roger and andy go at it?
andy was saying the other day he's, what, 221 or whatever against roger but he's excited for the chance.
like the wimbledon final?
wind it back to the us open. would you have foreseen roger's run? i mean, two matches lost since the us open. did you sort of envisage that he could do that?
are you working with mark knowles?
like what's your relationship there?
is this going to be ongoing thing or a weektoweek thing?
what would you call him, your assistant coach?
has mark coached before?
how would you say the penn balls at this tournament play compared to like wilson balls and other types of balls at the tournaments?
not last night, mardy. did you see john? did you talk to him at all?
did you talk to him at all about it?
he checked out at4all. he really lost patience with the match.
yeah. he lost his serve at 4all, and after that...
he said he's going home to practice on clay.
do you feel your form is getting better with matches?
about the net incident, do you remember anything like this?
i have quite a general question. a few years ago, like before you started playing, the big clich was clay is a slow surface and the other surfaces are fast. it doesn't seem this way anymore. it seems like sometimes clay can be faster than hard. can you assess how you look at the situation?
even the grass.
speaking about the fact that you were just talking about, how much you had changed tactically between different surfaces? if i think about last year, you pretty much won wimbledon and the masters series on clay with the same.
i haven't seen you since australia, but i notice that you've gone to your hometown. i think you had a couple weeks' holiday. the time you spend there, is that kind of like a real treasured holiday for you? because i'm presuming you don't go there very often.
i was wondering if you liked the 60 minutes special that aired last night? i was going to ask you to elaborate on something that you and a lot of players from serbia have talked about, and that is how growing up in that country during those hard times has made you hungrier for success. can you like elaborate on that? why do you think that is? how does that manifest itself?
what would you say the spin potential is of the penn balls at this tournament compared to other balls like wilson or dunlop balls?
this visit back to your place of birth, do you still know people there? have relatives there? did you actually sort of walk past those courts where you learned to play?
juan martin del potro he's coming back to the top 10. you faced him last year. do you see him as a potential top 5 this year?
you're playing gasquet next. can you talk about things in his game that you feel make you confident going into the game? they always ask you about the player's strengths. what are the weaknesses you spot, and how comfortable do you feel going into the match?
you had a little trouble at the end of the first set, i think. how was that in the end when you had your treatment?
how challenging is it for you now you're a father and you have your family with you usually? is it hard for you when you have to focus in your matches but then you have to give the little one attention?
how do you regard your matchup with andy murray?
so you're just a little anxious about your physical condition; is that fair?
how would you say that the penn balls at this tournament play relative to the balls at other tournaments?
i mean the balls, tennis balls.
how do the penn tennis balls play relative to the balls at other tournaments?
how do the penn balls at this tournament play?
but compared to like wilson balls.
you are one of the best players in france and you have injuries. you usually play the top players really close. so do you feel a lot of pressure not being physically well when you have just to step it up against the best players?
what actually happened?
what did they tell you about it?
do you have any doctors that you can talk to about it?
puts you in your next match where?
how frustrating is this for you? just when things go well, suddenly there is another hiccup, whether it's minor or bigger injury or anything like that.
are you heading straight to europe?
is this going to affect in any way your preparation for the clay court season?
can you say your decision was partly influenced by the caliber of opposition you were going to be up against today?
it's your first win over a top 10 opponent. talk about your feelings breaking over that threshold.
what was the key for you today to win?
will you do anything special to celebrate your first top 10 win?
could you give us an idea of how difficult it is playing the senior tour as opposed to the junior tour and making, you know, backtoback wins? because you can have a good result and then you have got to be able to rebound the next day and do it all over again.
has your new coach have an influence on that win?
you had a very serious training during christmas. seems like everything's coming together now, right? how much has to do with this kind of training and start the year and do well?
looking ahead to the next match against tipsarevic, what do you feel about that?
is there another top 10 win coming up with him, do you think?
we saw serena up there rooting for you right now. can you talk about that friendship a little bit?
just getting an insight into what you expect of yourself and what you feel you need to improve the most  because anybody watching you thinks this guy's got all the shots  what do you think separates you from where you are now outside the top 100 and where you want to be?
what do you need to do with your game or your approach?
the australian open it was very hard for patrick because he had you and jeremy chardy playing. it was a spectacular match, so tough. how tough was it for you to play a friend and somebody...
do you think maybe a lack of motivation in the past has caused you not to realize your potential? is this the kind of win you need to get motivated to get to the next level?
not a bad first match, andy. pretty flawless today. how did you feel out there?
your backhand pass seemed as good as ever.
emotionally what does that do for you? everything is going right. what does that do for you, all you've been through?
are you mentally able to just say, okay, let's just forget what happened this year and...
looking briefly past this tournament for a second, how do you keep up the momentum through clay? is that hard?
do you know who you have next?
speaking of thingscoming, you said, i have a feeling something good is coming. roger federer?
speaking of ryan, 19, you remember you were 19 here. took out pete, a signature moment. can you put yourself in ryan's what he may be feeling?
put yourself in his position. do you feel this is coming to the kid, maybe not today but...
completely different topic: a few days ago fernando gonzlez retired. he's planning a farewell tour in chile. you're one of the names he would be like to be on that tour, andy roddick. i wanted to ask you any chance if you will be going to south america at the end of the year?
come on.
(question regarding tim bradley and manny pacquiao.)
what do you think of pacquiao? you've probably seen pacquiao fight, right?
gustavo kuerten will be in the hall of fame. can you talk about gustavo kuerten, in a few words?
a lot of people say that the top three today are stronger and more powerful than a lot of other generations. what do you feel about that? do you see anything that they have that's more, or not really?
what do you remember about the night that you beat roger here? i mean, i was here. i remember what i remember. but what do you remember about that night?
obviously against roger you want to have it all going for you. did you look at the stat sheet? your service percentage was really...
do you feel good about yourself the way you crept back into the second set and were right there to possibly push him?
you've played roger before. todaywhat was different? what was more difficult? are you getting closer?
what was your perspective on the point where the fan shouted out and roger stopped playing?
what is your mentality when you play roger? andy has played him like 23 times and it's been sort of a career frustration. what is your mentality when you go into a match against a guy like that?
but i mean specifically you're playing one of the best players of all time...
what specifically is he doing now better? you said he was playing better this time. can you be more specific?
do you feel like you're getting closer to another breakthrough? what separates you from the top 25, the top 10? or will you need to, you know, stagnate for a little while to get ahold on this and then have another breakthrough?
at this point, i don't think you care about like commiseration at the net, but can you share what roger said to you at the net?
can you talk about the game where you broke in the ninth game, 54, there? what were you thinking right after that? the crowd is excited. that was a big break right there.
well, during and after.
(question regarding the clay court season.)
are you setting yourself a certain round that you want to get to in a masters 1000? do you want to get to a certain ranking?
did you execute today's game plan as you envisioned? in hindsight is it too soon for you to tell yourself what you should have or could have done differently?
but sometimes we execute and yet the other person...
what did you think of ryan? i guess he played a little better in the second set he was saying. what were your impressions of him?
do you feel like the "out" call by the fan threw you off a little bit?
how long did it take to put that point behind you?
no lingering effect then?
how were the conditions today?
ryan just said that he thinks you're hitting your shots with more authority than you were last year. would you agree with that?
you talked before about how you liked having the opportunity to play players from different generations. this year you have already had a chance to play harrison, raonic, tomic. how would compare them to each other having played all three?
would you evaluate them at all?
yeah.
it looked like the ball was going through the air very quickly. what was your feeling?
are you sending a message to a kid like that, hey, the old guy is not ready to go yet? and maybe talk about playing andy for the next round.
when you have had so much success against someone like andy  it's very lopsided with the numbers, anyway  do you still view him as somebody dangerous? and why so? what is it about his game? what are you expecting from that match?
last week mirka and the girls weren't feeling well. i was wondering how they're feeling this week. what do you do in the household where you're staying to keep yourself immune from the germ? do you play a role in the caregiving at all?
about these young players, when you won your first wimbledon you were almost 22 years old. how long do you think that it will take some of these players born in the '90s will have a grand slam title, be a real contender? what will they have to do to win a grand slam?
how is the body feeling?
you had a great beginning to last season, first time on tour winning some titles, and then succumbed to some injuries. now you're getting back at it, building up the body, like you mentioned. how is it defending the title, and what are your goals for the coming year?
because of that, do you feel that your mind towards tennis is totally different now? you enjoy it a lot more?
you have worked very hard to get where you're at.
first set was a very long set, one hour. how did you feel out there? there were weather conditions; it was a long set.
andy murray, your next opponent, somebody i think you haven't played before. what sort of match do you expect? do you have to do anything differently in your game to combat him?
the way you've been playing, if you had to gauge your level of standard of play, how much higher realistically do you want to be compared to what you're doing at the moment? how much more do you need to improve to come up against somebody like a murray? when you got through today, was it a case of doing what you had to do to get through?
does that in one sense add to the excitement of your potential and what you feel you're capable of doing?
how do you like playing in miami?
what was the difference between the hourlong first set and the second set?
to follow up, who do you think has the biggest serve, you or john isner?
are you learning a little bit from him watching the way he serves? there's the height thing.
who's the first famous tennis player you ever remember meeting, and your greatest and most painful moment in your career?
a nice reassuring win, especially after the memory of last year?
do you feel like this tournament is almost a bit of sort of home tournament in a way with your connection with florida and ivan? does that make it all the better to do well here?
you were one of those players that are independent thinkers when you are on the tennis court, and now you have been working with a different coach. how is it for you to listen to somebody when you have your own mind and your own, you know, view of the game? is it hard?
have you had to tell him?
what do you think having the olympics at wimbledon is going to be like?
are you planning on playing mixed? i'm sorry, i don't know.
what's your thought about the addition of mixed doubles to the olympics?
what was fascinating about it?
how do you feel in the game? because the beginning seemed an even game, but afterwards you found more comfort, you found how you play your better tennis.
what do you think about your opponent?
i have a question about roland garros. what is your best memory related to roland garros?
in general, generally.
how much time do you spend in miami or miami beach?
is it home? do you consider that your home base now? how have you adjusted to the climate here?
i missed indian wells, and i saw there was an interesting quote you gave. you said a lot of things go into tennis matches. you have to make sure you're clear in your mind. was there something off the court bothering you or were you concentrating too hard on techniques you're working on?
did ivan identify anything? did he sort of pick anything up long distance?
it's starting to come together for you. started to get a lot more confidence out there. what do you think is the great difference in your game?
is that maturity a thing above anything else where you lose the first set? compose yourself and get back out there and get it done?
is your coach fining you for racquet costs or verbal abuses or curses?
did you get that on your own or did the coach or your dad or somebody talk about that?
in the third set you seemed very confident. he has very great hands and is a great doubles player. you kept him deep. did you have a different game plan on that third set?
you know who you have next, a pretty good player. you know, he had a bad temper as a kid, too. he almost had to stop playing because of that. good example of that. how about making a statement here? are you ready to make that statement?
did you eat broccoli last night?
like popeye?
is that creamed spinach or regular?
you do look leaner since the australian open. do you feel you lost weight? you had a tough match with andy murray and you were dominating and he just switched it back in his game. you look more fit. do you think it's your diet?
you were at the ritzcarlton, the event, for the foundation. you were giving a lot of your time out there. how is it important for the other players to have the same social consciousness that you do?
this tournament, it means the retirement of gonzlez. i will ask if you are still upset with him because of the olympics.
can you just talk about how you're feeling physically and mentally and just kind of how you're getting through the struggles?
did you feel after the first set that you were kind of rolling along, 51? how good were you feeling at that point? or did you realize with davydenko it's a long match?
is that the frustrating part, that you kind of need a couple of matches in a row? it's kind of like a chicken and egg thing.
the same subject. we're from chile and i didn't hear the whole answer, but i wanted to ask you, have you ever spoken to fernando gonzalez about what happened in that particular match? you had some kind of trouble.
never settled that issue?
speaking of john isner, he went to college; you did, too. here he is at no.10 playing the way he's playing. can you just talk about how he's risen to that point?
do you know if you'll play winstonsalem?
could you talk about what you enjoyed about it last year?
given that it's the week before the open, what kind of niche can it carve out for yourself?
is gonna be the first question in english for you: you come from serbia; you are our brother; you showed you are brave; we love you and we admire you and we are very proud to have you as a serbian.
so how do you feel about this final today?
as you just said, any loss is a bad loss. andy has been so close so many times. you and roger and rafa have all said at various times it's bound to happen for him to win one. if there is any consolation in the loss? you know, is it nice to see andy finally ascend to that hierarchy?
i mean, he looked like a man possessed out there tonight. obviously with the gold medal and just not giving up out there. you have played him so many times on big arenas. talk about the way he played tonight.
the way you fired that last return of the match kind of reminded me of the return you had last year against federer. did you have similar preparation towards that point as you did a year ago?
memorable night. can you remember running so much in a single match? do you think it contributed to what looked like cramping up towards the end?
obviously he, not enjoys, but handles these conditions very well. you don't like them. you didn't like them in your previous match. you know, you got unlucky with net cords and everything else. i think it would be very easy for you to say, this is not going to be my night. obviously the first two sets it looked that way. how did you push through that and get to a fifth set?
talking about the match, can you talk about the frustration and angry at the conditions? you fought to the fifth set. do you think maybe the start of the match was the key to it?
every year the journalist have to decide who is the best player of the year. this year since 2003 is the first year that there are four players who won four different majors, but he won the olympic games plus he was in the final in wimbledon. do you think right now even if the year is not over he deserves to be possibly the no.1 of 2012?
i want to ask you to just reflect on your year, which has been a tremendous year and a lot has gone on. i want to ask particularly what was physically going on with you at the end of the match? what was the problem?
you had some good early wins and then you had some real tough times. you were in the shadow of rafa and roger. you hung in there, kept on going, and then you scored your incredible breakthrough. andy now has persevered through many, many losses and has broken through. my question is: how does a pro deal with that? how does he keep on going? how does he keep his arc of his career going upward?
two years ago after the final you mentioned rafa made one step; last year you made giant step; this year four different men can day, four gentlemen, four musketeers. what do you think about today's men's field? it's so competitive, so close.
does it change your approach for the fight for no.1 in any way? andy murray winning today, does it change in any way your approach to the fight for no.1?
you seemed to play a lot of slice tonight especially on the backhand side especially early in the match. was that a tactic to adjust to him or to adjust to the wind? both?
you came around the net to congratulate him and hug him in a very sporting gesture. you're the first person he sees in an extremely historic moment for britain. what did he seem like to have having won it and what did you say to him?
could you see on his face...
going back to the match a little bit, you spiked that ball into the stands to win the fourth set; can you take us into the into your mind going into the fifth set?
not many people in britain can remember the fred perry match in 1936. you have to be i guess in your 90s to have any memory of that. do you think that the gold medal match for andy murray gave him the selfconfidence, the selfbelief that was the critical psychological issue for him?
i wasn't here for the first question. when you played in australia the long, long match, and this one, can you compare them? was this more difficult because of the wind? also, you were more tired then or today?
the rhythm? everything?
that match in australia he only had obviously started working with ivan lendl. now they have been working together for eight months. what are the main differences that you see? is it mainly mental or is there a change in his game?
what's the key for you to get over this?
do you wish the wind had stayed around? you were doing so well in the wind, much better than novak djokovic.
how difficult is it to play a match over two days?
when you came back in the third set from love2 to 32, you had three bad games, is there any specific reason for that? you made many mistakes at that time.
when you came back from love2, 32 in the third set, you had two bad games at that time.
you're the only person who took one set from djokovic in the us open. i don't know how much comfort there is in that.
how much did you know about yesterday's schedule, and did you two want to play on armstrong to try to be able to get the whole match in?
did you realize you probably wouldn't be able to finish the match yesterday?
you played so well here. your match against tipsarevic is probably the greatest match of the tournament. looking back, are there a lot of positives that you can take out of that?
how about the way you played today? do you feel there was something missing in your game today or just novak was better today?
regarding the match you played on thursday, is there some consolation in the fact that you did give fans really the best match of this us open so far?
yes. everyone was saying it's the best match so far.
now you have to refocus and to play on clay for davis cup. are you ready for that?
yesterday you handled the wind better than novak, but should tennis have been played in those conditions?
a tough question: we live in this era of the top four who are so big and have such experience, big game. there are some who say, then there is a gap with the others, you, tsonga, with tomas. do you think there is a real gap?
can you put your finger on two or three things that make them...
you played your best season of your career at 31. do you think that next year you can maintain your level or even improve?
can you talk about your travel plans to get ready for this davis cup?
you don't even know if you're leaving today, tomorrow?
still hoping to make a final one day depending on how the rankings go, i guess?
first of all, congratulations on the match.
it's a bit of an odyssey i would think the past two days. just sort of describe the difference of yesterday and today. it must be a relief to have that match over with.
you played andy in two pretty big occasions this year with different outcomes both times. what were the differences in the two matches? what do you remember most about that australian open fivesetter?
what are your impressions of the evolution of andy's game and the effect of ivan lendl on him?
does it seem a little strange to be in a grand slam semi and now a final without seeing roger or rafa?
yesterday dave brewer said that four players gave four different opinions about what they wanted to see done yesterday. either move you guys onto the other court to get it started, not get it started. can you share what your opinion was and what your routine was when you left here yesterday?
were you relieved to get out?
did you want to play louis armstrong stadium yesterday while the first semifinal was going on?
you have been in this position before in australia where you had less time to recover for the final. what are the challenges in that? now you have even less time before this final than you did in australia.
obviously you could come away with two major titles this year. it's a great year. you were playing at such an extraordinary level last year. what's the mental journey for you been like, the challenges? obviously you had to come down a little bit from that level and why do you think that happened and how did you tunnel through that?
this is the second time scotland has faced serbia this weekend.
did you watch it together yesterday?
how is your physical status? do you feel fresh or any problems?
newyorkers make a big deal out of the weather, so i feel compelled to ask you this question because it hasn't been asked: murray completed his match in the wind. ferrer was coping better in the wind, you say.
if you had to play all those sets in the wind yesterday, do you think the outcome might have been different?
at the french open final, rafa was in pretty good control; then you really put together an incredible rally, as i recall, like eight games in a row and had the momentum and seemed to be going for it. then the rain came.
so talk about momentum; talk about do things balance out? did you reflect on that at all?
momentum is important in this game.
yes.
if you don't mind one quick one again about yesterday's conditions. as an experienced player, could you look at the tv, could you look at murray's match and realize fully how difficult the wind was? or was it something you really had to experience and you didn't fully understand till you were out there actually playing ferrer?
obviously andy is coming into this having lost his first four slam finals. how difficult must that be for him?
who was happier at the end of the football yesterday?
how tough were the wind conditions today?
how did it affect your serve?
the show must go on, but do you think in this sort of condition the match should be not played, or, i mean, it's impossible because semifinal of a slam, us open. what do you think?
the 62 unforced errors, did the wind contribute to that?
you seemed to make a little bit of an adjustment coming into the net a bit more and found your rhythm. do you think you went away from that late? should you have continued to push forward a little more?
you just stepped off court; tough loss. but months from now, will you look back at the us open this year as an opportunity lost, or will you look at it as a great run with the victory over federer?
you mentioned that you don't think this match should have been played given the conditions. was there any conversation with officials about perhaps not playing this match today?
no?
how do you think that andy handled things? you earlier referenced him handling the conditions a little bit better than you did. do you feel that was throughout? did he adjust a little bit better, you think?
the reason why all the czech and slovak players always have these huge stars. you cannot change, you cannot adjust  of course not at the last minute  the australian player that used the wind, they were always having a low toss. you all have a very huge, long toss. there is no way that you can do something about it when you have conditions like this? i know it's difficult to improvise, but...
yeah, but why all of you?
the us open is over; the davis cup is almost beginning. when will you arrive to buenos aires? what do you think about the series against argentina?
was there a part of you today that hopes that it keeps raining, that maybe you have to play tomorrow or there might be no wind?
can you put into words how that compares with our great matches you've played?
you are playing perhaps the best tennis of your career at age 30 this year. your greatest results in grand slams, the titles that you have won. talk about the way you're playing right now.
when one of the mount rushmore players was eliminated yesterday, roger federer, do you say, this really can be my year, or just another opponent to you? what goes through your mind when you see someone like that is eliminated and you're still in here?
does it make an easier path or do you see this as, this is my opportunity, maybe now or never?
you have come through here so quietly until today. when you walk through new york or you go out to dinner, do people know who you are here?
you took an injury timeout i believe when he was serving for the third set.
you took an injury timeout, medical timeout.
also you are a great player, many great wins, but you play in the era of a man named rafa nadal. talk about that.
and the one thing you learned most from rafa?
back to today for a moment. fourandahalf hours; it was a spectacular match and extremely high level of play out there with an opponent who wasn't going to give in on anything. to come through it, talk about how you feel mentally and physically having prevailed in that contest.
physically are you feeling that you'll be back out on court in a couple of days?
he was up 4 to 1 in the last set. do you think the momentum kind of swung in your favor after he took that fall? seemed like you went on a little run there.
the famous story about you when you were young and you were locked in the shed, why did your coach lock you in the shed?
what did you think inside the shed?
if you reach the final, do you think it will be a phone conversation between you and rafa?
you heard from him today via text? he texted you today?
no, before the match today.
did he give you advice?
can you talk about the match?
particularly here, you've play well here. last two years two quarterfinals in a row. is there something about playing at the us open that brings out your best tennis?
talk about the next match. it's been a while since you've played.
i have heard him described as a brick wall.
i suppose you could call that a slow start, couldn't you, today?
when you're a set and 51 down, do you call on that massive experience that you have now in difficult situations knowing you can get yourself out of it, or do you tell yourself you have to fight to get that clarity?
what did you do specifically to change things up? looked like he was afraid to come to the net. was that part of your game plan after being down 51 in the second?
making him coming to the net more. seemed like he was afraid to be at the baseline and coming up to the net.
how would you describe the level of confidence that you have now and its effect in a match like tonight?
hopefully you won't play on it again this year, andy, but what is it specifically about that court that makes it so tricky?
does it make it difficult as well when you think you're playing on one court and you find out you're not, you're playing on the other one?
obviously we don't know who you're going to be playing in the next round, but if it is roger, can you describe the differences between your two most recent matches and what you think the keys to this one will be?
how were you able to do that when it came around to the olympics?
your turnaround in today's match kind of coincided with the crowd filtering in from the roddick match into armstrong. did you feel that energy from the crowd, as well, coming in?
knowing that you have beaten roger now, what difference can that make mentally?
what would that match depend on if you were to play tomas? what would be the keys to that one?
you mentioned 20 times against roger. does the fact you have beaten him in a final now, or a masters, does that change the dynamic in your own mind about the two of you? you have actually won a big one.
how much of a difference would you say ivan has made to your game at this point and to your mental approach to things?
to describe the difference he's made.
any reason to expect you won't bring that calm into the next couple of matches if you have that opportunity, based on the summer you have had?
how long are your debriefs with lendl after a match and your chats prematch? he's stoney faced sitting in your box. what are the chats like?
is the heat a factor for you here when you get those afternoon times? you mentioned armstrong; you don't like it out there. is the heat more intense out there, as well?
it took a while to get this match played, but at last you got it played and you made short order of it for the most part. talk about the match itself.
were you surprised that stan retired from the match? i mean, he took the medical timeout in the third set. if he had an injury, didn't seem like it was affecting him too much beforehand.
what is the routine you have to keep your focus and to keep the warmup yesterday and today?
obviously it's a frustrating scenario that you're faced with and you have had to face a few before and you haven't gotten straight answers. i would imagine there is a sense among players that share your point of view and that there is some exasperation.
does that detract from the overall experience of coming here and playing?
is it frustrating from a scheduling perspective too in that your first three rounds are being done over the course of nine days and now you have to play four matches in five days assuming there is not a monday final here?
when you have asked about these covers, you said they have said it's a good idea. have they given you any explanation why they haven't done it?
how do you feel about the way you played? moving on from the buildup to it.
roddick or del potro next round.
all the top guys seem to be sailing through at the moment here. do you feel like the drama is about to start in this tournament in the quarterfinal stage?
are you watching your rivals playing on tv?.
you're scheduled for the night match tomorrow night. obviously if andy gets through, how much will you enjoy that atmosphere almost playing the villain?
quarterfinals in all four grand slams. you, federer, murray, and assuming djokovic. what do you think of that?
you only dropped one set this tournament so far. can you explain how you are feeling heading into the next round?
despite having had such a great run with all the attention focused on the top three, you have been under the radar screen. how has that affected you?
all the attention has been on the top 3. has that been to your advantages?
why do you think you're better now than three, four, five years ago?
first time back in a grand slam quarterfinal for a while.
i guess you're happy with that.
has that been the big difference, just confidence of winning matches?
you're one of a group of young, big, powerful guys. unlike them you haven't made it through to a grand slam final. what do you think it is that has held you back compared to some of those other guys?
a mental or physical thing?
how tough has it been over the last couple of years, dropping back down the rankings a bit? did you ever have doubts you'd get back?
do you feel you're a better player now than you were two years ago because of that experience?
he had you in some pretty difficult situations in the first and second set at 42. what did you do right to bring yourself out of those situations?
the returning troubles were mainly because of his lefthanded serve?
possibly andy murray in the next round. how do you assess that matchup?
do you know him very well from playing him?
you played against him for years now. do you know him very well as a friend or just as an opponent?
but you beat him here, didn't you, three years ago?
that would give you confidence if you played him?
what went wrong at wimbledon this year?
you've been with your coach for a long time. what's the secret of the chemistry there?
what was the key for today?
you face federer now; he had a walkover. does it really bother you that he didn't have to play a match today? are you any worse for wear?
can you talk about your matchups with roger over the years and what you expect when you play him?
you had, i don't know, eight or nine matches. you beat him obviously in athens and then eight or nine times you lost to him, but it has gotten close lately. do you have a different approach now because of that when you play him? the last few matches have been a lot closer not closer, but at least you've won, as you say, three of the last six.
what's the difference with you since toronto and cincinnati where you didn't play too well and you seem to be playing a lot better here?
the top three players have won 30 out of the last 31 majors; del potro obviously won here. is it purely talent? is it purely physical? is there also a psychological component to it?
your parents are here. i see them walking around like tourists having a good time. is it enjoyable to have them here for a tournament like this?
they know your tennis since you were a small boy. did they ever give you any advice about the way you're playing or something?
tomorrow night could be andy roddick's last match; he's playing del potro. could you talk a little about what he meant for the game or means for the game.
does your shirt say nsw? does it stand for new south wales?
i think in the first set at 55 you might have been down a break. the building is half filled, and it absolutely erupts. as much sound as maybe a night match. talk about playing off the crowd today.
was this anything like the previous neardeath experience?
how is your shoulder?
when you woke up yesterday...
three hours of match, did you expect such a fight? if you had gone to the fifth set, were you tired or feeling confident?
a comment on fognini's performance.
can you talk about your own personal matchup with del potro?
is he a little bit of a mirror image of you?
were you pacing yourself in the third set?
not chasing balls that were clearly wide.
are you conscious of letting the crowd get in? are you doing it more than you ever have before? are you looser?
if you win the tournament, will you show up next year on the first day to defend?
when you were working with jimmy, he's a motivation guy, did he ever refer to his run in '91?
as a kid, do you remember watching his run?
did you really sneak into the locker room or just the players' lounge?
just a thought on jimmy when you were a little kid.
when they were showing the video, happy birthday video to jimmy, they showed some scenes from that. did they show anything that you were actually at that you remember?
was the experience of going through this might be the last fill in the blank any different this time than the first time?
do you feel you're playing more aggressive being in your last tournament?
how about coming to the net more?
when andre retired, he revealed there were times when he actually hated the game. did you have any stretches like that in your career?
the point he hit between his legs, can you describe it?
what is bigger, your own emotional reaction or other people's?
who is the most random person you've heard from?
you're used to looking up at ashe and seeing people cheering. you're on the set doing the postmatch interview with cbs interview, you turn around and see the plaza full, what was that like?
talk about these us open moments, connors in '91, andre's speech. what is it like to suddenly feel that developing around you?
what has surprised you the most in playing the last two matches that you didn't expect since you announcement?
was your moment at net with fabio a gutcheck moment?
one of yours?
did you give him the sweaty one you wore?
how do you prepare yourself mentally for your next match? you want to win, and at the same time it could possibly be your last match.
loosening the tension?
you said when you do play your last match, you're not the type of guy who won't return to the court because you obviously love the game that much. what's the most pure joy for you? is it the simplicity of striking a tennis ball?
is your betweenmatch and prematch preparation now with these matches any different than any other tournament in terms of what you and larry do, what your practices are like?
you said you weren't in the category or status of connors and agassi. when jimmy was around, there was mack and vitas. for a decade now, no offense to any of the other wonderful players, you've been the leader of our sport in the most important country arguably in the tennis world. isn't that a pretty unique and special achievement?
the hamburger helper, are you going to need surgery or rest when this is all said and done?
considering your talent and your tennis abilities, do you think you've been more lucky because you came at the end of the sampras and agassi era when it was easier to sneak inside and be no.1, or more unlucky because after there was federer who is probably the best of all times?
i wasn't comparing generations. there was a hole between sampras and agassi and federer. you snuck inside at that period.
'02.
2003.
just couldn't quite get back in it in the end.
talk about that game in the third set.
disappointed with the third round, but are you overall happy with the campaign here?
this year do you think australia can get back into the world group?
watch any of bernie's match the other night?
have you heard about it?
pat is obviously the captain, but are you the sort of guy who might get in bernie's ear?
what's it like to play ferrer, to try to solve him maybe versus what it was like in '06 and '08?
(question regarding bernard tomic.)
firstly, take off thursday or a bit earlier?
what are you plans for the rest of the year after davis cup?
is this tournament an opportunity for people to know the name david ferrer? seems like you're not the bestknown player of your own country and there the three and number four is david ferrer. is this an opportunity to get to a different level?
what was the difference for you in today's match?
he had five set points in the tiebreaker. you played great points on all of them. is that something you enjoy?
i was curious if like tomorrow will you take a little time out to watch mardy fish against federer for scouting purposes or being a tennis fan?
benneteau just said that your baseline game was quite outstanding and you can't miss a shot. it's true you can't miss a shot since three rounds now. do you feel like this on the court, that it's one of these moments where you are totally.
you're a bit of a premier player and probably more used to playing at night. how do you get ready for an 11:00 a.m. match? looked like you didn't have a chance to shave today.
you're winning so easily. it's almost like you're going quietly through the draw, if i can say that. andy is making headlines and there is always roger. you're just going out there winning in straight sets and getting off the court. does it seem like almost strangely enough you're under the radar so far?
what are your comments about dolgopolov, a guy that comes from the country that doesn't have too much history in tennis?
you have such a great return of serve. many say it's the best around. could you sort of break it down? what's the key to the return? how have you been able to be so good?
who is the toughest for you to return against? there are a lot of big servers out there.
do you have to guess?
we live in a small world. you had some really nice things to say about andy last press conference. there was that situation a few years ago back and forth. how did you come to resolve that with andy? i assume you worked something out.
when you came into the sport, did you expect to be on such good terms with your closest rivals? i mean, the top 4, you always seem to get on pretty well. you work together well. it must be very difficult because you're real competitors, aren't you?
how hot was it out there?
were you affected out there by the heat? were you cramping?
you had two medical timeouts. they were working on your forearm, was it?
do you feel any added pressure with roddick retiring? a lot of people pointing to you as the next american hope maybe under the isner group a little bit. does that put any pressure on you?
you're getting right to the cusp of the top 200 i think with this run here, but you still managed to play really tight with a guy just outside of the top 10 for three sets at least. do you feel you're closer to those guys now than you ever have been?
what do you need to do to get even closer?
can you just talk a little bit about the experience this year here, you know, playing some pretty good tennis, packing the stands everywhere you went, getting lots of reactions from the fans. your feelings about all that stuff.
did you talk about the injuries already?
so the game at 4all in the third set, you're up love40; i think it was a pretty crucial turning point.
you're playing doubles here with a guy who played four years of college tennis. you obviously turned pro without going to college. can you talk about sort of why that was the right route for you in sort of comparing the two options for people who might be weighing on the other?
rising in the rankings on the atp is tricky business. can you just talk about your process, your career? you had a match with andy last year, if i recall correctly, the mixed win. it was a good tournament here for you. do you feel you're trending in the right direction? do you see some problems? what are your thoughts about your process?
in vegas, were you training with reyes?
what's it like to train with that guy?
you sound disappointed. are you?
the last set aside, you were right there with almagro. he's one of the top players. what's separating you right now from just a player of that caliber?
you talked about the energy out there. can you quantify that sort of home field advantage with that many people and trying to pull you past that guy?
does it lift your game? are you playing above yourself in that setting today at times?
when you think of tennis in america, hot beds of tennis, maybe florida or california, talk a little bit about nebraska, which i guess claim andy and yourself. what's tennis like in nebraska?
how do you rate your serving today? couldn't be too shabby.
how do you get out of it when you're tight?
going into the fourth round with a big energy advantage over murray. do you feel, given the conditions, that you're going to be the fitter guy?
how much do you take out of the win you had over him earlier in the year?
that's a pretty small court. did you feel it? what did it feel like to play on it?
you've set some high standards for yourself. i wonder if there's any sense of frustration that you haven't made more of a breakthrough at one of the bigger tournaments?
you don't feel like you don't belong where you are, even if these are new experiences?
will this be the biggest match of your life, playing against andy on ashe?
quite strange the two of you also have a walkover, two matches which haven't taken place.
do you feel like you're ready to post a win over a top player on a stage like this?
do you feel when you're clicking, when your serve is going, that you pretty much control your destiny against any player?
what have you learned about your second trip to this tournament? anything?
how difficult is it playing against andy, one of the best returners in the game, despite your big serve? how do you have to change your game against andy?
how do you feel about the progression through your three matches here?
you're talking about your serve, but the rest of your game was pretty good. did that come out because you felt so confident on the serve?
who are your heroes in the sport?
were you ever a racquet smasher?
when did you make the concerted effort to stop that? how long ago?
what do you think made the difference in that fourth set? you were close to kind of breaking it all the way back open. what happened?
are you still working with brad?
what are your goals for the rest of the year?
i noticed you were changing your socks quite often. is that to prevent blisters?
that was pretty tough and hot and a difficult match, wasn't it?
how deep did you have to dig to come through?
how does that compare with australia when it really heats up? is it tougher?
here?
on reflection, how big was the breakpoint, the rally that was one of the most extraordinary of the tournament?
you've dealt with him relatively easily in all your six matches before. what did he do today that made it more difficult?
did you worry not being able to go to miami would have this effect?
you're not worried that playing so much today will have a knockon effect?
you tell us sometimes what you eat before a match. after a match as physically draining as that, what type of food do you put in yourself?
meat, fish?
what will be on the menu tonight? big steak?
it looks like you're going to play raonic, who you played three times this year. can you talk about the challenges he presents.
do you see him as someone that is really going to be a contender for majors?
how do you see nadal's injury, his future?
you're having a great summer. if you had to step back and say what the one or two toughest things you've had to go through in your career, what would those be?
yes.
going away as a kid, was that tough?
did you get to watch laura yesterday?
how impressive is it to put massive wins like that back to back?
have you run into roddick at all?
how do you deal with that situation? do you leave him alone? do you say something if you see him?
it's obviously such a big achievement for anybody to win one major. do you ever look at roger's 17 and wonder how that kind of achievement is possible?
when we spoke to feliciano, he said any other era you would be no.1 for a long time. given a choice, would you rather be in this era, which makes it tougher for you, or is there a part of you that wishes those guys didn't exist?
it looked at times like you were shaking your head at some of the serves. 29 aces. where does his serve rank up there in all the serves you've played against?
early in the match, fifth game of the first set, you had a couple breakpoints. he hit three monster serves. was that momentumchanging at all?
how were you in the third able to make a pretty good set out of that one?
you're giving him a lot of credit. you came out with a different attitude in the third set. was it purely based on his serve, or did you have a moment to yourself in between the sets to refocus?
andy's big announcement the other day, plans are to go on?
would you play quallies there if you needed to?
how good does he move for a guy his size?
if you could go back and play anybody who you never played from past eras, who would you play?
in some ways, do you think his legacy is beginning to not be remembered?
there were seven american men in the third round here, the most since like '96. some are still in; some exited today. do you feel this is sort of a swell of american tennis?
is your perception different about players that have children now and players that are single?
who offered advice?
what is your dr. spock most important tip for kids?
could you talk about the younger generation, ryan harrison, jack, steve johnson. of those, who has the upside, would you say?
so what's it feel like?
did you envisage this sort of success at the start of the week?
talk about your run at aptos. obviously you had tremendous success in the collegiate arena, but was that significant?
do you have any pressure to sort of fill a vacuum in your generation of good americans?
do you think it helps having a group from the same country sort of in friendly competition? i have seen it in spain and france. do you think that's beneficial to everybody?
not too many players i know anyway go from ncaa team champions, singles champion, et cetera, to the atp tour, like la, to a challenger and then here. can you just talk about the different venues, the different pressures you feel in those different sites?
as you get deeper into the tournament in the level of the opponents to rise, what do you have to do better on the court to keep winning?
next is gasquet, a former top 10 guy. any game plan?
any gimmicks or anything to sell yourself in the bigger surroundings, or do you just kind of take it in and then just play tennis?
do you feel that hunger out there for like a really good american? you had a lot of fans behind you.
some people might dismiss the aptos win as just a challenger, but murray, rafter, bob bryan all won there. how important is it to get a w to go through a tournament there and come out the winner?
i apologize, but when i mention the name pancho segura, what does that mean to you?
were you aware that you shared a collegiate record with him winning the ncaas three times?
what do you see as sort of the weak points of your game?
what has peter smith said to you earlier in the summer and through the summer? i know he came to see some of your matches in california, but what advice has he given you on the transition?
what is your residential situation? do you have an interesting roommate?
what was going on with the let calls and the chair umpire?
the machine was going off?
there were a couple times where it looked like it was six inches over the net.
after you lost the breaker you had a quick hold. you netted a return early in the third and looked really disheartened. what was your state of mind at that moment and what turned it around for you?
looking at your body language, it looked for a good part of that match that you were fighting yourself. more negative behavior than we might usually see.
do you feel sometimes actually maybe it pumps you up a little bit, the way you get emotional during your matches?
how confident does this victory make you feel about the next round? have you played kohlschreiber or paire before?
you're going to be asked this all tournament, but what are your thoughts on andy retiring?
he mentioned your name as one of the players that's going to be the torch bearer for american tennis. how does that make you feel?
can you talk a little bit about the injury and how that impacted your play.
does it seem like a million years ago or yesterday when you won here? you were on court 11. do you have to remind people that you were a champ here?
blake is a wild card and they put him on show courts.
do you feel like you were almost adopted there by the crowd today?
very little margin for error; he played tight himself. you needed to take that rare opportunity, i suppose.
can you put in words about the drama of the fifth, what that feels like to you.
we have the clijsters retirement and the roddick retirement. what goes through your mind when you hear about that?
happily married man, three kids, all that. what was it like with kim? what was your favorite memory?
what are your thoughts on her stepping away from the game?
any idea why off of hard courts at slams she never prevailed?
looking forward to playing ferrer? do you give yourself a chance of beating him? how is the body feeling?
how difficult is it with what roger has done this year at the age of 31?
could you talk a little bit about your fiveset record. today was your 49th, which is the most by a long way. it puts you second on the alltime list of fiveset matches played and you have a very good record. what is it with you and fiveset matches? are you pleased you have such a good record in the fifth set?
what about previous matches, does it give you confidence?
with ferrer, you say he's not going to serve aces; what do you have to do? you have to be really aggressive against him?
you played twice before, both at slams, grass and clay. how do you see him on hard court?
do you see yourself as a broadcaster when you hang the racquet up?
you've been around tony roche. what does he bring in terms of his tennis or a person?
was there ever a stage with injuries and surgeries where you thought it might not be possible to get back?
are you very pleased with the business of the day?
what happened in that point early in the third set where you lobbed it back to your opponent?
what are your thoughts on kim's retirement? you always seem to have a fun relationship with her.
if you could switch gears and go back to last year in the semis and the shot of your return of serve, could you just reflect on that? was there an element of luck? did you just go for it?
can you say that in a way it was an extension of this great season you had and that belief that it was there?
is that the single most important shot in your career?
you mentioned andy retiring. you obviously some way off from doing so hopefully. it's a reminder of how quickly a sports career can come and go. to just remind you, if you need any reminding, that you've got to seize the opportunity when you have it, which is obviously right now. and maybe, you know, you're having a great season, but it's so hard to emulate the season you had last year. does it just sort of show when you get an opportunity you've got to take it?
in terms of your motivation i know you have been asked variations on this before  but obviously you had such a legendary streak last year and achieved no.1 in the world. this year roger has been resurgent and returned to no.1 and you obviously are no.2. talk about just what you could take out of last year. can it sometimes be a burden in that you set such a high mark for yourself, or is it all positive? is it all that i've done it before and i can try to do it again?
do you feel reenergized when you're out there on arthur ashe where you have had the great success last year, particularly the last two matches?
you talk about the match, the conditions. with the heat being as high as it was, was it important to win quickly so you weren't out there any longer?
what was the dance about?
that was pretty straightforward for you, was it? did you feel in control from start to finish?
what did you change?
a lot of tennis players in nebraska, or are you about it?
you were in kansas from when?
in overland park?
you saved a lot of breakpoints in singles, crazy tiebreaker in doubles. what made you so successful on the big points?
pretty good run in atlanta leading up to l.a. emotionally, psychologically after that loss, where do you feel that left you?
was that a difficult decision to turn pro last year?
any surprises to the pro life so far?
what do you think holds you back now from being a top20 guy?
you signed a bunch of autographs today. do you remember when your first autograph signing was?
what do you take from andy roddick's career?
what does coming into new york do for you?
are you ready for the attention that's going to come now that andy is away from the game?
dumb question. does anybody ask you about doing a socks commercial, sock endorsement?
i think we can say when you go for an ace on a set point on a second serve, it's like a lot of players would do when you hit a forehand, you're that confident with that stroke?
in this particular case, what was the thought process where he was positioned, why you decided to hit it where you hit it?
not because there was a bigger opening?
federer said recently often before he tosses the ball he changes his mind about where to serve. is that something you do?
how do you compare today's performance to two days ago?
4all in the third set?
i wanted to know how you felt after this victory going to the next round? probably facing granollers?
do you have any comments on andy roddick's announcement of retiring?
did you see him?
are you going to play a retired tennis player in the fall?
how were the conditions out there, the heat, the crowd?
did he have any surprises for you, anything about his game you didn't expect?
your relationship with your serve, is it stranger than like a relationship with a forehand or backhand?
forehand and backhand, you're going to be on a little more. serve is more unpredictable.
he said before the match he wanted to play before the match he wanted to play on a bigger court because of your kick serve. was that in the strategy?
if by any chance you play blake, that would be more of a glamour match. would you like to play an ashe if it was like a night match?
did you ever practice on ashe?
did you learn anything in the match against hewitt about this crowd?
how important is style in tennis? we know how important professionalism and athleticism is.
as far as inspiration, is there anybody going back to maybe when you were a kid watching tennis, anybody's uniforms that were cool that stood out? was that part of the reason that made you want to play tennis?
sports like basketball, we've seen people like allen iverson, his personal style, turned the game upside down. ten years later you see all the other athletes following his lead. how much room do you think there is for tennis style to grow into the mainstream?
can you evaluate your match today, what it means for you going to the third round?
what has andy roddick meant to you in terms of following in his footsteps as the next generation of american tennis?
were you happy with the way you played today? there were a few times you looked like you wanted to throw your racquet.
two strong matches to open up your us open campaign. are you feeling good about the way you're playing here?
cilic is up right now on his match. if he would prevail he's your next opponent. he's obviously going to be a tough contest. talk about what you would expect from that match.
do you enjoy playing here?
did that experience, getting to the round of 16, does that make you hungry to go there and beyond this year?
if you could, describe the match.
and you did it against a no.5 player. i think it's your first defeat of a top10 player. advances you to the third round of a grand slam for the first time. is it fair to say this might be the best victory of your career?
did you feel you feel better than ever?
were you surprised in a way maybe sometimes tsonga was low?
was it helping maybe to see how frustrated he was at some points, smashing racquets or trying onehanded backhands?
did you have a game plan going into the match? how did you prepare?
is there any difference playing in a stadium like louis armstrong or any other court here for you?
could you talk about andy roddick retiring now? you're kind of the veteran american player now.
andy was saying that he didn't tell you before your match because you were playing. did you find out during the match?
you can look at it and say you've been in the same situation as him. why do you think you're motivated to still stay out here?
what was your initial reaction when you heard that andy was retiring?
what is fatherhood like?
you mentioned younger americans. what specifically about them do you like and see in their game?
could you assess today's match.
moving on to the fourth round, you were saying you feel this youthful exuberance. you'll be competing against somebody a decade younger. how are you preparing for this?
talk about the match.
janko tipsarevic came through after being down two sets. he said he hates the idea of being called a top10 player because you have this expectation that you're going to walk in and crush everybody. he felt that his energy level was down. do you have to worry at all in these early rounds that you're overconfident going into matches?
do you find it tougher winning winstonsalem, coming here, you have no preparation time, and the first match sneaks up on you?
there's no mental drain or anything on you?
petra won in new haven. she said in a way it almost didn't feel like a grand slam because she didn't have a lot time to come in and do a lot of prep stuff. was it a bit like that for you?
you said you don't like spending a lot of time on the grounds. are you watching college football preview shows all week?
you're going to lobby to not play next wednesday night so you can see the giants game?
as you climb in the rankings, meet a lot of expectations, is it difficult at all to sort of temper your expectations in an event like this to say, don't think about making the second week, just play this match? is that something you have to learn to deal with?
if you could go back in your imagination and play an imaginary match with some great legend, a great player of the past, who would you choose?
can you imagine responding to his lightningquick attack, return of serve?
considering your ranking, your form coming in, i'm sure you can understand why people think you could be primed for a deep run here. the way you look at things, round by round, is that you managing expectations to some extent, or is that more making sure you don't lose the details?
what are your thoughts on the continuing saga of brian baker?
the ncaa was talking possibly about shortening college matches, having a tiebreak in the final set, which might have helped you. what are your thoughts that they're backing off from that?
can you think of any tennis match, georgia, georgia tech, any match that approached your mahut match?
what goes through your mind when you watch sloane stephens play?
what makes her a special personality?
can you talk a little bit about the choice you took regarding college and then going to the pros? what has it given you that you went to college?
do you think it would be more common to go that way in the future?
i'm sure television executives are breathing a sigh of relief with your victory. has it gotten to a point where an american better start winning a grand slam or interest in the sport will decline?
james blake was talking about golf skyrocketing. and it's not just tiger woods.
with davis cup coming up, there are reports that rafa is still in pain. it's really tough to think about athletes and injuries. it obviously changes the whole chemistry of the match. can you talk about your thoughts about his injury and how it impacts the upcoming matchup.
did it feel good to get the first round under your belt and advance through fairly routinely and get comfortable on the surface here?
how important is it to win in straight sets early in a slam?
can you tell me what you did well.
do you have a goal for this open for yourself?
looked like benjamin had momentum when he had that first set point in that first set. what changed at that moment?
did you watch him beating agassi here on tv or...
was that emotional?
does it feel weird to play the same guy?
since agassi and sampras, americans have been looking for the one american that can take their spot at the top. people are saying you're the guy with potential. do you pay attention to any of the stuff being said?
does it help you have others like sock and johnson who is suddenly having a good tournament here?
del po has proven he can win this championship obviously. what are you going to have to do?
very tough match against a talented guy. did you feel it slipping away in the fourth and fifth?
you've said that you feel like the game owes you a few years because of all the time you've been out. how do you feel physically?
i remember when you were one of the young guys here. it's hard to believe this is your 15th us open. more than any other man in the draw, how many more of these do you see yourself playing?
you seem to be having some problems at the end of the fifth. can you explain what was going on.
obviously frustrating as far as the result goes, but can you talk about playing a fivesetter in that atmosphere, the crowd?
how much smarter do you think you are now as a player with your experience and how much does that count in this run you've had this year?
can you look ahead to the fall, what you're planning to play?
can you just give me a comment on how you feel you played today?
how was it for you to kind of shift your preparation from nalbandian to this player that you probably hadn't seen much of?
how long did it take you to figure him out? how many games?
he said there was a challenge in the third set that turned it around for him.
what were you doing last labor day weekend?
when you got back from europe you seemed to have a little tough time with the transition. was that expectation on hard courts before you could get back in the rhythm you were showing in europe?
talk a little bit about today, how the match went.
did you notice a lot of changes to the place since you were last here? did certain things strike you about being back?
did you come back and feel like you could fit right back in?
people are asking about where is men's tennis in the u.s. any of your thoughts on that or how you'd like to just be a part of that, or just leave that alone and do your own stuff?
how are you different as a player today from when you last set foot on the court here?
how much are you past the novelty of your story and making it back to where you are to where it's more routine?
where did you play your last match here, do you remember?
what are your thoughts on your next match?
what happened in that match more than 10 years ago?
can you talk a little bit about your physical preparation and also your recovery and just the precautions you're taking about your body and that process?
do you have a greater appreciation for the opportunity to play in grand slams as a 27 year old than you did, say, as a 20 year old?
beyond appreciation, expectations? what are your expectations?
if i have it right, you're not playing any league tennis this summer. how is the dad, uncle doing there?
you spoke about watching from afar the last several years. at what point did you think, well, i'm never going to be back, and at what point did you think, well, i will be back?
what do you think it says about you that you never did wave the white flag given all that you went through?
your dad was talking about the first time you came to this you were eight years old.
do you remember much about that night?
how did you feel about the energy today when you were you're on court?
can you recall anything interesting about watching last year's open, anything interesting? did you follow it closely?
does it feel like a new normal in the respect that this is a grand slam you didn't have to qualify for, you didn't get a wildcard for? does it feel like a recalibration in terms of both your preparation and expectations entering something like this?
crossing the threshold of 30 a little less scary in tennis now than it was 10 or 20 years ago?
the age of the top 10 players  all the players  has gone up dramatically recently.
we have just been talking to rhyne williams, and he said he's basing his game on your game: big serve and big forehand. what do you think about him today?
what would you say the biggest differences are in the way you played today versus when you won the championship here?
what do you marvel at most about roger's return to no.1?
you talked about after you lost to roger in wimbledon 2009 how you felt that changed your public perception and what murray went through recently. do you feel like a loss can really change the way the public views you and also how you view yourself?
one of the things that people don't know so much about you is extraordinary grassroots working with your foundation. you obviously were inspired by lance a good while ago. now there has been that development. he's done so much good work. seven tour de frances and now this. could you just share with us what your thoughts are on that?
do you think that the drug testing in our sport is important to maintain, or should it be changed in any way?
well, either intensified or not have them knock on your door at 6:00 in the morning.
i'm asking you what your thoughts are.
you have talked before about your admiration towards serena and also for venus, but what are your thoughts this summer on what serena has been doing here dominating?
would you agree with what kim clijsters said earlier in the tournament? she said for her money, serena was the best ever?
on the court you talked about getting to the second week, you know, as a birthday gift. at this stage, is that a very acceptable result?
what are your thoughts on the future of men's tennis in america? who are some of the guys that have really kind of impressed you with young guys up and coming?
before you came in, milos raonic was in here, and he says the thing he admires most about federer is the fluidity in his game. when you watch roger, what is the thing you appreciate most?
you worked very hard, big serve and big forehand early on. then you worked hard to add things to your game. were you that kind of kid, meaning were you the kind of kid who was always adjusting, or did the game sort of force you into becoming a little bit different?
you have worked with a number of coaches in your career. when does the novelty and excitement sort of wear off, and when do you know when you're in a stable relationship and you know what to expect from that person, what they expect out of you?
how do you view your secondround matchup with bernard tomic?
do you view him as a serious talent from what you've seen?
there you were winning big tournaments on the atp tour when you were 16, and he has yet to win one and he's around 20. is that the evolution you're talking about, the evolution of the game?
could you talk a little bit about your coach, larry, and sort of what he brings and what his real strengths are and what you appreciate about him?
this time last year the players were very forthright in their opinions about what needed to be done within the game, and now we're hearing about possible strike threats for australia. what's your opinion on all this? how realistic is that?
to sort them out, there is not an easy, quick...
what was your take on the move that san jose is basically going under and going to rio. i believe it's one of the second oldest tournaments, or one you played in many times. your thoughts on that?
just personally were you sad to see it go because you played it for so long?
how would you describe james blake's contribution to the sport?
just another day at the office?
few little battles with yourself today?
you have had some tough losses, long losses at the slams this year, so it must have been good to get a fivesetter?
were you surprised there were stages in the match when he really returned your serve well? was he returning that well?
do you feel like you've played offensively enough today? was he kind of dictating a lot of the points where it was close to the baseline?
have you had to adjust your career expectations as players have started peaking later in their careers.
the end of the second set sort of is almost shocking to me. you were going along in the first, seemed to be in control of the second, and then, boom, you lost your serve. i think you made a sign that you were disappointed. it happened all very quickly. from a fairly onesided match it went to...
you have lost again some very close matches this summer where it looked like you had chances to win to isner and del potro, wawrinka. what is it you need to close out those matches?
so you pinpointed your return as the shot where that would make the biggest difference. how do you go about working on a shot like that?
what do you admire and respect most about roger federer as you consider his game all through his career and now that he's back to no.1?
he went off a little bit in the fourth and maybe gave you the opening, but are you aware you have that effect on guys with your serve? even though they're ahead, they still know you're there and if they slip at all they're in big trouble?
how fast are the courts playing?
in some ways is this your home continent grand slam, or do you just put that with toronto and montreal as the home country grand slam but when you come in here do you feel like it's north america, it's the us open, and this one is big to me?
does it seem like it was just two years ago you lost to carsten?
good test to start you off, sam?
how do you deal with somebody who hits the ball low like that?
what are your thoughts about the state of andy roddick's game and his career right now, maybe any misconceptions about him when people are asking him about retirement at this stage?
what does he mean to the guys who have followed in his footsteps, and how has he served in a mentor's role?
what have been your observations of the way serena williams has returned to a dominant state in the women's game?
do you think you and isner have taken over the mantle of u.s. tennis? you are the faces of u.s. tennis now?
do you think now to really be on the top of your game you have to be in your mid to late 20s?
what does james blake mean to the tour?
what have been your observations of the way roger federer has returned to no.1? when you think of the federer legacy, what impresses you the most?
how do you think he's been able to do it?
you've come back from injuries. nadal is facing the same task. i wonder about your reaction, what it's like in the locker room without him, him not being here.
you mentioned you went from 17 to 120. what do you have to do to get back to 17?
what are your thoughts about the next round?
you faced 18 break points and you won 16 of them. how did you do that?
yeah, there were 18 break points against you and you won 16.
he won 21 of his points at rushing net, and i know last year llodra was rushing all the time and gave you more problem than it did this year. you seem to be more comfortable dealing with someone who is pressuring you by coming to net.
you had a tough loss in winstonsalem. when you have a loss like that, does it take a long time to process it mentally, and is it important to have a good match like today to overcome that?
in essence we know that roger federer is great, rafa is great, novak is great. people talk about you like you could be with those guys at any time. when you look in the mirror, can you see what you're missing from being in that group and being able to win your first major?
do you feel in your heart that you're close?
if there was one thing that you could improve to make you the fourth out of four, what might it be?
let's just say hypothetically there was one thing that you could do. what would you do?
you won a fair number of points today going to net. is this part of your game? is it just a reaction to him going to net? i don't remember the exact number of points you won rushing the net, but you did win several, you know, quite a number. is that part of your game that is developing, or do you still regard yourself as more of a baseline player?
you came into the tournament and you were quoted as saying that you feel like your game is on the verge of going to the next level. is this an indication to yourself that that's the case?
you held it together very well for a couple points. seemed to come up with the big shots when you needed that. is that how you felt it?
what is it like playing here?
what about the americans' chances here going deep into the tournament?
he was up a break.
people talk a lot about the physicality of the game now in the last 10 years or so, certainly the way the game is played in the top 10. do you feel physically that you're able to compete at this level or do you still feel you're growing into that?
talking about gil reyes?
is he here with you?
does this question about american tennis haunt you? do you get it at small tournaments? big tournaments? cocktail parties? dinner conversations?
how competitive is it among your own group? is it more like supportive?
can you get any inspiration or learn anything from what milos raonic has done so far?
you didn't see that coming with him at all?
on a scale of 1 to 10, how good was your serve today, knowing what you can do on a good day?
does that mean that it's not that important who is across the net, roger or rafa excepted?
are the goals different this year? do you expect more out of yourself this tournament?
are you and melanie oudin going to play doubles?
there are four japanese players in the draw, which is a record. it seems like tennis is becoming more and more popular in japan. do you have any explanation?
do you think one day maybe japan could become one of the major countries in tennis?
do you feel responsible for all the kids who are talking to play tennis? do you think you have a big impact on them?
does it help to have a little bit of not a walk in the park in the first round to get your juices flowing more quickly in this tournament?
specifically what kind of shots did he have that gave you trouble?
rain delay affect you at all?
are you working with mark knowles here? you guys in a lot of ways are peers.
how does having him as like an active player change how he is as a coach?
you were talking about it being very humid out there tonight. i know you said in the past you thrive in the humidity and heat. how do you feel that gives you an advantage?
davydenko?
yes.
you must be very happy with your performance today.
andy was saying that conditions were tough out there; it was very humid.
you play andy murray now. you've never played him before. good chance for you to play on a big court and maybe cause an upset?
what makes him so difficult to play? i know you never played him before. what are his big strengths?
where do you feel you might be able to trouble him?
you beat rafa. is that the best win of your career?
your ranking has been falling this year. is there a particular reason for that?
do the other players see andy murray differently now that he's won the olympics or does it not compare to a grand slam?
there's likely to be quite an atmosphere in the match. are you looking forward to playing on that kind of a stage?
so who is travis mathew?
what does it feel like being back again here and back again winning?
you have had a lot of epic matches at night here in the record books, length and all that. what's the difference between day matches and night matches? what ratchets is up for you?
speaking of the night match with agassi, a cliffhanger, a great match, did you ever feel in a match like even though you lost it's a winning experience, just that you know you laid it all out there and you comported yourself well? can there be a winning in losing?
healthwise how are you feeling?
this is the healthiest you have been since...
as a kid you were struggling with braces and weren't exactly a junior phenom. you went on the tour and lost your guiding light and went on to great wins and losses. we never get it right in the terms of big picture and story. could you take a minute possibly and reflect on your own career and your take?
you said at one point actually losing your father incredibly was the best thing that ever happened to you.
are you to the point in your career where you're starting to get old jokes from your peers?
along those lines, do you have any theories on federer as a parent, fountain of youth thing going on here?
just wanted to ask you about the state of the industry. last year on wall street we heard 1%ers, they own 99% of the wealth. in this industry it seems like 1% of the people win 99% of the tournaments. is that good for the industry?
with the dominance of the top three or four guys the past couple years, how hard is it going to be for an american like you or isner to break through here and make a run and be one of the top three guys?
speaking about people with big serves, what impresses you most about serena's dominance right now, having gotten back to that stature?
there was stunning news about lance. in our sport, there has been incidents. do you think the situation of performance enhancements are under control in tennis? is there any problem? what are your thoughts on that topic?
your fifth title in cincinnati and your first as a 31 year old. how do you feel?
how good was the first set? you have a plane to catch or something?
you said before the final that winning would be quote/unquote helpful for new york. winning a dominant first set like that and eking out a tight second, was that an especially helpful win for you?
do you feel pretty much going into the us open that physically and in terms of the way you're playing that everything is in place now? nothing to focus on?
you didn't face a break point throughout the match, but you did find yourself one point away from going to a third set. is that an unusual' thing? does that occur to you? are you aware of that?
do you think that he was mentally fatigued in the first set, and have you ever experienced that kind of letdown in a championship match?
he said he might have been.
how much do you notice the body language of your opponent? novak is demonstrative. he does facial expressions; he'll fist pump. do you notice when he's not making intense faces and things like that and making noise?
the slovak and czech language are the only languages in the world which have a special language in tennis language when you beat somebody 60. do you know this expression?
you're married to a slovak lady.
they call it to give somebody a beautiful bird, a canary.
do you remember how many times you give somebody canary in a tournament like this?
no. that was the loudest crowd i heard this week. you probably hear some loud crowds. do you ever get goosebumps in the middle of that?
you had some amazing halfvolleys. do you practice that shot?
as far as keeping a level of play going into the open, is it a matter that you've got to keep this level, or will you relax a bit and build up again?
outside of the top 3 guys, is there anyone who you've seen over the last couple months of form who will be a surprise challenger or a dark horse at the us open? anyone particularly caught your eye in terms of their form?
with what happened with nadal against rosol, do you think the top guys are going to go into the first week with a heightened awareness?
at age three, do your daughters already realize you as a champion, or when do think they'll understand that?
one of the worst start of your career, i suppose.
you made a big mistake at 43 in the tiebreak. was it the pressure?
how do you manage to keep your mind focused when games are running away from you like that but then be able to pick it up in the second set the way you did?
zero for four in finals here. is there a reason perhaps you haven't been able to play your best when you get to the final here, or coincidence?
at what point today did you realize it was turning and you were playing better and more in form?
was fatigue a factor?
he wasn't broken all week in 47 games according to sharko, and only faced three break points which he extinguished today. talk about his serve.
jim courier said on tv that he thought you were mentally fatigued and he called some of your first serves, quote unquote, apathetic; would you agree with that?
how do you rate the chances of the serbian women's fed cup team against czechoslovakia?
no doubt obviously we know there is disappointment, but i'm thinking surely it wouldn't have dented your confidence going into the us open with the results you've had over the last few weeks.
is the plan now to just take a few days off the tennis court and not think about tennis and recharge?
do you think of mental and emotional as the same thing? we were talking about mentally were you fatigued and this kind of thing. but i notice you didn't fist pump until halfway through the second set. you weren't showing a lot of emotion.
does this match make anything more urgent for you for the us open, do you think?
do you consider yourself the favorite for new york?
in new york, away from the tennis where do you like to go and what do you liked to do?
what did you see?
so you have to commute every day from new jersey to flushing meadows?
no problem?
you've saved all the break points against juan martin today and have done a remarkable job all season long and last year. what goes through your head with respect to break points and trying save them?
juan martin has been talking about his wrist problem the last couple days. he said earlier on that he did consider retiring from the match, but because you're a close friends, because of the sponsors, the crowd, he elected to continue playing. when you see the us open as just around the corner, would you have taken such a risk?
you were in a similar position last year obviously in cincinnati. i thought it was interesting, because tough bind, right? what do you do if you're not in 100% shape, especially for the final? do you withdraw before the final and people get no match?
you had one of the best years in the history of tennis last year, and obviously pretty difficult to duplicate that this year. what are' the biggest differences between this year and last year?
how happy are you feeling at the moment with the way you're hitting the ball?
you've been coming here since i think 2005. what do you think about the changes that the tournament's made in recent years? the most obvious one is becoming combined. what about the new locker rooms, dining, that kind of thing?
it's been mentioned changing continents, surfaces, even hard courts having different speeds, lots of inconsistencies with respect to the balls that are used on the tour in different events.
which ones do you like the best and why?
we don't know the outcome yet of the match; it's in a firstset tiebreak. talk about the potential matchups tomorrow.
you've accomplished quite a bit in your career: three majors, davis cup championship, no.1. is roland garros the biggest goal of your career right now at this point?
you've played against del potro a lot obviously back in '09 when he was winning a slam and since then at the french more recently. how would you sort of compare his game now? seems like he may be a little bit faster now. does that seem fair to say?
did you feel anything different from his backhand today? he said his left wrist was hurting him.
you've held serve throughout the tournament. how much of that is stroke, just placing your serve well, you're hitting it with power, and how much of it is you being able to defend your serve?
talk a little bit about the development of your younger brothers and their tennis careers, please.
you talked about missing roland garros from your collection. you're also getting pretty close at this point to having every masters title. this is one of few that's an empty space on your shelf. is that something you think about going into a final?
that was some of the hardest hitting i have seen guys go at it in a long time, especially in the second set. do you prefer that kind of pace when you play someone like tomas?
do you think this was your best result of the year?
30 to 5 in aces in a threesetter. how were you reading his serve? really well? what was happening there with your returning?
this was a marquee match, and yet you guys were on the court with no shot spot. i know he had more of an issue with it than you did. how do you play a match if you know you can't go up to the challenge booth if it doesn't exist on this particular court?
you're often lumped together with a bunch of other guys in your generation: harrison, dimitrov, tomic. i think you're seven top 10 wins in your career, and the other guys have i think three combined. do you feel like you're separating yourself from the pack of some of those players?
are you able to talk a little bit about your coaching situation and what you're looking to extract from your current coaching situation?
you got most of your success earlier in the year: memphis, san jose, even indian wells. why do you think you have played your best earlier in the calendar year?
if you could change one thing about the us open to make it sort of your dream us open, what would that be?
what about your next match? can you look ahead to that?
canada had the wimbledon girls junior and boys junior champs as well as the girls double champ. do you have any communication, dialogue, with the younger players in canada?
so you're based in spain. when did that take place?
jeremy has had a lot of pretty good results last few weeks. he's been playing well. do you think that match was more about that or you struggling today?
just a day where you just kind of didn't have it in you for the day or just a few points here or there?
was the court a factor at all, the fact you hadn't played out there?
i think this is only your third hard court match of the summer since the olympics. are you satisfied with how much us open prep you have? are you going to try to do anything extra now?
do you go to newyork straightaway then to work?
you have been playing very well lately, especially today. what do you attribute this recent rise in form to?
andy said he felt like you were going for your shots today. was that part of your strategy to beat him?
are you targeting olympic medalists? jo last week, silver medal; andy, gold medal; next is del potro, bronze medal.
i saw your match against fognini in quallies, and near the end you two had some words. can you share what that was about?
what's your coaching situation? right now who are you traveling with and who is working with you?
do you work a lot with patrick?
seems like there is a lot of camaraderie between people of that academy, especially i think dimitrov was there watching you today.
how much of an advantage do you think it was for you to play two qualifying matches before you played your first round here as opposed to the rest of the field that's just getting here from other places?
you played two qualifying matches before your first round.
you played somebody in the main draw who didn't play any matches here.
what are your thoughts on your next round? playing del po, do you know he's injured his left wrist?
you will be facing a lot of slice backhand. you know that?
you mentioned in qualifying you got a chance to learn a little bit and made some adjustments to your game in terms of playing. how are you finding the speed of the courts here in cincinnati?
have you seen serena practicing at the academy at all? she's working a little bit with patrick.
any success?
can you talk about the match going into playing querrey today. you had trouble in the past with him. what was your mindset going into the match today?
what's the situation with the knee? how did it hold up?
i'm sure you heard that rafa nadal pulled out of the us open with knee problems. what was your reaction when you heard that?
how much of a disadvantage do you think it was for you and the other olympians playing somebody like sam or mardy who has been playing here in the states playing hard courts all summer long?
i guess confidence matters for you, too, coming off the olympics going into almost any match now.
i'm curious if you pay any attention to the speed gun, either your serves or your opponent? does it add anything, does it mean anything, or is it mostly for the fans?
do you think they're accurate, consistent? in other words, from here to the open to wimbledon, do you think it's pretty consistent stuff?
do you think the number can intimidate an opponent at any time, just seeing the number?
juan martin was in here earlier saying after he lost to roger, he just got a whirlwind of support from argentinian athletes, actors, and that helped him to win the bronze. you mentioned in your pretournament interview after your wimbledon loss to roger you really were endeared by a lot of the brits and the press and that that really helped you, the support you got. can you elaborate on how that's helped you out, the positive tone that you've been getting?
professional photographs take lots of pictures of you. what are your thoughts when you see some of those pictures? like them? dislike them? something else?
gold medal run, confidence, everything you were talking about, how much of it is about your game improving to the point where you were actually ready to win a match like that?
with the increasing physicality of the game, after the success of the olympics which were primarily a bestofthree event for the men, there has been some talk about possibly making grand slams bestofthree on the men's side someday. how would you feel about that change?
is it important at times to wear your heart on your sleeve as happened at the australian open, as happened at wimbledon last month? i'm not saying that it was a deliberate thing. it was spontaneous. but how important are those sort of emotions for you for the public to see?
a lot easier than roland garros, no?
i know the top 8 get byes, but what's your opinion of having a backtoback week of 1000s at this point in the year?
seppi said that he felt that your confidence grew there in the second set, especially after that break. can you talk about kind of what's going on from you from the first set to the second?
did you ask to play on night session?
you probably heard that rafa pulled out of the us open.
i'm just wondering what your thoughts are about that and his long term processes, if it seems like he has this chronic tendonitis.
a lot more players are starting to wear clothing from asian companies; you most recently made a switch. can you take us through how that was decided?
you played rafa four out of the last five grand slams. obviously great rivalry. going into the us open i realize there are a lot of other great players, but does it take away a little bit of the excitement for you knowing he's not going to be there, one of your great rivals?
as a top returner, i'm wondering, do you pay any attention to the speed gun?
i mean, do you believe it? how does it affect how you...
how significant do you think it is for sports in serbia that at this year's olympics you guys got a gold medal in women's taekwondo on top of the traditional sports you do well in, like water polo?
do you think that hope for more and maybe acknowledgement a little bit of disappoint is what divac meant when he said, serbia remains a sporting nation?
you talked about the crowded schedule, how physically demanding it is. after the olympics, which is as important and a pretty successful bestofthree tournament, there was talk about possibly making grand slams bestofthree as well some day for the men. you played a sixhour final in the australia. how would you feel about that happening some day?
you've got davydenko next. can you talk about how you match up with him?
three weeks in a row for you. i think you're the only guy in the top five to have played the olympics, canada, and here. do you consider that a physical risk at all?
but did you consider, before the olympics, taking one of the events off?
are you feeling okay?
could you talk a little bit about the fact that you have been playing a lot of hard court matches here and a lot of the rest of the field has been at the olympics. how much of an advantage it is for you having hard court matches under your belt versus guys just coming back from the olympics?
just assess your play. you said your goal this year was top 20; starting to knock on the door of that. couple good results and you're maybe there.
is that a function of matches or wins under the belt or confidence?
challengers earlier this year. what was it like going back playing at that level?
you played baker, didn't you?
have you ever beat the same guy twice in one day before?
andy murray next.
after the olympics there was a bestofthree tournament, some talk about possibly making slams bestofthree also for the men some day. how would you feel about that?
did you feel it like before you had your match at wimbledon this year?
couple years ago you had your family out in wimbledon with you for a while. you had great success in the tournament before and even into wimbledon you did pretty well. are you going to look at maybe doing something like that for the majors going forward?
how do you feel about this coachsharing arrangement with sloane?
it's more unusual to have a coach coaching a guy and a girl.
after the open in the fall will he travel with you or her or both?
how was it playing doubles with mark knowles? did you pick up some things to add to your game?
sloane was talking about wanting to find a mixed doubles partner. would you ever be into that now that you share a coach?
is that because john is not playing doubles in newyork?
ball strikingwise, can you talk about your confidence coming back? do you feel ball strikingwise right now you're playing as well as you have since you came back from injury?
can you elaborate a bit on your experience playing world team tennis?
how would you rate your performance today in this match? also, was this maybe a good, easy first round? were you expecting maybe something a little bit more?
how would you rate your summer skipping the olympics and staying stateside?
do you feel like your trajectory is where you want it to be heading into the us open?
can we get a health update?
is there anything that you're doing about that now that's different than you were recently?
until i mention it?
after the olympics, there was some momentum given to the idea of bestofthree big tournaments for the most part. there was momentum given to the idea of possibly making grand slams bestofthree on the men's side some day. how would you feel about that?
might you have thought differently at and earlier part of your career?
having good and bad days, is that physical or is it mental?
just trying to get past that?
the result on the scoreline against lopez is a really good scoreline.
is this the best match you have played this summer, would you say?
does it take time, experience, to be able to kind of evaluate yourself on how you play apart from the actual victory sometimes to say, you know what, i'm doing everything right?
does it always translate?
you've been in a little slump in the summer after a successful spring. are you expecting road bumps like that along the way for the first year or so? did it not get you down that much?
talk about what it means to have such a big following since returning to the atp world tour.
nice revenge from wimbledon. talk about that a little bit.
what's it been like for you being back in the states after the great spring in europe?
are you recognized in nashville?
get some of those doiknowhim kind of looks?
could you detail your first match back on the satellite circuit, where it was, and could you tell me a little bit about what that was like?
but the lifestyle, riding around in vans, getting dumpy hotels, how much different is it?
is it easy to enjoy the tennis part on that level when you're trying to struggle your way back up?
and on the futures, would you run into guys that you had known somewhere along the way or was it all strangers?
is it almost like suddenly you had been on the varsity and now you're on the jvs again and you're out of place?
if somebody would have tapped you on the shoulder last july, august and said, next year you'll be winning rounds in majors and masters 1000 events, what would have turned and said to them?
just going back to those results after wimbledon, how much of it do you think was having had all the attention in paris and again in london, getting into these other tournaments, and it was a bit of taking stock, a bit of a letdown, and that you had to recharge and get going again?
have you hired a coach or physio or anything?
is it easy for you to just play tennis and not worry about anything that hurts or might fall apart?
all of this hasn't turned you into a hypochondriac, i hope.
just going through a threematch slump, can you imagine what donald young would be going through with 17th losses?
chances there in the second with the set points. the second set was kind of upanddown.
how do you feel about your game overall during the match?
what is it like for you jumping back onto the regular grind of the tour after the olympics?
he kept you pretty deep for a lot of the match. was he doing anything different with his game?
he's going to hit a lot of dropshots, try to pull you forward.
is that an effective way to play on hard courts?
wondering what it is to play someone that plays with a herkyjerky style.
is it a matter of more time on the hard courts to get more into a regular tennis rhythm than the grass?
what is your game plan before you go to new york? are you going to play next week?
you were talking about lack of confidence on the big points. when did that start?
over the last month or...
what are the challenges of playing new york versus the other majors?
(question regarding ryan's brother.)
when you see him play, what are the similarities between your games?
the other american players, roddick, fish, isner, who do you bounce things off of for advice?
tomic is part of your generation. how far do you think you are from your top form?
are you frustrated at all with how slow the road has been?
last year you were talking about how you wanted to be in the top 20 the next year.
sure.
you were talking about the level of the top four guys. if some lay fan came up to you and said, hey, ryan, i've heard it's a great time in men's tennis, i'm going to watch some players in the us open, who would you tell them to look at?
does this one, now that it's over, feel any different than the other ones? how did it feel inside?
clearly very emotional. can you take consolation from the way you played?
what was it like, the roar when you came out on court for the first time? it was amazing.
after all that's happened this fortnight, how much closer do you feel to achieving your ultimate goal?
how do you feel the rain break and playing under the roof changed the dynamics of the match?
the game in the third set that went on for so long, the 19minute one with 10 or 11 deuces, could you speak about the fortitude it took to stay in that game and then the challenge of letting it go and moving on?
do you feel that your performance was affected by the fall that you had?
i appreciate it's difficult for you to assess someone else at the moment, but given that roger is back at no.1 in the world, still winning grand slams in record numbers when his greatest rivals are at the peak of their careers, do you think roger will ever be elevated in the discussion of perhaps the greatest athlete in history, alongside the pele's and ali's, or what more would he need to do?
you've been asked this many times. obviously this fortnight, especially the last couple days, have taken the excitement of all of britain to a new level. can you talk about that achievement and what it's like to be the driving force of that? do you ever wish you were just another spaniard?
as disappointing as this is for you, what's the best that you take out of this entire experience to follow up on what you just talked about?
a couple days ago you talked about your quest in relationship to that of lebron james to win an nba championship. he last night was tweeting, thanking you for the shout out, that he would see you in london at the olympics. i wonder if either you'd heard from him directly or what kind of ongoing inspiration you might have from that?
what did roger say to you on the court after your speech? you seemed to laugh there.
a lot of commentators were saying before this match that this was your best chance ever. do you feel like that was the case? what can you say to people who maybe think that chance is gone for you?
you mentioned the special atmosphere on court. do you have a message for the fans who camped out in the rain last night just to get grounds passes? that's devotion, isn't it?
the emotion you showed on the court at the end shows how desperate you were to get there in the end.
roger dropped the first set, struggled in the second, and he turned the match around. the roof may have been a factor. did you also pick up any changes in his approach, his tactics? can you talk more generally about roger as an opponent in terms of problem solving, dealing with what his opponent is doing.
how long will you take off now and when do you plan to start practicing?
a seventh. got to feel unbelievable. but how different does it feel because of the circumstances around here? very unusual today.
you have a good memories in wimbledon, seven titles. do you feel destiny in wimbledon?
can you rate this win among all your grand slams?
how hard was it to listen to the same questions done in different ways about will you win a grand slam again?
andy said you were one of the greatest athletes of all time, rating you alongside pele. do you consider yourself that way?
this title and no.1 didn't happen in two weeks. it's a process. is there a point you can pinpoint when the run up to this actually began?
you mentioned tiger woods a moment ago. he's obviously also trying to regain the major tournament magic which you had today again. he tweeted that we saw why you're the greatest. what are your thoughts on receiving that message from him?
what did he say to you specifically?
what concessions, if any, have you had to make to age in the last couple years? schedule? training?
did you change your tactics at all after the rain delay?
i imagine when you were 22 that you felt like a better tennis player than you were at 18. i'm curious, how you feel about that now? do you feel like you are a better tennis player now than you were than five years ago?
clearly very emotional for him. you must have felt for him.
yes.
i want to know about how this affects your confidence maybe moving forward? and also, what does this tell you about your game, where you're at, from being still one of the elite players on the planet?
i can't imagine you felt you had anything left to prove about your career at this point on this stage. i'm wondering, did you feel when you walked onto court, was there a statement you wanted to make, a point you wanted to make with your play?
what was the difference? was there a single thing you felt was the tipping point in the match?
what were your thoughts before the match about the roof being closed?
how would you describe what pete sampras' record and legacy mean to you?
his example, how he achieved it, how has that affected the way you've approached your career and your play at wimbledon?
can you talk about your two prospective opponents in the finals. andy's record in grand slam finals is consistent but not great. is that a source of hoe for you? and tsonga, presumably you have unfinished business with him at wimbledon after last year.
not in finals.
having just beaten the defending champion in a highcaliber match, do you have to build yourself up again for the final and guard against any complacency?
you said before that nobody told you if the court was in your favor or not with the roof. but do you hope the final will be played with the roof or not depending on your opponent?
how do you explain the fact that the first two sets, the serve was dominating the match, and then suddenly you start to play a lot of rallies which you were losing?
the crowd clearly wanted you to win today. who would you rather face in the final? if it is andy murray, do you think the crowd will be as supportive on sunday?
what is your biggest challenge going into this match, considering you've been here so many times before?
you spoke a moment ago about andy being the local hero. what have been your observations over the years on the weight of murray mania and the country's attention to this tournament and this player?
after the third set, did you feel any different pressure inside the way that things were going?
how much of that was pressure related?
as far as falling behind in the match at that point.
is that the best roger federer has played against you in recent years?
how do you explain the drop in the energy level given that you came back twice in the us open from sets down? you have to think you have a chance, no?
there's a lot of discussion about the conditions with the roof. i'm wondering if you felt that was favoring you or him. talk about that.
you were winning all the long rallies until you were 3all in the third set. you should be more confident in your game. what happened afterwards? you start losing some serves, but...
you're younger than he is; you're defending champ. he's got a great long history here. there is a lot of sentiment for roger. is it possible to block that all out or did you think about this at all?
you've been so consistently strong over the last year and a half. was there any particular reason why you didn't feel as sharp as you were on that second ball? did you feel good coming into today?
after the last match you used the term 'i have nothing to lose.' what exactly did you mean by that? now how do you feel about that?
things almost went perfectly for you last year at the grand slams. was it sort of inevitable this year that they wouldn't?
whatever happens in the other semifinal, do you think roger federer is favorite now for the final?
when a great champion doesn't win a big title for a couple of years people start to doubt his ability to do that. i'm wondering if you always felt like federer was always there and capable of winning?
if sunday federer will win, he will become no.1 in the world. i don't know if you will watch it or not, but do you think about that? you don't care? in a way you hope the other one wins so you remain no.1.
he's 30; he's into an eighth wimbledon final. pretty extraordinary. for you out there facing him, what are the qualities about roger federer that are so tough?
can you tell us what you are going to do now ahead of the olympics? are you going to watch the final?
when you hit that dropshot in the last stages of the match, did that bring back memories of the us open match when you hit that fantastic shot? did you think you had a hope of getting back in?
is it quite nice to know you're not done yet here this year and you'll come back in three weeks?
what would pierre say?
set and a break down obviously not a great situation. what were you thinking then?
how do you think you played generally at the end? do you feel you were getting better as the match went on?
you tied tim's record here with you four semifinals. i imagine that's a nice accomplishment, but one you also want to put in the rearview mirror.
how would you describe the attention on you, the weight on your shoulders as you go for something that the country has waited so many years for?
seems that the forehand at 64, just an incredible release of emotion from you. can you describe what it was like, that moment, for you.
when you talk about putting yourself in a bubble and not listening to other people, what is it within you that helps you do that?
do you think this is your best chance?
on a similar point, obviously jo is a tough opponent. is there a part of you that is pleased it's not rafa you have to face here?
when you reach the semifinals of a grand slam for the 10th time, is it in your own mind, i should be here, or is there a feeling of, i'm thrilled to get here?
will you be able to draw on anything from your previous three semifinals here?
the duke and duchess of york were here today. how special is it to have the support of the royal box?
you said the other day you're not thinking about what it would be like to lift the trophy. is it ever difficult not to let your mind wander to those types of thoughts?
what do you remember most from the earliest ages of your appreciation for wimbledon and for the importance of the championship to people in this country?
were you more satisfied today with your focus, mental disposition, than you were with previous matches, or do you feel you were in the same zone?
when you're in the middle of a match like that, can you hear helpful hints from the crowd like, stop doing dropshots and attack? do you ever think, they're right about that; i should stop these dropshots?
you just spoke about the importance of wimbledon to the country. could you explain what you mean, what you feel the importance of wimbledon is to great britain.
from the outside it seems like a grind and there's so much pressure. but do you look upon wimbledon that it is going to be a grind or is it fun for you? do you enjoy it?
how would you compare the situation with other things you've seen or experienced, other sports, other figures, in the rest of the world?
what did that do for you to see lebron james win this year? did you internalize that?
could you speak about djokovic and federer, whether you see an advantage for one or the other players.
after the second set tiebreaker it seemed to really change the complexion of the match and he seemed to grow stronger while your level came down. do you feel that's true?
you come back here again in a few weeks for the olympics. do you come back now with more confidence?
where are you going to go now? how will you practice for grass?
can you speak just a few words about the semifinal between djokovic and federer. it's the first time they play on grass. who do you think is better on this surface?
what were you thinking when you came off very late in the match when the rain came? were you in a positive mood?
was it strange to be in the same training room with andy?
from what we've seen, do you think andy murray is playing at a high enough level to win wimbledon, or do you think he has to step up in the semifinal?
will you be staying in the village with the spanish team for the olympics or will you stay in wimbledon?
it looked very routine again for you.
when you have such a good headtohead record against someone, does it help you going into the match?
your 27th matchup with novak but your first on grass. what are your thoughts ahead of that game? what in his game do you think you need to watch out for on grass?
what has struck you most that he's improved on to be so competitive with you and to take recent matches?
when you've had him on the edge in some matches, how would you describe his ability to come back even from being almost out?
what is the personal relationship like given a few years ago you made some forceful comments about him from davis cup?
you had some treatments in your previous round, but there didn't seem to be any recurrence of it today.
do you still require treatment between rounds?
athletes focus on one match at a time. we're now getting down to the business end, two matches to go. what would it feel like to win here?
you feel your game is trending in the right direction?
mikhail appealed to the royal box for some advice at one point. what advice might you have given to your opponent?
you go out there with a game plan knowing there are certain things you can go on grass which you can't do on other surfaces or things you can't do?
considering that novak won here last year but you've won here so many times, does one have a mental edge over the other on centre court?
you always seem so in control of your emotions, so collected. we're all human. what makes you angry, tennis or otherwise? what is your pet hate?
you're a machine then?
you mentioned the royal box. does that make it rather a special occasion having that there compared to other places?
will you happily sit there one day?
did you meet william and kate after the match and what they might have said to you?
did you have a problem with your eyes at the start of the match?
is it important for you to enjoy yourself? do you find it's important to smile and laugh sometimes on court?
what do you admire most about the play of roger federer on grass?
what are you feeling right now about that challenge ahead of you?
it's your 27th meeting with roger, but your first on grass, i believe.
does that change anything?
i know you're very much in the wimbledon moment, but to what extent is it different this year given you have the olympics coming up just three weeks later?
you dreamt of wimbledon your whole life. last year you won. you've come back to defend. talk about the difference between getting that first title and the effort to defend it this year.
do you feel you have more confidence this year than during your run last year?
has your grass court game changed since last year?
you held the world no.1 ranking for a year. does the fact that you could possibly lose the no.1 ranking give the semifinal an extra edge, or that's not a factor for you?
you're playing very well as the game went on, but it seemed at the start you were a little hesitant with your footwork. people said you had an eye condition. was that the case?
do you think you have a psychological hold over roger at the moment after some of the big wins you've had six out of the last seven?
how would you describe from your perspective what roger's place in history is?
how tough was that with the conditions and all the delays?
was the weather a factor in the pace that you played that third set?
even if ferrer is a clay court specialist, how much do you think...
how much do you think the grass helps his game, especially his first serve which is maybe not the best weapon?
the way you're serving at the moment, do you feel you could be in a better position against him knowing what he's going to be trying to do?
you talk about the momentum being lost when you had to stop last night and come back today. what were your thoughts on the fact that no matches were moved to centre court last night?
were you surprised when you found you were put on court1 originally? did that bother you?
yesterday there was a prospect of you potentially playing three games in four days. is that a disadvantage?
obviously not for novak, because he's going to be playing under the roof if he is on centre court irrespective of the rain. is that going to provide an advantage to a defending champion?
you've won a higher percentage of points on your second serve than anyone else in the tournament. is that something you've been particularly happy with, and how important can that be?
after all these thousands of hours of practice, breakthroughs, setbacks, what would it mean for you to lift the trophy on sunday?
it's not up to you to choose if you will play under the roof or not. it depends on god. but if you had to play ferrer, and he has certain characteristics  moving, the wind maybe bothers him or you more  where would you prefer to play, under the roof, outside, normal weather? do you have any sort of preference?
following up about the action under the roof, what do you consider the biggest differences and what do you like and dislike the most about playing indoors here under the roof?
in terms of what you like and dislike most, what would you say?
the match you played against ferrer at the french open, do you think that has any relevance or not?
where do you stand on the argument whether you're the biggest hope the host nation has? do you feel you should get preferential treatment in terms of scheduling?
you're a laid back person. how do you manage to keep up the tempo? how do you relax when those delays are taking place?
you must be delighted. you had quite a journey since you last appeared in a wimbledon quarterfinal. can you explain it to us?
i know you've had injuries and stuff...
djokovic next.
following up about facing novak, what specifically would you say are the parts of his game that are the biggest difficulties for you?
for you, what are the strengths in your game that might give him problems?
when was the last time you were on centre or no.1 court?
so in terms of going back, it would be nice to get back on the show courts? how is it different to other courts?
what was it that brought you back to tennis? i understand there was a period where you half turned your back on the sport.
having done so well here, does it change your mind about not wanting to play the olympics?
and the main reason for the decision was ranking points?
can you describe your thoughts on the german successes here?
is this the best you ever played here?
gasquet said your backhand was incredible.
how did you find the conditions? frustrating because of the weather? was the grass difficult to run on?
if you win, the conditions aren't so bad really, are they?
tough going overnight, rain delays. today you looked like you had started to have the upper hand in the second set, and then he hit a bunch of aces in the tiebreaker.
how difficult was it coming on and off the court?
given your fitness before the tournament, are you pretty pleased with the way you've played?
seemed to have quite a heated discussion with the umpire towards the end. what was that about?
a line call?
how would you describe what you were feeling when you took the medical timeout? was it muscle tightness?
you felt it a couple rounds earlier, the back?
what was the treatment?
many years on the circuit, obviously lots of chapters. stepping back, what would you like to achieve before you hang 'em up?
jo seems like a bit of a different player. he was talking about the joy of the game. i don't know whether you're close to him at all, but any thoughts about what you brings to the sport?
you spoke about your goals going forward with your career. looking backwards maybe six or eight weeks ago, what would your goals have been at this period?
there's been a lot of talk in the media about the roof and whether it's being used properly. how about in the locker room? are you discussing that?
with summer coming up, obviously you'll be playing a lot of tournaments in the u.s. a lot of points to defend, but also a lot of opportunity. a lot of people are going to be away.
will you play l.a.?
will it be hard to watch the olympics knowing you could have gone if you wanted to? will you be excited to watch?
talking about roofs, were you surprised that the usta came up with a huge plan spending millions of dollars to refurbish flushing meadows and it doesn't include a roof? was that a surprise to you?
no americans, south americans, australians in the semifinals.
could you take a moment and talk about tsonga's chances to go all the way?
how do you reflect on the match and your wimbledon experience as a whole?
and about wimbledon?
quite a lot of shots hit the line. i could see you getting frustrated.
one of the most frustrating points was when you had a breakpoint in the last game and you slipped.
what were your expectations on the eve of this tournament? what are your goals now that you're leaving this tournament?
main draw.
leaving here now, what do you see as your goals?
you left america to come over here as one player. you're going back as a completely different player. can you talk a bit about that. what have you proved to yourself?
does he have a surprising amount of firepower for a guy his size?
you were away from the game for so long, and the game keeps improving. are you surprised that you've been able to come back and your game has risen without the play? do you have an explanation?
string changes or anything helped you?
if you were taking sort of a real tough look at this, you could say, okay, this european trip has been absolutely fantastic. now the fun begins in a way. how do you sustain this breakthrough?
and that confidence becomes a real factor at crunch time?
have you been hitting with some of the u.s. juniors here during the week at all?
do you remember who they were?
you were in their position nine, ten years ago. do they ever ask you advice? if they did now, what would you tell them?
are you okay physically?
since your comeback, has there been any time you've though, oh, something's gone out or whatever? was that a difficult...
are you fully committed to life fulltime on the tour now? are you landing endorsements and sponsors?
do you feel like you passed the breakingin period?
looking ahead, you play a guy you know pretty well in roger federer. how would you describe your history against roger?
so if not talking about your dreams, what you have to do, can you talk a little bit about the past matches? what has been the difference?
and then in your history with roger, the past matches, what has been the difference, do you think? because you have had good matches with roger.
what do you think has been the difference?
i can understand that. it's the same for a lot of players. he's beaten a lot of guys a lot of times. what does that do when you have that experience against a player and you know that you've lost the previous matches but you have a chance to turn it around?
so do the past matches matter at all in your thinking?
all the guys who are 30 years of age or older who are still in this tournament, what does that say to you?
i notice that some of the guys who tend to do well here, including your second straight quarterfinal for you and roger, have onehanded backhands. can you talk a little bit about tactically why that seems to work well and how that worked in today's match and just in general on grass?
can you describe why you called for a trainer, what was going wrong at that point.
how is it feeling right now?
did it happen on court?
xavier really enjoys playing you. do you find sometimes you bring out the best in your opponents?
youzhny next. why do you think so many 30yearolds are doing well now?
what is your feeling when nadal leaves tournament quite early? is it a joy or a pity?
can you describe your thoughts on facing youzhny, what particular challenges there are against him.
you were talking about this generation. you're the leader of this generation. can you talk about the two or three most important matches in your career?
was the sampras win also a key?
how surprised were you that they didn't shut the roof today? do you think that had any effect on your back injury, it was bit cold?
you must feel gutted?
how do you think you'll look back on this match?
were you surprised how much energy you had near the end? you had some of the best rallies in the end of the match, late in the fifth set when you were fighting over that final break?
i think it was the secondlongest match ever at wimbledon. any thoughts about going after john's record?
during the match were you thinking about that?
and two more days.
what do you think the key is, though? it's one little thing here or there, blink here or there. is there anything else from the match that you sense in a match like that that makes a difference?
what are the one or two things that brad brings to the game for you?
and you spoke about life in dallas in paris. how are things going?
andy, after his match, which he lost, wouldn't answer really the question of whether he'll be back here. what can you say he means to you personally and to american tennis?
the two guys moving on in the tournament, first brian baker, how would you describe your perspective on his story to be this far at this tournament?
given the scare with mardy just a short time ago, what are your thoughts on where he is right now?
you have had your issues, too, for sure, things to come back from. are you feeling impatient for it to really break for you in a slam the way you'd like it to, or are you feeling relatively decent about the process and how it's going to go for you?
do you have anything before la, or is that next up?
fish and baker together, their two stories, having their odds, how would you describe just the notion that both of them are in the round of 16 here?
considering just the circumstances of the match and coming back from two sets down and the length of the match, does that feel like a corner turner for you?
have you had another match which compares to this one?
i guess the thing is three or four years ago a match like you had tonight would have been the story of the tournament. the way things are now...
sort of strange in a way. i mean, it's a mega match.
what do you think is going to be the buzz factor?
5553, something like that?
rafa obviously suffered his huge loss the other day and federer had a big scare. does that have any impact at all in the locker room at all? is there any reflection on it, any ripple, because the guys have been so dominant?
when you're sort of getting deep in the fifth set and it's sort of uncharted territory for you, do you ever think of your fitness or how your shots are going to hold up or any questions? are you kind of amazing yourself by how well you're able to keep going?
given that you four guys each won two matches and two of you guys have won a third, what do you think it says about the state of affairs now for the men and for america?
there was a golden set today. did you hear about that?
shvedova against errani had a golden set. first set was 6love.
you had a couple of those?
what high school?
against a french open finalist.
never heard or no urban legends of any golden sets that you've heard of?
which do you think is a bigger stunner, rosol versus nadal or this one?
how does it feel to play somebody who had such a huge match only two days earlier?
can professional players understand how rosol can come out here and beat somebody like nadal? did you have any anticipation you'd be playing him today rather than nadal?
you've beaten nadal recently, as well. did you speak to lukas at all about your experience?
your next opponent is brian baker. what do you know about him?
he said that he thinks he might have played doubles against you about eight years ago. do you have any recollection at all of ever seeing him on the court?
so you know a little bit about his story?
what do you make of it?
you mentioned in an earlier round that you expected lukas would be in good shape mentally and physically. the wind seemed to bother him. his body language wasn't that confident. did you notice that and take some strength from that?
you played such a focused match. at the end he's taking the crowd's applause and signing autographs, and i watched you climb over the fence and disappear. have you left as a winner ever unnoticed like that before?
when you think back to maybe when you were at this stage of moving up the rankings that lukas is now, did you have a breakthrough win like the nadal win? what are the challenges for a player at that level to sustain that while they're still maybe not able to afford the coaching, travel, physio, things like that?
what was it like for you two nights ago to watch his match against nadal?
this is your first time in the round of 16 at wimbledon. what are your emotions on reaching that for the first time?
tricky player? what are your thoughts on the match and just your thoughts about your wimbledon so far?
a lot of guys thought you might have been a little bit fried today with the length of your match the other day and the stuff you have been going through. you have got to be pretty pleased with yourself. can you describe the process?
where is the needle on your fuel tank?
the other day you spoke a bit about your impressions of andy roddick coming back here every year after the heartbreaks that he's been through here. what are your thoughts, now that he's out of tournament, about what his legacy is here at wimbledon?
beyond just wimbledon, what does he mean to american tennis?
would it surprise you if he wasn't back here next year?
it would?
you seem really relaxed, almost laid back but pretty incredible achievement, considering. could you just talk about your feelings?
obviously yours is a great story. there is another one in the round of 16 in brian baker. how would you describe his story and him making it there?
before you saw the draw, i mean, coming into this tournament, you know, second week, is that something you were even thinking about or would you have been happy with a couple of match wins?
how does it feel to be out of sight, out of mind?
i remember you saying you were watching roland garros, and one of the commentators said something to the effect that john was the highestranked person. even though you weren't out of sight, out of mind for more than a couple months...
what do you expect in your next match against jo?
i guess you'll have to return extremely well in that match? all of it could go to breakers?
do you think you are very happy to have day off tomorrow?
what are you going to do tomorrow?
will you watch soccer?
you have been coming to europe for years to get into it a little bit?
can you assess your performance for us, how you thought the game went for you, having to come from a set down.
was there a point in the match in which you started feeling comfortable with your own game?
andy roddick is keeping everybody guessing about his future, whether he should retire or not. do you think he still has a lot to give to this tournament? do you think he could still win wimbledon?
you'd like to still see him on the men's tour?
how do you see the del potro game going?
did you think it was going to go on until monday?
did you think at one point it might go on as long as mahut and isner?
is that the longest match of your career? how are you feeling physically now?
when you came off, did you manage to watch any of the murray match?
do you think it would be good for you if it does go through to monday and gives you an extra day to recover and also makes it more difficult for them?
was there anything you kept saying to yourself as the match got going farther and farther?
if this match does go to monday  we'll see  would you watch it or go along or send bob along to scout it or how would you do it?
what do you plan to do tomorrow on your day off?
what sort of food do you eat on this occasion where you have to build up for a big match?
what sort of carbs?
when it comes to andy and wimbledon, there is obviously the crowd getting behind him and really trying to give him a lift. that's going to be a bit different from a davis cup match here. how confident are you to deal with that kind of environment?
do you think you have a chance to beat him? obviously you did well at queen's, you are playing well this week and getting into your form, as well.
got to be pretty happy, but also pretty tough to play a guy who is so unbelievably up and down and kind of whacky?
with all you've been through, does it make it easier for you to deal with distractions like wind?
is it difficult playing someone so temperamental?
when you look at guys on the tour in general  and not necessarily just talking about them that do get moods and upsets about little things do you, because of your experiences, have a different view of how they are?
you've come from playing challengers to the now the second week of a major. are you still having any 'pinch me' moments?
what have you heard from other americans, all playing today?
there is the chance the four of you will be in the next round. can you give your thoughts on the four of you as a group and maybe your observations of each one's unusual story to be at this stage?
what you have in common and what is different about each of you?
in terms of your individual games and your personalities.
you were in the hunt for a wild card here; ended up playing in the qualifiers. in retrospect, was that a good thing?
seven years since you've been on a grass court before queen's?
at what point did you actually say to yourself that you could play secondweek grand slamlevel tennis?
i saw a tweet of yours that your family had to change your travel plans.
how long are they here for?
if this would be the best achievement of the comeback and the best moment of the comeback so far, what would have been the worst moment?
in general, of all you went through.
did you have an idea of what else you would do?
you have to look out for your own prize money now.
what are your thoughts on playing kohlschreiber?
can you tell us a little bit about the first tournament when you came back, the futures event in pittsburgh.
is it right you actually turned up and said you wanted to play it?
if you would have been told then that you would be in the world's top hundred by then, what would you have said?
novak said there's 128 players in the draw and everybody is hungry. is that how you feel? how do you feel about it?
do you remember a time when you were off watching a wimbledon final thinking it would be really nice if you could get out there and play on that centre court one day?
did you think maybe when you took the first set that there might be another czech shock on the cards?
what did you make of lukas rosol's performance last night?
do you think he can go further in the tournament? do you think he will continue to play like that?
what have you seen from him in the past that would have ever made you expect something like this?
did you talk to him after? have you spoken to him?
did he text you back?
that might be your biggest win in what a year? certainly at a slam?
you were pretty psyched after the match.
it wasn't easy coming back, clearly. this time last year you were having the elbow surgery and you started climbing back in the fall. it's taken a while. can you talk a little bit about the process to get the level back?
what were your thoughts as you saw the nadal match unfold last night?
how would you describe the effect on your half of the draw?
five times.
how does it affect your thinking?
you talk about coming back from an injury, the physical part, but is there a mental part where you sort of worry something will go out again or something will hurt or you'll twist it?
you must be pretty pleased with the way you returned. big serves, but then you got a return on his game, too. you returned serve pretty well today.
have you become a better competitor since the injury?
do you think you're a better competitor now than you were before the injury?
what has changed for you in the past month that you said you started to notice you're becoming competitive again?
what do you expect of yourself? do you expect top 20? i mean, you were getting to top 20, probably anticipating top 10. i mean, did the injury take your goals and throw them down the trash, or did you have to reassess?
can you speak a bit about your next opponent and what special challenge that poses for you?
most people who criticized you in the past at any time tended to say you lacked intensity, didn't seem to want it as much as other guys have. has that changed? and if so, why? was it fair or wasn't it fair?
does a win like today help confirm that you are getting back to where you were?
of all the upsets you're familiar with in tennis and other sports, how would you rate what happened last night with nadal?
how much do you know about rosol? what kind of player is he now that everybody seems to want to know who he is?
we're seeing so few guys breaking through now 17, 18, 19. why do you think that is? is it just physical?
can you talk about a little bit about working with brad?
what are some of the things he's been telling you?
do you think they should close the roof because it's getting dark or just close it because it's going to rain? it changes the conditions. you have an indoor tournament, indoor match at that point. should you wait and play the next day if it's not compelling that you have to finish the match?
how much fun has it been for you to see brian baker, the whole thing?
the other day mardy was talking about how if he had undergone what andy did here, the heartbreak of the defeat against federer a couple of years ago in the final, it would have been tough to come back. what do you make of andy staying power in his returns to wimbledon?
if you excuse me, i was hoping to talk about rafa a little bit. you're very good friends with rafa. were you surprised to see him exiting the competition last night? was it a shock?
is it just a case of a guy having a great match and just he was inspired?
obviously andy murray, it opens up his half of the draw, but there are other players...
do you think it is basically, you know, he gets to the semifinals and then he can start worrying about that? that's when he would have been drawn to meet rafa, anyway. i know you know andy very well.
along the similar lines, you just played rosol in france. could you have seen this coming from him?
you just played rosol at the french open, right?
could you have seen this kind of performance coming from him that he delivered last night?
you have experience playing with him.
you know his game and his style.
could you have foreseen...
it looked like it meant so much to you when you won. can you tell us what it felt like to win it here?
like you said, you keep working hard and keep hoping things turn around. it must be more worthwhile when it does turn around.
how did you feel when you finished that match today?
if you had the opportunity to watch it last night, what were your thoughts as the nadal match unfolded under the same conditions under the roof at least for the fifth set?
the nadal match yesterday. what were your thoughts as that match unfolded?
yes, yes.
what do you think you brought tonight to bring the victory? what do you think the keys in that marathon were for you to emerge on top?
what are the biggest differences between playing on grass indoors as opposed to outdoors?
you said you played better in the third, but still in the fourth you were five times two points from defeat, if i'm not wrong.
so were you worried how much, and so on? and then do you know that today you've beaten also a new record, which is you have won 5,459 games in the history in a slam, and you're beating agassi who is behind 5,438.
29 games today, that's why.
in the beginning it didn't seem like you were yourself, you know, just not playing that well. then you got better, you know, the third set. did you feel like that, too?
when you were at the net with benneteau, what did he say to you?
yes.
as you can see, you are breaking records every day. so when you went there, which is the toughest opponent: the one that's at the other side of the record book, the history books?
you spoke of how the absence of the elements with the closed roof sort of allowed rosol to get in that trancelike state last night. did you feel like that in the fifth set?
can you explain what you were feeling two sets down and how worried you were at that point?
a lot of us have not seen a guy play the way rosol played last night, especially in a pressure situation. how much sympathy did you feel for rafa going down that way?
any thoughts on kohlschreiber against him tomorrow?
we know you have an incredible memory for matches. how much do you remember of the one match you played against malisse on grass? how do you assess his game on this surface?
2001, five sets.
so within this 24 hours or so rafa loses and novak lost a set and you have this incredible match. you could say in a way, oh, my god, the top 3 players...
yeah, right. (laughter.) but you really could look at it a different way. it shows that the level of incredible dominance that you guys have had, the ability to pull off whatever it is, 28 of the last 29. can you just talk about the dominance of the three of you and how really difficult that has been and what an achievement?
after what happened last night with rafa, any point where you thought, oh, no?
did you see rafa's match last night? what was your reaction to it?
did you watch any of it?
if you were in rafa's shoes and the roof was closed  he complained about this  how do you feel about the policy that it takes 35, 40 minutes to get squared away again?
were you surprised the roof was on today? do you like playing under the roof?
obviously you and rafa have dominated the story of the last four grand slams. was there a part of you at all that was genuinely shocked by what happened last night and knowing that this grand slam could be about to unfold very differently and you can never take dominance for granted?
with rafa gone, what do you see the impact on the tournament in terms of opening up?
the draw on that side is wide open. what must a guy like andy be thinking when he's watching that unfold in front of him?
do you think andy has a better chance now? that's what most people think.
what are you going to do for the next couple of days to chill out and relax?
closing the roof, it seems like it gave an advantage for rosol. nadal thought he played unbelievable. do you think closing the roof favored his style of game and that's what made it difficult for nadal's game?
how big is the difference about the grass first week and second week? do you use the same shoes or do you change?
what were the physical issues you were dealing with in the fifth set and what kind of effect did they have?
did you hurt your wrist when you fell in the third set?
feeling?
about five or six times you were two points away from winning. did you let it get away from you, or did federer play well on those points?
how did you feel about playing under the roof and how that affected things?
you like the indoor...
tough luck. you just said roger's the best player of all time. roger federer is roger federer, but can you try and put into words what he showed us tonight, why he was so tough?
so it's an incredible pressure?
were you surprised how well you were controlling the rallies? especially earlier on it seemed you were the greatest player in the world, not roger, the way you were dominating a lot of rallies.
was it one of the best performances you've played?
what does it take for you to compete at this level consistently on a day in, day out, for the rest of the season to this high level you've shown this evening?
you've just come off the court. it's hard, but years from now when you're telling your son about the match on centre court at wimbledon in 2012, what would you say to him?
did you watch the match last night? did your mind go back...
but during the match, you had ideas it could be...
how do you feel? so close.
you gave him the runaround.
was it the aces that made the difference?
with him having not played much in a while, did you think the longer it went, the greater your chances there would be?
you were playing really well. in the eighth game of that fifth set, you seemed to lose your timing a little bit there.
were you feeling pressure at that stage?
been in an atmosphere like that before?
when you compare your performance today against mardy fish in 2010, where has the improvement come from?
was that your first fiveset match?
in grand slams?
because the ball came off your frame a couple times tight at the end. was that a tired thing?
so your efforts have been recognized by arsenal. you must be quite pleased.
(no microphone. )
what was the number on the shirt?
looking to the future, what do you take from today, the manner of your performance, the grit, and shots you showed? if you had any doubts at all that you didn't belong at this level, have those been dispelled?
arsenal offered you a box for a game next season?
maybe they'll give you one after today.
you're off to newport next?
what's your emotion after coming so close to that?
there's a lot of people around here who were pleased with what you've done, not just you but heather as well. should we start writing about a mini revival?
(no microphone.)
were you surprised at the level he played?
yes.
your next station after wimbledon will be umag. do you have any thoughts about that? because you have in umag perfect record.
do you have any superstitions that you have, like on the court or on the day that you're playing?
how special is for you to be playing at wimbledon? it seems that the game also is favoring more mature players. so can you tell me how special? because wimbledon is a special tournament. you're playing well and seems that you know what you do out there.
players have been saying and malisse just said he felt the courts are slower. you have been here i think it's your 10th. i don't know.
but do you feel the difference? is it slower, do you feel? do you feel any difference? there are more rallies, it seems.
what has this week been like for you since your comments about your feelings and as an atp tour new player rep, what have you gotten from your fellow players about the comments on equal pay?
you say you would clarify it. is there something that's been misinterpreted?
does it undermine your point given the fact you lost straight sets today?
with respect, sam stosur said that some men's games can be boring. maria sharapova just said in this room that actually far more people watch her games than watch you play.
so how would you respond to those two?
just to pick up on the straight sets defeat today, do you think it would be a fair thing for you to forfeit maybe 20% of your match fee because you only played maybe threequarters of your match?
do you feel you delivered entertainment today?
can you talk about why you brought it up? how did it come up?
you are familiar with the long struggle for equal rights, that for a long time women had no vote, and that even now there are many jobs, the same job, where the man will get more money than the women. are you saying that all people want unequal prize money? are you aware of the importance of the struggle to many, many people?
you are one of the best players in the world. you have been working so hard to get back after injuries. malisse, he was a semifinalist here. how disappointing was it for you to lose when you had the break in the third set?
do you think there are quite a few male players on the tour who believe the same as you?
for example, roger federer was asked about this...
setting that aside, again, are you a little bit disappointed that roger federer, or whoever, your fellow male competitors, haven't said the same if that's their opinion? why should it only be you?
what kind of disparity should there be? if it's not equal, where should we be in terms of prize money for men and women?
you said it's not about the length of the match but about the entertainment.
can the women's game ever rival the men's game in that aspect, or are you saying they can never be as entertaining as the men?
how would you describe what you did tonight.
what were you feeling in the fifth set when it seemed you couldn't miss?
you lost five times here in first round. suddenly we see you play so well. forehand was outstanding.
no fear also.
did you feel when they decided to put the roof on that worked to your benefit? rafa didn't seem happy.
where does this moment rank in your career?
what were your expectations before this match?
in the second set he bumped into you on a changeover. do you feel he did that on purpose?
why do you think he was upset?
when you first came to england, if someone came up to you and said that you would beat rafael nadal in five, what would you say?
you had a win in the first round as well. this is a great upset. what do you think are your prospects for the rest of the tournament?
back to where you clashed in the third or second set, were you surprised by his reaction? it's quite unsportsmanlike for him.
was actually happened?
of all the upsets that you're familiar with in sports, not just involving you, anybody, how would you compare this one?
of all of the surprising results in sports, how would you compare this one?
do you think once the centre court was covered it changed the condition of the game? do you think it changed the conditions?
you said you just hoped to play three good sets but were probably expecting to go out. how does this affect your plans?
how is it possible that you were never ranked higher than 65?
what did your coach tell you?
before this your best win was what?
now it's wide open, so i guess the other players are pleased.
which surface is your favorite?
about the davis cup match against argentina.
the last two times you came off the bench really quick. was that because you smelled blood?
in the last set.
what did you feel when you won and dove onto the grass?
how does it feel to be the first japanese man to reach the third round at wimbledon since matsuoka in '95, 17 years?
did you know that stat before you went onto the court?
i read that you went to a tennis camp that he ran when you were a young boy. is that true?
are you still in contact with him now?
what did he say in the email? can you tell us? he's happy for you, i guess?
that's fine. was he someone you modeled your game on? did you look up to him when you were young and tried to play the way he played?
he reached the quarterfinal here that year in '95 and eventually lost to sampras. do you feel you could get that far this year? the way you're playing, you look in good form.
if it's soeda, is he a guy that you practice with a lot when you're on tour?
that will be very hard then to play him?
you have to put it to one side, the friendship, forget about it?
can i just ask you, all slams are important to you and you've been in a quarterfinal before, but how important is it to you to be this far through the draw at wimbledon? is it a special slam?
do you think it will be big news back at home?
these guys will make it.
what happened out there? was he just too good?
you were complaining a little bit about something he was doing at one point. what was it that he was doing that was bothering you?
what were your thoughts about the decision to delay the fifth set and close the roof?
is it frustrating for you to see a guy who is hitting forehand winners 100 miles an hours, putting in first serves anytime he needs it?
when was the last time somebody served that well against you, especially in a fifth set?
do you think by not playing well in the first three sets maybe you gave him some confidence that he could actually win?
you've said many, many times how much you love wimbledon. can you talk about your feeling now inside after the result?
when you were told that the roof was going to be closed, you appeared to be surprised. did you not expect that?
had you been told beforehand that the roof might be closed because of the light?
this loss makes you feel more like powerful inside to fight for the gold medal?
you play always wanting to win, and then this loss is a disappointed as well. does this loss give you more energy inside to fight for the gold medal?
you said you were going to take the rest you need and deserve. are you in some ways exhausted by the last four months?
after what you saw of your opponent, particularly in the last set, do you think he can go on to be a threat in this tournament? can he achieve more wins? can he go a long way in the tournament?
he's 26.
what surprised you most today about your own performance?
that was a good win for you, wasn't it?
can you tell me what your coaching situation is?
you beat a player today who said earlier in the week that men and women shouldn't be paid the same because women don't play as long matches. do you think it looks a bit foolish given you beat him in straight sets?
so you don't you share his thought?
you got the break back. how important was it for you? were you focusing on that? you were afraid of getting to a tiebreak.
do you feel there's a difference the way the courts are playing this year?
i see you a lot in bradenton. how do you like it there? nick has been a great mentor for you, too.
it seems tennis is favoring the mature, veteran players. do you find that experience is helping you more now?
what do you feel made the difference?
do you feel the fact you're playing the home favorite was a factor in the decision?
you had a discussion with the umpire during the tiebreak. what did you say?
you're clearly upset about it. do you think you would have won without the footfaults?
obviously it must also get into your head when you're preparing to serve.
did you ask the umpire why?
you said you've never done 11. what's the most you've ever been called for and when was that?
will you complain, take this further now?
you see people blow up about individual line calls. you kept calm about it on court really.
you're obviously upset because you thought you had a chance to win.
will you look back at the film of the recording of the match and see if it was properly done?
but you don't think murray was in any way involved in that?
you think wimbledon are so desperate for andy murray to win, that's what happened today?
you think they were biased?
congratulations on your win today. how would you assess your wimbledon so far?
there has been a lot of talk about obviously your performance at roland garros against roger federer. suddenly people are looking at you and suddenly you're a name. does that change the way you think about things and approach matches?
is grass a surface that you have played on quite a lot as a youngster, or is it something that you're still learning?
obviously the top 4 in men's tennis is cemented. those guys are very established. then there's obviously other players like del potro and ferrer, but then people are looking at a new generation and your name has been tipped as one of the new generation, one of the new kids on the block. do you see yourself in that role? do you think you can actually go on? where do you set your sights?
4 hours, 30 minutes, how did you of after that?
just the length of the match, it has to feel good on a lot of different levels just with your conditioning, your heart; you got through all these things.
coming back maybe before you were ready and getting through a long match, all these things are...
a month or so ago when you were being rolled in for the procedure. if someone said, don't worry, you'll win a couple rounds at wimbledon...
you seemed to be cajoling yourself throughout. was it quite frustrating?
how much do you prove things to yourself now as you test the waters after what happened and gain confidence in your fitness and ability?
one of the things you've experienced is missing time on the tour. what sense of appreciation does that give you for the durability and the dominance of those three guys at the top over the last seven years who have won 28 of the last 29 slams?
andy roddick yesterday called it a golden age of tennis. how would you describe what we've seen and experienced with those guys over the last seven years?
in terms of the weaponry, you have that incredible federer forehand, the heavy nadal forehand, maybe the backhand or return of djokovic. which do you think is the foremost stroke?
switch to the mental side. can you distinguish the mental toughness of rafa with his tenacity and the three of them?
did it feel like you were up against the world no.173 today?
any words of encouragement you can give to him?
talking about his serve, talking about the top three, is it interesting they're doing this incredible dominance and none of them really have a monster serve?
what do you know about david goffin?
who are you going to talk to to get some scouting on him?
talk to jesse levine who just played him?
so it's been a long road back to get to a main draw. what was it like to be back to this level and playing a slam again? talk about your experience.
what was the night like for you?
why was your ban halved?
so why was it halved? did you offer substantial assistance to the authorities?
you have never given any information about other players to the authorities?
are you being coldshouldered in the locker room?
some of them were putting it in pretty strong terms, calling you a snitch, saying you should have served your full term.
you've done a pretty good job so far sort of rebuilding your career. do you find it harder to rebuild your reputation within the sport?
andy roddick in the next round, it could have been an attractive matchup.
just for tennis reasons? andy was a pretty vocal critic.
do you think what you said today will clear the air in the locker room?
why did you have hgh in the first place?
no, just to finish off what you said.
the treatment you had the last two years, media and other players, do you think it's really unfair for you?
what is your goal now going forward on this season?
must have been frustrating to be so close and have to wait for quite a while to finish it off.
can you upset the wimbledon crowd tomorrow and beat andy murray?
you've played him a few times in the past. what makes you think you can win?
were you surprised how easily he beat davydenko?
how does it feel to end a match with an ace?
obviously people talk a lot about your serve. do you ever feel you don't get credit for the other parts of your game sufficiently?
you know your serve best. how is it operating at the moment?
maybe you don't want to answer this question, but who would you say are the best players at returning your serve?
you've had some great results here, especially in 2009. how would you say your form compares to then?
is there anything you can learn or take from a win today into the next match?
the world record that you had, do you feel you still have it? there is such a huge gap. somebody's taken it from you, and there is such a huge gap, 160odd, do you think you maybe have the official record, or maybe that was a strange one?
you seem to quite enjoy having a laugh on twitter. is there a certain type of comedy that you like?
you must be looking forward to playing under the roof or having the roof if it rains. is centre court one of your favorite courts?
fognini, he was sort of frustrated. did you notice that? did you feel he didn't think in his possibilities?
you and fognini both play at a fast pace. do you like that at a player, and do you think it's more enjoyable for fans?
you played on both show courts now. can you talk about what the conditions are like? mardy fish said the balls are very heavy.
speaking of roddick, it takes a lot to keep coming back to a place where you've experienced a lot of disappointment. do you think it's hard as a player to come back to a place where you've been close, haven't been over the hump, or do you think it's more emboldening?
do you have any sympathy for him?
how close he's come.
only three men withdrew before the tournament started this year, which is a big drop over the last five years. do you think the increased prize money for firstround losers is factor in that? because it went up 25% for firstround losers.
do you think it's good that the money went up so much for the firstround losers?
gilles simon has come out and said he doesn't agree with equal prize money at the slams. should it be talked about at the players council?
probably nobody's played rafa and novak more than you. could you talk about their baseline games, their offense to defense, their weaponry?
how would you characterize the difference in their movement?
did you ever hit the crossbar out on the court today, like the soccer kicks?
you played pretty well today.
obviously we have the top three in this really dominate position. could you give us your analysis of why there's been the separation of the three of you.
could you take a minute and talk about your two rivals and talk about their baseline games, defense to offense.
what advice would you have for someone who is all of a sudden playing an indoor match at wimbledon? anything you should know? can you prepare for that?
two tactical things from tonight's match: it seemed like you got a lot out of approaching to his backhand. doesn't seem like he could hurt you. is it something you think he needs to work on? you seem to hit your forehand down the line. is that going to be an important shot for you at this tournament?
talk more about roger a little bit more. what it's like up there against him? does that variety ever astound you?
how did it feel to be back on court after a few months with injury?
did you have any nerves beforehand after being out for a while and worried how you might come back?
was it a bit of a hard process to come back on grass, especially, in your first match?
firstever win at wimbledon. it must be a great moment.
you had a great run in australia. is it in your mind that you could emulate that run here, do the same again?
you called for treatment at one point during the match today. what was the problem?
it won't affect your second round? you'll be able to play okay?
what happened in the first few games of that match?
thomaz said you don't have any weakness in your game. is that what you think?
we know the olympics are going to be played here as well. tell us a little bit about your thoughts about having the olympics on grass here.
is it crazy for you or a crazy idea in general?
last time you went behind so far in a first set was against soderling a couple years ago. you came back and went on to win the championships. do you find that sort of start helps you to focus your mind?
do you find it difficult to change from clay court to grass, and how do you adjust?
i am not going to ask you would you want to win tomorrow in eurocup semifinals, but could you talk a little bit about the portuguese team and cristiano ronaldo? i know you met him before.
everyone has a greatest rival. who would that be for you? is this someone you really prefer not to play in the tournament? if you could sometimes tell us your dream, what should be.
the first question is, everybody has their greatest competitor, rival. who would that be for you? maybe you're special and you don't care.
rosol.
you haven't lost in the first week of a major for seven years now. when you found yourself down in the first set, does something like that give you some confidence that you can come through those earlyround matches even when it's tough?
do you think germany has a chance against spain? are you scared at all by any german player? what do you think about the team?
whether you consider them rivals or not, you, novak, and roger have certainly dominated the grand slams for the last seven years. what do you think the biggest reason for that is?
what is the gesture you did in celebration?
nothing to do with pointing to heaven and god, is it?
it was a helluva start, that quality of tennis.
a combination of the slice and then going to the forehand as well, is causing all kinds of problems, isn't it?
is it one of those days where since the moment you walked out on court, you looked like you were comfortable in your own skin.
immediately after the match, there's been a lot of talk in the buildup to this tournament. is there a part of you that likes proving something to people who maybe doubt you?
there was a sense of urgency brought on by the weather, trying to beat the rain or darkness.
just wondered how much motivation you drew from the quite cutting and scathing comments by some former and current players over the weekend. your response to being called a drama queen, for example.
such a convincing victory was a good way of silencing your few doubters.
this summer would you rather win the wimbledon or the olympic medal?
is it still special, wimbledon?
there's now five in the second round. how delighted are you for james and the three girls to be there?
comparing two and three years ago, do you think this time you're coming to wimbledon with less pressure? if yes, does it help you?
what is your first conscious memory of the player ivan lendl when you were a kid?
the olympic wildcards were announced. do you have an opinion on who should carry the flag, and is it something you would be interested in doing?
in the opening ceremony.
what would be the difference for you playing wimbledon and the olympics on the same arena?
in what way?
looks like it's going to be ivo karlovic next. a completely different match than today. do you enjoy the challenge of facing someone like him on grass?
one of your great strengths is your returning. do you look at the karlovic match and think, let's see how the returns are at the moment?
for the sheer joy of going back and playing with some legend from past times, who would you choose to have an imaginary match against?
what did you learn from andre?
how do you prepare for playing somebody as up in the air as karlovic? if you're going to play a lefty, you sort out a lefty to practice with. do you get danny to stand on a box or something?
what did you make of that performance?
you received a wild card for the olympics today.
are you disappointed you didn't make doubles?
can you talk a little bit about the support you have here and being such a crowd favorite? you've won this tournament. do you feel that jo has what it takes to win this?
how confident are you that you'll be back here next year?
a general question: you're a student of tennis history. if you could go back and play any of the great legends for the fun of it, what player would you enjoy playing against?
because of his great volleys?
when you go out fairly routinely in the first or second rounds of tournaments, does it make you want to compete more or less?
this is the first time an aussie hasn't been in the second round of wimbledon since 1938. we've heard that australian sport is on decline. is that justified?
if i could invite you to talk about cricket in the olympics as well, because obviously these are big things.
and the cricket this summer?
we see a lot of older players playing right now, but we don't see a lot of younger players or very old players winning majors. do you think the window of opportunity has been squeezed to a smaller age race? and if so, why?
given that you don't know when you're finishing up, lleyton, there's occasions like this that you sort of let yourself allow to look around or an extra special kind of instinct regarding...
bernie came in before and said he hadn't been working hard enough and seemed all over the place. do you have any advice to give to him to continue what he did in january?
can you share with us your memories about winning against nalbandian?
there's some who suggest maybe the depth on the men's tour isn't quite what it used to be. can you talk about the depth of this group right now compared to the previous generation.
why are the top three so dominant?
you're a veteran. how satisfied are you that the doping policy is working and keeping the sport clean?
the grass court season being extended for three weeks, is that something you're in favor of?
yes.
you must be very pleased with your performance. you hung in there very well and got stronger as you went on after a shaky start.
he has a fairly unique game. he's a wonderful ball striker and takes the pace off. did that make it easier or harder for you to find your game and express your game in its best way?
did you ask anyone how to play him? did anyone give you information about his game?
do you prefer the big stage? do you think you play better and can motivate more when there are a lot of people around?
is wimbledon a special tournament for you, or is roland garros your favorite?
during the fourth set today you seemed really calm, and you seemed to concentrate on your service games. is this true or were you nervous inside?
you played roger federer in paris. now there is a little bit of distance. what did you take out of this game, and did it give you a lot of confidence? you played him very well.
did your life change since you played roger federer?
do you feel more pressure in a way, now that you have all this attention?
now that you've played federer, does he feel any less superhuman to you? you said you idolized him as a kid. does federer seem a little less superhuman to you now that you've played him?
you'll play at the olympics in a few weeks' time. are you more confident for that now that you've got a win on the grass?
did you find your game is good for grass? you love wimbledon, of course. what's your favorite surface?
so i assume it's ice on your shoulder rather than some kind of fetish?
is that a precautionary measure or?
this is your first appearance in the main draw at wimbledon.
you have won very convincingly today. what were your thoughts on the match?
can i be a little bit annoying and ask you to tell a story you're probably already sick of telling.
just a quick little appraisal of what happened with you leaving the tennis and then coming back?
since roland garros, what is the most interesting or most surprising thing that's happened, the most fun thing?
and overall, what has it felt like to sort of pingpong between the excitement, competition of the pro circuit and surgery, the anonymity of being a kid and an assistant coach?
what was like the worst moment when you thought it was just all over?
what degree are you doing?
what degree is it?
after all the attention you got at roland garros and then found out you didn't get the wildcard for wimbledon, you get here, you're thinking business as usual, sort of back to qualifying, challenger...
how much are you better now than before all the surgeries?
i know you had a lot of family with you before the french open. who do you have here with you?
did you take some time to kind of soak up the atmosphere on court today given you've never been in the main draw? might not have made it with all these surgeries.
do you remember being this confident before? if so, what period of your career was that?
have you ever been away from home this long?
how is your body holding up? you played like eight matches in nice.
must be feeling niggles.
so your life is sort of this collection of preparing for surgeries, recovering from surgeries, preparing for tests and so forth. then you finally come and you walk up to roland garros or you come up to the all england club, what goes through your mind at those moments when you come to these great venues?
in paris you said that, hey, i'm doing some pretty cool things, something to that effect. what's your selftalk when you step back and see these runs, these results? what do you say to yourself?
you had said earlier  i think in the spring  about how the first time you felt a little bits of twinges after coming onto the court. you were immediately worried. how long did it take you to get over that feeling where you can say, this is just a niggle. i'll ice as a precaution, or i'm not worried about...
i read it in one of the stories.
what's been the reception from your fellow american players? did you ever play isner at all in juniors?
what's your greatest strength and greatest weakness as assistant coach for belmont?
do you feel you have much of an advantage over the guys you're playing now because you might have seen more of their games than they've seen of you, or is that not really the case?
can you go through your match and assess it.
did you get any info on him or?
in terms of the business element of coming back, can you describe that a little bit?
coach?
what about your relationship with the usta? can you go to them as a support?
did you feel it was a tough draw when you first saw who you were going to be playing?
the umpire at 34 in the second set, there was a hawkeye challenge. did that have an impact on how the match was going?
you thought you should have won the point; instead you replayed the point.
must also have been frustrating how many breakpoints you had the first set, but he played well.
back to the draw, i guess it was a consequence of what happened at queen's that you weren't seeded. is that something which is particularly frustrating?
do you feel sometimes the officials were against you, as well?
yes.
do you think the umpire shouldn't overrule given that you have hawkeye now?
ten years on from reaching the final here, did you feel you had good support from the crowd?
you said in an interview that i read today you had a lot of support over the line's judge incident at queen's. has anybody said anything bad to you since then?
you're pleased with the support you've had since then?
it's been mentioned the police spoke to you about that; is that true?
presumably you said the same thing, that this was bad luck?
have they indicated what they might do, the police?
do you feel that one got away from you? and how so?
what did you do leading up to here? did you prepare any differently or just try and relax about the french or what was the process?
is there something going on familywise you can share with us?
i assume you had a game plan before you went out on court. so when you go out on court, you're forgetting what you talked about before?
after you lost the fourthset breaker, i'm thinking that might have been critical because you have to go into the fifth again, or are you thinking about france or thinking about lopez in australia that is sort of inevitable that in the fifth you're not going to be able to pull it off?
is being selfcritical and feeling clouded a function of losing a bit of confidence that you're thinking too much, you're not letting things flow?
first time you've experienced something like that?
you had some really strong results this season. when did the lack of confidence start to creep in?
one person has to win, and sometimes maybe it's not all about you. could it also be maybe a little bit your opponent? paris was a tough match. it's like it's hard, you know, to blame you. but don't you think sometimes the opponent...
in the big picture, you were really known for your mental strength and your fighting ability early. this year you have had just some great wins, great performances, and now kind of a big funk. can you just put confidence and tennis in a bigger context? is it fickle and it comes and goes?
is there kind of a two steps forward and then steps back? top american, top 10.
are you trying to push yourself forward on big points? are you saying to yourself, yeah, go, move, move? because at times when he was taking the initiative...
are you going to stay on grass for a while with a the olympics coming up? what are your plans now?
are you in doubles here?
so you don't know what your plans are.
you have atlanta, don't you, and something else?
it looks like or...
you got a chance to work on your serve and volley a lot today. how did it feel?
the serve and volley, is that a case of experimenting because of the score?
it's a balance, isn't it, between how well the returner returns and the height of the bunts? what goes into your decision to serve and volley?
would you comment about your friend tiger woods who had a couple good days at the u.s. open and then fell off. can you talk about his performance and the challenge there.
how would you compare the racquet you play with now with the racquet you played with here as a junior in terms of the quality of the strings, the tension, the graphite, all that stuff? how different would it be?
you have won here many times. is it still special for you, the moment you walk in?
when you think about the last several years, the domination of the slams of you three guys, what do you think have been the biggest factors for that domination?
you had not been on court1 for a firstround match here in a long time. what was your reaction when you saw the schedule?
were you surprised?
i spoke before with fognini, who is your next opponent. you played him first time when he was a kid in australia. he said after that you became no.1 in the world. what do you know about him? what do you appreciate of him?
can i ask you about our big home hope. i don't think you played andy since the final in dubai. do you think he'll be there in the last kind of four?
yes.
one of the websites was saying you took a golf club out on court. can you clear that up?
could you hear them?
were you tempted to go out in the warmup and see how you got on?
was it your idea?
yesterday you spoke about what the federer/nadal rivalry has meant to you. what are your thoughts on what playing against rafa has brought out of you and what you make of your rivalry with him at this point?
just to follow up, what do you think rafa has brought out of you?
what was it like to walk out on centre court, first match on monday as the defending champion?
could you speak a little bit about the atmosphere of the centre court. a lot of players used to say it's very quiet. do you agree?
do you remember your first game against ferrero seven years ago on clay, and how much do you think your game has changed?
earlier in your career you went through a tough time where you had some injuries and people were critical. andy murray is going through his back injuries. some are questioning what's happening. what are your thoughts about andy and when an athlete has injuries and there's skepticism about it?
how do you relax when you're in wimbledon, and is your girlfriend here at the moment?
what is the dog's name?
is he gluten free?
which gave you the greater pleasure, winning the trophy or being able to contribute to that cause with all those exhibitions?
(question about ivan.)
were you actually worried about if you had to go through the scenario of coming off court as a loser and go out to do the fun and games? was that ever a worry for you?
the match itself was a little up and down. how did you read it? you came good in the end.
from where you were, say, a week ago today, you'd have settled for this, all the different types of matches and scenarios?
how concerned were you when you fell over in that first set? it sounded painful.
it's fine? everything else physically, you've come through fine this week?
of all the celebs, andy, which one would you say has the most promise as a player?
twitter is debating about some comments about whether you were donating your players money to the cause as well as the money raised from run against cancer.
you look in good shape as wimbledon is a week away. people are never going to stop talking. where do you think you stand compared with previous years? stronger?
you talk about a week being a long time in sport. i think we find this week the most exacting building up to it. do you as well? do you find the week between here and wimbledon you actually want to get going? it's hard to relax?
does it feel any different heading towards wimbledon having the gold medal, us open?
three times a queen's winner. that's not been done too many times. sum up how you feel right now having won that trophy after the last month you have had.
i know it's a little disappointing to lose a final, and you were the defending champion, but how do you view that match? you actually had a chance of winning.
do you think at the end, that final set, what was the actual difference between the two? because andy came on really strongly.
with wimbledon just a week away, how do you assess your form? it's been a great week for you. wimbledon is starting just eight days from now.
particularly in the first two sets, there wasn't really much there at all and you had break points on andy in the second set, as well. what do you think changed? was there some point that changed the sway of the match towards the third set?
he seemed to improve as the match went on. did you see it like that, as well? particularly in the third set, he seemed much stronger than he was in the first set.
with wimbledon just a week away, what do you make of your form? you looked like you could go deep into the tournament. do you think?
in that form, do you think andy  and everyone in britain wonders will he win wimbledon? do you think he's in the form that he could win the championships?
for anybody?
well done in the end?
thanks for finishing on our deadline. do you get a sense of urgency sometimes with the light coming in and trying to get the match out of the way, or is it hard to maintain a sense of calm?
were you part of the discussion about moving the matches, you know, going to 1? how did that evolve as far as you were concerned?
did you beat him at table football, as well?
how comfortably?
what would you have felt if you had been in lleyton's and marin's position and they had to switch courts, something like that?
was there a better way of doing it? what would have been a better way?
when you have been out for a while, is there any sense of relief when the second and third sets, when you start playing that level, go up another level? how does that feel, you think?
how much better do you feel and happier with yourself do you feel now than you did at the start of the week?
i saw mark bender was in your player's box today. have you been working with him?
in the sense of preparation for wimbledon, come tomorrow do you feel like what you have achieved already has put you in absolutely the place where you want to be going into wimbledon now?
you have a very good record against marin. how do you see the final?
tough conditions at times again today, but did you feel to an extent that that became a bit harder than it should have been?
is it a physical thing? is it a concentration thing?
if it is jo that you play in the semis, how much of a step up will that be for you?
is he one of the players you enjoy playing against? nice style to play against?
having had the back injury, has it been in your mind at all in matches at all this week, and particularly on grass, which can be slippery, do you ever just hold back at all, thinking about your back?
have you seen anything of hewitt's run through the week? what do you think of his achievements this week?
i'm wondering what it's like playing here. the crowd can be slightly less animated, shall we say, than most places. does that kind of permeate through to you or make it more difficult?
what was your expectation coming in here this week?
what is it about certain places that certain players like to play? and why especially do you think you do so well here?
this is the first semifinal i think since you made the final in newport last year. it's like a lot of stuff in between. is it like all worth it for the events you really like?
obviously this is part of the bigger picture to you, but is it hard not to look now only two wins away from another title, potentially?
when was the last time you felt so comfortable on a court where you're playing these few matches, and, as you were saying the other day, the way you even played that match at the french open?
probably been a while since you played backtoback matches for a while. how is the body holding up?
how different is it to have family around? obviously you're not taking your eye off the ball, having to take care of them all the time, but does it feel a little different just having your little ones here and enjoying the experience?
is results like this incentive for you to keep pushing yourself?
you touched on your age a few moments ago. do you think about that at all when you're going out to play a match or going into a tournament?
you mentioned you really look forward to these four weeks. there's going to be that extra week in the future between the french open and wimbledon. do you look forward to there being more grass court tennis? do you think it should be a bigger part of the calendar, maybe even bigger than that's going to be?
is there one outstanding memory of your first victory here, one you can bring to mind?
it won't be sunday, i don't think.
obviously there is the language thing and stuff, but why have you always been so comfortable in london?
how often do you take advantage of i know it's only four weeks or three weeks of the year that you're in london, but how often have you taken advantage of the membership?
do you get into the clubhouse for afternoon tea, as well?
where is the tie?
how do you assess that?
last game, few swings there, as well?
do you feel like you're playing the best you have played in quite some time?
what is it about grass that suits your game so well? you have had so much success, but you're not a goran ivanisevic type of player, you don't serve and volley hardly. why do you think you have had so much success on grass?
how do you get yourself ready for a match like this when you know the conditions are still so slick and you've got somebody with an almighty serve? it comes down to a bit of a crapshoot out there?
do you see how tommy haas is doing? he's had so much success over the last year. do you think if you had pretty deep runs in a tournament maybe you could start getting direct entry into more tournaments, higher seeds, byes, make a run like him?
a bit like night and day from the other day to today?
considering your history on grass, the fact that you have won this tournament on a number of occasions, and you look at dimitrov being seeded at 10 over here, would you classify this as an upset?
how much confidence do you take out of this going forward? do you have a bit of momentum going?
what about sam next match for you?
you're playing doubles here with bernie. are you surprised how well he seems to roll through things, despite everything else going on around him?
your victory today is a breath of fresh air back home in australia, and encouraging some good news, because on the cricket side there is some bad news. i was just wondering  i don't know whether you're up to speed about david warner, whether the whole image of australia being over here in england, what you think that perception is.
the other day you were saying how pleased you were to get off the clay and get back onto the grass. when you're transitioning between the clay and the grass, what is the bigger issue: the mental aspect of it, of going from one surface, two extremes of surfaces, or is it the footwork?
how are you feeling with the doubles coming up?
with the rain delay and everything like that, must be nice to get on and off the court quickly in your first grass match?
how difficult is it to get your footing when it's still a fresh grass court? does it enter your mind that, you know, it could be a bit dangerous, or do you allow yourself to think you've got to be careful?
you just joined twitter. talk about it. why did it take you so long to join up?
you have been tweeting a lot. can you keep up that rate as...
are you surprised at how quickly you've picked up 10,000 followers, almost 10,000?
do you think that maybe the tour should allow you to take your phones on court and in the middle the match you can tweet?
"this guy is playing ridiculous" or something?
just getting back to the grass, for you, what is the bigger issue when you are transferring from clay or hard court to grass or the other way? is it the mental side, or is it the footwork that you're more concerned with? is it a mental aspect about i've got to think about this, or just really working your feet on it?
how did you pull up after that?
what were you thinking in that third set when you were down and had to fight back so hard? that must have taken a lot of heart for that comeback.
what would you put it down to? he was obviously serving pretty well.
when were you able to start in again after paris?
your dad was obviously back in your corner today. did that help you at all?
have you made any changes to your setup, your coaching staff?
you said you didn't know your dad was there. did you expect him to be here today?
when you said you made changes in your setup in terms of what's happening in monaco, is that with your management or coaching or...
can we just clarify with the hitting partner, thomas drouet, is that who you're referring to?
drouet.
apart from doubles here with lleyton, what's next week? eastbourne or what are you doing?
next up for you is mr.murray. your thoughts on that?
how much of an advantage would it be that you have had a match today on grass whereas this will be murray's first match?
what's the secret to beating him? what did you learn last year?
do you feel, given his recent layoff, that you're more confident with pulling off the same result this year?
what was your injury?
you have had a lot of wins here, haven't you? what is it about playing here that brings the best out of you?
what are your reflections on your match today? were you pleased with your return to the grass?
what do you make of the experience? how do you think you played today, kyle?
the transition from clay to grass is obviously one of the trickiest. the surface is obviously a little slick anyway, given the conditions. footwork a little bit tricky at the start?
you got back to london saturday night?
hit sunday?
any notable people on the other side of the net?
you weren't on court with andy or anything?
what's the hardest lesson for you to learn on grass?
how hopeful are you of getting a wimbledon wildcard? how would you relish that challenge if it came up?
no indication or anything about tomorrow?
tomorrow? what will you do the rest of the week?
have you been playing at the ntc since you came back?
so close, james. very disappointing for you?
is there anything on thebig points you would have done differently?
sort of a davis cup dress rehearsal a little bit. he's a class player from what you discovered in that encounter, and...
are you happy with things at the moment as compared to things a year ago?
how do you assess that?
is it tough playing someone you know so well?
how are you feeling in general about your grass season?
did you take any consolation from seeing ferrer make the final in paris?
in general, what are your expectations over the next couple of weeks?
if you get through the next round, you potentially have a crack at andy. what would that mean?
what's the bigger aspect as far as going from clay to grass? is it, one, the footwork aspect, the movement, or two, getting your mind adjusted, the mental aspect of going from clay to grass?
how long did it take you once you got onto the grass to feel reasonably comfortable?
bernie has only just rolled into town the last couple of days. has he given himself enough time to make that adjustment?
you had to work for that one, didn't you?
would you have preferred to play the doubles match before that?
why are you still doing this? you have money in the bank, a young family you probably prefer to be home with. why are you doing it?
how important is the second game of the second set that went forever and ever?
you come here, and obviously you've won it four times. is it still a special place for you?
following onto the question why you're continuing to play, what are your ambitions as far as wimbledon is concerned?
how much longer do you think you can keep going?
do you keep getting asked it?
can you remember playing in conditions like that before?
a bit harsh to get a warning, then?
what if any impact do you think this has on your match at wimbledon? do you think it means anything in those terms?
it was so tight the first two sets. were you a bit surprised by the third?
you have reached the quarterfinals, what, three times, didn't you, at wimbledon? how would you assess...
how does it feel to get your first grass court title?
good win. how do you feel about facing lopez tomorrow and then again in the first round?
it was pretty convincing out there at times today. was it comfortable at times?
just the opponent.
it's been quite a week. on monday you were limping off the practice court. now you're in the final. were you unsure at the start of the week whether you could play?
to go back to kyle, what was your impression of him? because obviously there is a lot of buzz about him at the moment.
which game would you rather win, the game tomorrow or the first round wimbledon game?
you seemed a little unhappy at the end of the first set about the...
how do you feel about that now? do you feel disappointed you're not taking more notice of?
what was this sort of friendly exchange at the net at the end? are you good friends with him?
back to the conditions, was it just that you weren't able to the play the way you wanted to, or did you think it was dangerous out there?
and also you thought the court was dangerous?
did you consider defaulting?
how was that? roller coaster of a game.
you served really well particularly in the first set.
were you getting ahead of yourself sort of thing?
how was the leg today? was that an issue?
yesterday and today, what does it mean for you going into next week?
first time you have won backtoback matches i think since beginning of february. so talk us through a little bit about that kind of streak. was it a confidence issue? was it physical? bad luck?
right now physically just with your leg and everything, rebounding from, you know, a long threesetter, are you feeling okay?
can you just talk us through the match? because the first set and the second set were two different animals, it seemed.
is there something about the grass that maybe this year even isn't really suiting you?
you and ivan, it's early days, but i mean, is it a big change from the previous regime? maybe it's something to get used to?
so just given all that, what's your mental state going into wimbledon, i mean, considering what's happened the last couple of weeks?
after our emphatic wins in the davis cup and your great win in san jose against tommy haas, do you think there is any elements that are missing in your game now since those great moments that you had about three, four months ago?
despite the defeat, you must be absolutely delighted with your performance again.
did it mean a lot more to play that well against a player who is obviously so highly ranked?
have you been surprised at all how your game stood up so well against the top guys this week?
do you get nervous playing players of that caliber or are you focused on yourself?
are you going to begin to fall in love with grass?
you even seemed to have the british sea gulls on your side.
if you could choose for wimbledon, would you like centre court or just play on an outside court?
tell me about today briefly. is losing in two tiebreaks all the same a great performance but all in all a bit frustrating?
how much pressure do you feel at the moment? because the aura that you give off on court is as someone who is very confident, someone with a much higher ranking.
the whole experience of the last week or so at queen's and that first atp win, how has that been?
your feelings going into next week must be very exciting.
where do you think you can go from here? obviously andy murray is not going to last forever. you're sort of a young prospect, and people look at you to sort of be the next sort of grand slam winner, as well.
yeah. obviously you've got big shoes to fill when andy murray retires.
there are probably a lot of people now who know you who didn't know you a few weeks ago because of your results and leading up to wimbledon. are you ready for that level of interest and expectations? it's a big change for you in such a short period of time.
how does that feel, first win with the big boys?
there didn't seem to be any nerves out there even when you were serving for the match. how do you explain that?
do you think in a sense the experience of last week at queen's stood you in good stead here today? because you had a bit of frustration, and you just wanted to put that right, so to speak?
there's about 360 places between you and him.
do you feel intimidated by someone like that?
a 133mileanhour second serve, and you got it back and won the point.
given that you don't play on the tour regularly, how do you find out with someone like him, do you have an analysis you look at before who provides you with that?
which surface are you most comfortable? you have done very well in paris, of course.
and now the courts here.
are you okay? there was an incident back of the court...
how exciting is this? first title on home soil. had time to sink in?
any congratulator texts on the phone?
i was going to say, you must be excited about going to go to melbourne anyway, but now after winning eight matches in a row and a title, can your heart pump any faster?
what do you think is possible down there next week given your confidence?
not many people you'll be facing in melbourne serve at 216 kilometers an hour.
was it huge, too, to get the break right out of the gate? he seemed like he was a little bit nervous and you got that lead right at the start.
42 in the first set, when someone in the crowd started singing some 50 cent, i think you joined in. is that just how relaxed you were out there?
you were you surprised how calm you were? first final. that a sign of what you've been through the past few years?
in perth you had three wins, traveled all the way over here, and another five wins. are you fatigued at all? can you go fiveset matches in melbourne?
what have you done physically? obviously work on the court, but have you done crosstraining? kayaking? rowing machine?
how are you going to celebrate?
what about the crowd itself? it was a nice electric atmosphere out there. how did that feel?
what did your dad say to you? it's been quite a journey since you were 12, 13.
people said john probably wasn't best person to coach you. clearly he is.
how badly were you suffering in the first set? was there ever a chance you thought of maybe retiring?
what did you eat?
how would you rate your performance today?
after the match you said, it's about time. do you feel it's long overdue?
seven matches in a row now: three in perth and four here. couldn't have asked for anything better, i presume.
where does the final sit in terms of milestones in your career? obviously wimbledon and australian open you've gone deep. where does the chance to win something sit?
how much of your turnaround from last year is mental to, say, physical and getting more fit and rested?
you started last year pretty well as well. you had a great run in brisbane. it's going to be further down the line, but the problems you experienced last year, have you put stuff in place to make sure that doesn't happen?
it was obviously tough out there today. in the past do you think you would have stayed as composed as you did and as tough as you did?
you got a ticket for james tomorrow night? what about melbourne?
you seen the melbourne draw?
anything further?
how much do you think you've improved since the last time you played roger?
what was the best piece of advice you got going into this season, or one of the best pieces of advice?
todd woodbridge said yesterday that leaving you out of the first davis cup tie has had the desired effect. was that the trigger?
the opponent or the heat? both, i suppose.
i know it's an individual sport, but you're the first south african to get into the finals.
when the match goes that long, how much are you reacting and how much do you actually think about what you're doing?
what did you do to turn it around in the first set? just working on your own game or did he make changes?
thoughts on the other guys you could be playing. tomic has a lot of support here.
how do you recover now? ice bath?
will you be watching a bit more tennis now?
just your thoughts on the time violations and the rules becoming a little more strict that way.
did you take a hand vote before it was passed? some of the guys were saying there wasn't really a vote taken; some guys say there was.
did you discuss it with all the players before the council took a vote? they must have known about it to some degree.
so andy murray said last week he thinks he's in favor of the rule as long's it's extended to 30 seconds rather than 25. he doesn't think 25 is enough, especially when you go deep in matches.
what do you expect next week in a slam?
into the semifinal. how far can you go for the rest of the week?
will be it extra special to make your first final in australia?
looked like today you had to really think your way through this match. you didn't start off really well, struggling with your rhythm maybe. take us through your thought process.
why were you more nervous tonight?
in that first set, what did you have to do to change it around?
you must have one eye on the open. do you feel like you're where you need to be?
did you hit balls again after the match tonight?
if you had that time tonight, what would you have practiced?
incredible start to the year for you. what do you put it down to?
why did you chose hopman as opposed to, say, brisbane?
how is your record against benneteau?
the results in perth were very impressive. did you get confidence that you didn't have before?
is the serve and volley the area you noticed the most improvement?
there seems to have been a few injuries already and injury concerns leading up to the australian open. as someone that is tall like john isner, is that something you're mindful of, just being a tall guy, managing the injuries and staying injuryfree?
how did you handle the heat the other day?
the way you're conditioned now and having so many solid matches under your belt, could you have had a better preparation for the australian open?
we've lost a lot of serve and volleyers from men's tennis. roger is there. could there be maybe a revival? could you lead a comeback?
are you regretting choosing hopman over brisbane because of the way you're playing?
from 3love down in the tiebreak, you really powered home.
any leftover fatigue from yesterday?
nice to get that win after three losses to florian?
you serve, what does that indicate about where your game is at moment?
what is it about florian's game you found difficult to deal with in the past?
you clocked a 207 serve out there. what's your fastest serve?
has that been the secret, getting more strength in your upper body?
what exactly did you do to improve it?
is it hard not to get overexcited at this point given how good your start to the season has been? just sort of keep it level and not think too far ahead and just play each match at this point?
five men's seeds dropped out of the draw today. were you aware of that? the draw is obviously going to open up a little bit.
you said on court that you were the most confident you've ever been. that's a fairly big statement given what you did at wimbledon and last year and here at the australian open.
what do you know now that you didn't know then when you made that splash at wimbledon?
if the australian open was tomorrow, is your game where you want it to be?
you said you trained yesterday after that game. would you have done that a year ago?
what did you work on today?
davis cup, earlier in the week you said you weren't going to play the second tie. hewitt today won down in kooyong, but in his press conference he said he was unaware that you weren't playing that second tie. have you had a word with pat rafter about that?
you've had a lot of success on these courts here in sydney. what do you put it down to?
the seeds are dropping like flies. you give yourself a good chance of going out and defending your title?
what are your thoughts on either player, bernard or florian?
how hard it was for you this morning? you were expecting to play simon and of course you didn't. when did you find out?
is that off putting? distracting? i suppose it happens a bit.
very close out there. frustrated to get so close for sure.
do you think you were playing within yourself a bit?
must have been pleased with your serve today.
was it always part of your game plan to really peg him back at the baseline like that?
what were the couple areas you weren't happy with?
how big has the last couple weeks been in terms of that going forward with your confidence?
what have you learned about your game this tournament?
when will you head to melbourne? what do you really want to focus on before then as well?
what about the rest of the season beyond the australian summer?
how does that rank? top 15 player, top seed of a tournament; how does that rank?
does anybody get intimidated by john just walking past, let alone playing him?
you were talking about fitness yesterday. you looked a little quicker. do you feel quicker?
you returned pretty well, too, outside of serving.
does it feel a little weird to have no andy roddick on the tennis scene?
so that's four wins in a row with quallies?
it's been a while, five wins in a row, huh?
what are one or two of the biggest things you learned last season that you're looking to use coming into this year?
is the beard any kind of statement?
you got to keep it on if you keep winning.
pleased with that, bernie?
you've got a lovely change of pace. seemed to pull out this lovely forehand down the line. is that something you planned to do or is it something that comes naturally? is it instinct?
you hadn't played him in quite a while in a tournament. did you notice any differences in his game?
you've had some good opportunities already this summer playing novak and australian no.1 tonight. is tomorrow a good opportunity as well?
is the whole year about revenge a little bit?
the racquet you're using, are you using head frame or a yonex racquet?
when did you change the frame?
marinko said there is a big difference in your serve. is that what you spent a lot of time working on?
there has been a lot talk about sam losing last night. you're starting to develop a good record here. what were your feelings before you walked out on court?
how much of the hard work you've done is on the mental side of the game?
is that challenging to keep that up?
you had an olympic medalist and a world champion swimmer in your box. how does swimming and tennis meet up?
given the work you've done on your game, would you say there is a difference in your confidence level as to how you were feeling ahead of the australian open last year?
did you speak to novak at all after beating him in perth?
how long in the ice bath after that match?
your ranking is getting higher every tournament. what are your rankings goals?
it's been a great week or so for you. what do you put it down to, this sudden surge in form?
if you didn't have the shoulder trouble in '11 and '12 you could have been where you wanted to be two years ago. are you frustrated by that, or just one of those things?
top10 player, a former top10 player, what does that do for your confidence?
the excitement though, you must be salivating at the mouth to get down to melbourne?
what are the goals for melbourne then? have you thought about it?
potential second round with andreas. andy murray was probably the biggest match of your career. do you see this one being close to the second biggest?
a fair few australians yesterday were lost yesterday on the women's and men's side. are you prepared for the pressure, the expectation? you're okay with that?
and then the heat and your conditioning, could that potentially be an advantage for you?
do you think that's a massive advantage you have this week, having the experience and knowing you can handle the conditions better than...
how do you assess your performance?
it's very soon after the match, but can you draw some positives from it? what do you take from it?
when was the last time you played him?
obviously you can see changes in his game.
looking forward to going to melbourne now and hit the practice courts? big tournament down there obviously for you.
did you feel if you were going to win it, you were going to have to win it quicker than you won the us open given the physical demands of your semifinal?
could you tell us what happened to your toe and if it restricted you in any way?
had it been an issue throughout the tournament or just today?
how did you pull up after the federer match?
why do you think it took you both so long to get a break in this match? it took over 30 games.
was it a matter of serving better than usual or not returning as well as usual?
did the blisters restrict you?
when you talked to the umpire, were you suggesting people that were shouting out maybe be taken out of the court?
did you have a problem with your left hamstring?
would it be fair to say you were more upbeat after this than after your other losses here?
have you had a chance to have a chat with ivan? and what has he said to you if you have?
the way you and novak play defense, is being a great offensive player sort of a losing proposition at this point? roger in some ways is a relic.
you said you felt more comfortable tonight than you did on court at the us open. in what respect?
given the long time difference between your semifinal and novak's, do you think in the future the tournament should look at having semifinals on the same day?
the feather that drifted into the court, did that distract you?
just to be clear, the blister only occurred in this match? it wasn't a remnant from the federer match or earlier matches?
last year you were in here about 4:00 in the morning. this is a good time to finish, i guess.
how hard was that match for you tonight?
anything noticeably different you did from the us open final to here?
how does this compare with the others you've won, the feeling?
you and andy are two of the best returners in the game, but it took over 30 games in this match before anybody broke. why do you think that was tonight?
andre agassi always played very well in this tournament. you got the trophy from him tonight. is there something similar in your attitudes, styles, that means you tend to start the season in such terrific form?
another major and another semifinal with three of the top four and two of the top four winning. do you think the gap is closing at all or is the gap growing with the rest of the field?
what are your goals for the rest of the season? is the french open a priority for you now?
you had tough losses to rafa and roger and andy in the last three grand slams coming in here. going into today, any special motivation saying that you wanted another grand slam title?
this final and last year were incredibly physical. do you get a sense it's taking stuff out of you or you're just taking it in your stride?
you spoke about andre. are you changing the game, too? if yes, in what aspect do you think?
last year you played the second semifinal, had less rest; this year the opposite. how different is it going into these two finals because of that? do you think they should change anything to make it more even?
do you switch from one surface to another surface?
do you think you're the funnest guy in players nowadays?
i also heard from some ballkids, they said you are always humor. i notice you said hello to jie zheng in chinese in the press conference, too. i want to know about your philosophy in life for humor?
how pleased were you to get off to a good start in the fifth?
what did you say to each other at the changeover after losing the tiebreak?
did you draw on the us open final in particular?
do you think you've ever served as well over such a prolonged period as that before?
five sets in four hours. do you feel that wasn't a reflection of the way you dominated the match?
how satisfying is it to have beaten him in a slam for the first time?
he said that he always felt he was chasing. did it feel that way to you, that you were kind of always ahead?
how surprised were you by what he shouted when you were at the net at 65 in the fourth? you had a funny look on your face at that point.
did it rattle you at all?
can you repeat what he said?
was it a word that we might struggle to get in our newspapers?
your reaction seems to be very lowkey. you're keeping your calm. is that because you still got one big step to go?
between the fourth and fifth sets, do you know you're playing better? were you sure that if you keep it at that level you could close it out?
this will be your first grand slam final as a grand slam champion. is that going to make it easier or...
while not thinking of the us open and the olympics specifically, do you think they've made you mentally sort of more stronger, battle hardened?
this court is said to be slightly slower and higher bouncing than the us open one. if so, is it going to make it any easier for him to play against you?
i know you're a massive fan of a lot of different sports. would you enjoy tennis more if tennis had a little bit more of that rough edge to it publicly instead of sort of reserved gentility?
you said you were feeling tired now. are you confident you'll be fully recovered for sunday, especially given the fact that you'd had five straightsets wins before tonight?
are you doing anything special for robbie burns day?
does the ball still come off his racquet as well as it did when you first played him?
when did you start refueling with bananas?
a year ago when you played novak, have you got closer to him? do you think he's also improved shots and whatever?
did you feel it pull away from you in the first couple games of the fifth set? was that the turning point?
you spoke earlier in the week about the good manners that exist between the players. there definitely seemed to be a bit of feeling between the two of you after 65 in the fourth. can you talk about that. was there an exchange between you?
does it feel like one that got away or one that you were always chasing?
where does this leave you? every generation goes to new levels. you have andy and novak at 25 hitting the ball harder. where does this leave you now?
where do you think andy's placed now in terms of sunday night?
do you think andy has learned to deal with the setbacks when they come his way?
would you say tonight was your level being a little bit down or was it andy's level being further up compared to other matches you played with him?
how much did the match against tsonga take out of you? how were you feeling coming in?
very tough night. with the way novak was playing tonight, did you feel a little helpless on the court?
this is the best you've seen him play before?
how much did your match against almagro take out of you for tonight?
do you think novak will be the favorite to win the final now?
how frustrating is it to get to the semifinals and not be able to move on one more match to the final? it's happened a few times at the grand slams now.
you're a great friend of rafael nadal. do you seem satisfied that he's going to be back in february, and will you play davis cup against canada?
what is the secret that you have such a great bunch of friends in the spanish team?
what does a performance like that do for your confidence going into sunday night?
do you see your preparation for the final this year being a little bit different compared to last year? do you prefer this?
would you like to see tomorrow night be a long, drawnout match?
will you watch that game tomorrow night on tv as a tennis fan or mentally making notes?
when you're watching it, if somebody hits a brilliant winner down the line, do you go, whoa, great shot?
who would you rather play?
what kind of treatment did you give leconte?
in all seriousness, did you watch the women's semifinal today between victoria and sloane?
there was quite a controversy about a medical treatment late in the second set.
if you were to play andy, would you take any confidence in the fact that after the us open final you got a couple of wins against him at the end of last year? would that be a boost?
when you go into a match against those guys, is it a different feeling going in mentally knowing you might have to be out there five hours?
do you make use of anything like that pressurized egg chamber which you were known to use at the us open? do you have one of them out here in australia at all?
you seemed to get stronger as that match went on. was that your feeling?
is it a relief for you to have that run of games at the end, to hit that sort of form going into the semifinals?
where do you stand on the idea that you could be undercooked going into the semifinal because you've only played threeset matches so far?
it seems more than likely, assuming federer wins, it will be the top four seeds again.
three of the top four are in the semis already. seems like that's happened with pretty good regularity on the atp. do you have any sense of why it happens on the men's tour but not on the women's tour?
i think you're heading out to hisense tonight for a hit. is that as much for the lights?
going into the semis, do you feel different from last year after what you've achieved mentally?
there's been a lot of talk about the scheduling. does it concern you that you haven't played a night match on laver yet?
ivan lendl was invited to watch the davis cup final in prague. did you watch the match?
how pleased were you with your reaction, especially at the start of the fifth set?
how is your body feeling after that much tennis?
have you been working specifically on defense?
how much will the wimbledon and olympic finals matter coming into this game?
you had a lot of rivalries with a lot of players. what makes the matchup with murray stand out for you?
i know you would like to win in three sets, but you expressed this sort of gratitude, if that's not too strong a word, for being part of a match like this. is that the sense you have?
you never lost to andy in a grand slam match.
he made you cry at the last two grand slams.
you say murray has a more offensive style now. does that, in fact, play to your advantage in a way, because in the past when he was more of a defensive counterattacking player, he was often very effective against you.
given who you've beaten here, who you have to beat to win, can you remember as difficult a run in terms of players?
is it any different not having rafa in the draw, not going deep into a tournament such as this?
you said you haven't played a match like today's for some while. is it an advantage that andy murray hasn't gone beyond three sets yet in this tournament?
the top four seeds once again made it to the semifinals in the men's tour. why do you think that is? secondly, it almost never happens on the women's side. a few thoughts why they're so different.
we're talking about advantages. do you think it's an advantage to have played four in a row at night, whereas murray has played none?
you said it's a transition for you before the tournament. have you surprised yourself with the level you've played at?
how much of this is work for you and how much can you really enjoy?
djokovic said after the long game last time he had to go to sleep like 5 a.m. and had an ice bath. i want to know what will you do tomorrow? you will go to sleep very late and also get up very late, skip the breakfast or something like that.
the opinion was that you played very well in that match. would you agree?
when he served for the match the first time at 53, what were you thinking, that he was playing too good?
what was it in the first two sets? you never lost to him in 12 times, but suddenly he was winning.
he served for the match another two or three times. did you feel he was going to get nervous at that time? wasn't he serving well enough to hold?
you've had some great comebacks before. where do you put this one?
you know djokovic very well clearly. he may not ge through. talk about playing berdych or maybe novak who you have seen many times.
did you watch his match against wawrinka?
did you see that there were possibilities for every player to beat him?
you know nico very well. you played davis cup with him. is there a time you can feel sad for him after the match or during the match because it would have been his first semifinal at a grand slam?
tomas just said he thinks your the fittest player on the tour at the moment. do you feel like that?
gilles simon played four hours and could barely move against andy.
what is that routine?
do you know what other people do?
do you feel you do more recovery than other players do?
you can't go into specifics, but has there been a bit of trial and error in how you have come up with the routine?
in the early part of your career you had a reputation for pulling out of matches because of injury. in retrospect, were we unfair to you or was there a point where you felt you had to be fitter?
as a sportsfan, could you understand how it could be surprising for people to see?
if you had not gone gluten free do you think you'd be able to do what you're doing?
what can you do to keep david from keeping you out on the court for four or five hours?
did you see the match today?
what gives you more pure pleasure, a clean winner or making an impossible get on defense and getting the ball back in play?
you hear this question every slam. it's going to be you and ferrer, who is the no.5 player. roger and murray are still in there. are you surprised that some of the other guys outside of that group can't break through at the majors?
to someone who is 25, does 30 or 31 seem very old?
you started very quickly tonight. would you have had any concerns at all if you would have had to go four or five hours tonight?
on the other side of the draw, andy has been scheduled in the day, which means if he wins, his first night match would be the semi. do you think that would be any disadvantage?
is it difficult playing in the twilight when you're losing the daylight?
it seemed like the second set was obviously a lot better for you than the other three. what do you think made the difference in that one?
is your back bothering you again?
after last year, you no doubt were prepared for novak to be in pretty decent physical shape, but were you surprised how well he physically bounced back from that very long match that he had less than two days ago?
all players say he's the fittest. but how different is that from the beginning of his career?
did he not allow you to play your game?
stepanek said if you want to beat novak djokovic at a grand slam, you need to play special. do you think you played an extra special game tonight?
yes.
was it 100% or 110%?
in four sets.
djokovic.
what is your schedule before indian wells?
it's march.
are you still going to play as much davis cup?
is novak going to win this, in your opinion?
you would probably make more money if you did betting.
davis cup was a huge success for the czech republic. do you think playing against switzerland, away match, without roger federer, will that be a bit of an advantage for you or not?
the leg obviously is giving you a fair bit of grief. what's wrong with it?
so you tore something rather than cramped?
you tore the adductor?
take us back to the three opportunities to serve for the match. how frustrating was that to have that chance and not get it done?
the career record now against ferrer, is that really starting to bother you?
was this the closest today?
you said you did the injury in the first set. was it hard to get out of your head in the second and third sets?
did you suffer a separate injury in the tiebreak?
until 54 in the third set, your average speed on the first serve was 200 kilometer per hour. you were basically perfect with the service, forehand, backhand. what happened mentally next?
how much of saturday night's match played a part in tonight's result, the fatigue?
was there any point where you thought you might not turn up on court or pull out during the match?
how do you think he's playing?
what did you have to do in the last 24 hours to be able to play this match?
what percent do you think you were at today?
he's playing jeremy chardy in the next round. do you think there's a chance of an upset there?
what can you say about the match?
how does it compare with the other three times?
when you say you made the most with what you had, does that mean you didn't have everything you usually had?
struggling physically from the fever?
how did it feel to you in the match?
what was the final diagnosis?
whereabouts in the foot?
has it been there during the tournament?
how does it feel now?
left or right?
didn't seem to affect your serve too much. you served pretty well.
this shouldn't affect next week's davis cup for you?
how do you reflect on your performance tonight, unfortunate and difficult circumstances?
before when you came out 110% because you didn't know how it would affect you, what was it like when you were out there tonight?
during your match, the commentators said you are canadian but you could have been australian. it was a matter of papers.
did you really want to play just to get a chance to play on rod laver, center court at a grand slam?
what is your opinion to improve your game? what should you concentrate on in the future?
very strong night for you serving. how did you feel on that especially?
very few unforced errors. how did you feel you were hitting the ball?
two young players in a row. very different games. how do you compare their levels?
how far away do you feel you are from your absolute best form from four or five years ago?
if you had to pick one match so far in your career where you felt you played your best tennis, could you do that?
when djokovic came out against harrison, he seemed to be proving a point. do you have the same kind of extra motivation to put them in their place, perhaps?
you said you stayed up to watch the djokovic match last night. do you think that was a good idea because it finished late? take us through your thoughts as you were watching.
obviously with the challenges, you got some of them right. were you lucky? have you been eating carrots?
sometimes people say when you're playing games with the ball kids, you're obviously sort of getting up to a little bit of...
jerzy janowicz has broken into the top 30. what do you think about his tennis skills?
can you reflect at all on the 35 straight grand slam quarterfinals.
regarding big muscles, we saw djokovic ripping his shirt. what goes through your mind when you see a guy do this? could you do this?
you're the only guy going into the quarterfinals at the moment who hasn't dropped a service game. any thoughts on that?
the history of tennis, i think you are the first jeremy. how come? is the name of your family?
yes.
did you have other jeremys in the family?
do you have sometimes someone that suggests what you do in the court because you looked inspired against my poor italian on the court.
first grand slam quarterfinal. must be pretty happy with what you've achieved so far.
so it's come as a surprise to you?
in the second set, there was a moment that you changed. you were playing twohanded backhand, then suddenly you started to play with the slice. after that, you became in a better position.
if andy murray wins the next match, you beat him in cincinnati, what do you remember about that match and can you use it?
do you think it will be harder in a bestoffive?
your first quarterfinal in a grand slam. how does it feel?
you said you were nervous today. a bigger game next. will you be able to control your nerves?
there's so many exceptional french players. the focus is so much on tsonga, on gasquet. perhaps you want to have a breakthrough result, but you have to keep your career going without any real great publicity. now it's your moment in the lights.
did you always believe this would happen for you? were you always confident that one day your talent would be good enough to reach a grand slam?
can you talk about your knee a little bit. in the first set you actually took off some of the tape.
have they told you what is wrong with it?
when you beat andy in cincinnati, what did you do well that day?
could you tell us how important the academy and patrick have been to your career.
before the season started, you were in mauritius.
was there much interaction between you and serena?
did you play a set with her?
a lot of players have a hard time coming back after pulling off an upset like you did against juan martin. how were you able to keep your calm to get the job done today?
how disheartening or how hard is it when you were playing as well as you were particularly early in the match and he's still winning all the games?
seemed like you had to work more than others do.
how deep do you think he can go in this tournament?
were you bothered by the knee today?
you started playing against these guys, so how do you view ferrer? as among the very best? how do you see him? as one of the very best?
you said that you're quite keen to emulate some of the aspects of his game. what sort of lessons do you take away from what was on court today?
do you find that coming up against a guy that that you want to emulate, that you want to look up to, is more rewarding than coming up against any normal player?
you had a tough time in matches against top 10 players. do you think there is a big difference in the level where you are and the level where they are?
what do you think of your chances in the other grand slams this year? can you go to the quarterfinals and do better?
did you follow kimiko? did you watch any of her matches? what do you think of her play here in australia?
did you watch her when you were younger, when you were coming up?
what's the difference between today's match and last year at the olympics?
the key of the match should be the beginning of the first set. you saved a couple of very important points.
where has your tennis improved?
your coach says that within the game, you know the game better, you follow the score better. what does he mean?
you're consistently getting to this stage of grand slam tournaments. what do you need to do to progress even further?
you are in the top four rankingwise.
do you feel you're in that group?
it's midway through a grand slam. can you tell us mentally and physically what's the difference between the first week and second week of a slam.
kei told us he can learn a lot of things from you, especially defense. if you could give him some advice, what would you give?
yes.
specifically what kind of aspect do you think he needs to improve?
you say you still think the top four are better. isn't it important for you to believe that you are as good as them?
you've been involved in some pretty dramatic matches, here especially. where does that one rank, and how pleased are you to come out of it alive?
you changed your shoes after the first set. did that make a big difference?
how much do you think all those matches you've won like this in recent years helped you out in the fifth set like that?
when you ripped your shirt off, can you describe the emotion?
had you always suspected stan had this quality in him?
how tired were you? were you more tired tonight than last year in the final?
men's tennis has generated such a level of interest. the reactions to it straightaway and during were incredible. it's almost, can we get any better.
andy told us he heard after that semifinal last year you woke up at 3:00 the next afternoon.
do you think it will be the same tomorrow?
red wine.
that was one heck of a tiebreak.
were you consciously really going for it in the tiebreak?
is it easier said than done? those tiebreakers, there's a lot of pressure. to really go for it, it makes sense to be slightly passive. is that the difference between the top four in those situations and everyone else?
would you say you're mentally strong?
how do you feel this year compared to last year going into the quarterfinals, probably playing another big player?
i think it was a backhand volley for two sets to love against rafa. could you have done anything differently with that shot?
you say you learnt a lot in the last year. anything specific or in particular that you've discovered about yourself?
is that davis cup final still in your head? do you still think about it a lot?
did you see the match last night between federer and tomic?
could you sense that your opponent was injured out there today from the beginning?
and did that play on your mind at all or were you just focused on what you needed to do?
looking forward to your next match against ferrer. you've met 12 times. you haven't been able to get past him. what are your thoughts on that matchup?
is there anything to change in your game maybe?
it's unfortunate what happened to tipsarevic. going into the second round, having such a short game, will that help you in the quarterfinals?
what did you learn?
that tiebreak, was that some of the best tennis you played?
there was a point in the tiebreak where you challenged the call. was that designed to get up his nose? did you want to have a breath?
what do you take from the whole summer?
even more belief you can compete with these big boys?
despite the loss, i suppose you want to get back to play as soon as you can. what's your next tournament?
a couple players during the tournament have made comments about more senior players like kei nishikori said david ferrer and ryan harrison said novak djokovic, people they want to emulate. roger has been a childhood hero of yours. is he the benchmark of your game, for example?
the choice of serving first, did you get the choice?
not a great start. were there a few nerves, a bit tight?
how different was your mindset going in to face roger tonight compared with last year?
did he say anything in particular to you after the game at the net?
compare this to the previous meeting.
something sharp on your pillow, bernie?
you barely lost a match in australia the last couple of years. how do you sustain that form when you go overseas, like what roger tried to challenge you to do last year?
did you catch sara's match this afternoon?
the service return to go back up to the mini break in the first set was a gutsy shot and obviously worked out.
you have to consider that a big win for you.
how much of it today was mental and how much was physical/technical to pull through?
so you're sick?
so did you feel weak coming on the court tonight?
where do you feel you sort of got him being negative and you got on top of him? when did you realize it really happened?
the net cord, you're unbeaten there, pretty comfortable there?
were there times last night when you were getting up thinking, no way i'm going to get on court and beat this guy?
if you'd been hot, i mean, you've played late in the afternoon it was cooler, do you think that was an advantage?
did you get a chance to watch any of what's going on out there now?
pretty impressive?
bernard...
your intensity level two nights from now is going to have to be super high to get in there against federer.
you're feeling good after getting through that?
it could be an afternoon match. how do you feel about that?
what do you think you might bring to this match you weren't able to bring to the other ones?
can you describe the transformation? obviously wasn't too good in brisbane, kooyong a bit goofy, but this transformation from when you got here to the way you are playing now?
watching some of bernie's match, winning the big points against federer seems to be important.
your game is so much different than the guys he's played so far. you have to think that's an advantage. he hasn't played a guy that serves as well as you. the pressure of returning and stuff.
the rod laver experience from last year. better a second time?
i can't figure out whether you had a haircut since kooyong.
gave you a good test.
was it an advantage practicing with him, that you know his game so well?
good situation to be in going forward? you've had a decent match today, but you must be very optimistic about what lies ahead of you.
after the match you mentioned you hadn't been hitting the ball as well as you'd like in practice. when that's happening, how can you get your form back? is it something that just comes back, or is there something you can do to rediscover it?
have you been doing all the practicing here onsite? somebody said they saw ivan at kooyong the other day.
are those court conditions, the pace...
roger talked about the yearend championships, maybe he'd like to see the courts speeding up in general on the tour. maybe the fans would like to see more volleying. what are your thoughts as a fan and a player on the courts?
you enjoy going forward personally?
just on your game, what is frustrating you most?
you talked about being encouraging of more blood testing in tennis. after seeing the armstrong interview, have your views on that evolved further?
when novak was here yesterday he said he'd only been bloodtested once in the last six or seven months. can you tell us how much you've been bloodtested over the past 12 months.
are they all out of competition?
was del potro's defeat today a bit of a surprise to you?
for a while it looked like you were holding your shoulder. is that all okay?
how did you find that match for yourself?
what can you say about your opponent? is he a player to watch in the future?
how close do you think the match was for you? you had all the right answers at the right times. how close to the perfect match was it for you?
certain shots or points that surprised even you?
by yourself?
has he improved since you played him last?
he's raised eyebrows about what he thinks his potential is. how important do you think it is for a tennis player to be humble at his stage?
he says you always had encouraging words for him. why do you do that?
are you seeing some results from your little pep talk?
are you seeing it now?
raonic next.
we've been asking some of the other players about their impression of lance armstrong. love to get your impressions as well.
have you ever met him?
back to tennis.
can you perhaps talk a little bit about luke and what he's been doing for you in practice?
what was deciding today in your favor for the match?
is that your biggest success so far?
how does it feel?
you played terrific in the first and second sets. in the third set when you lost the tiebreak, you said you stayed calm. did you feel maybe he was going to come back into the game?
what was your tactic today?
were you worried in the third and fourth sets he would be more confident for the fifth set?
french players are becoming the story of this tournament. there's guaranteed to be four in the fourth round now. is there any secret as to why french tennis is going so well at the moment?
do you think one of the french players can go farther now and maybe even win?
i don't know.
is it maybe for you easier to play not in front to have such a success compared to if you are playing in roland garros?
you had a medical timeout for your ankle. is it okay?
you play either ferrer or baghdatis next. you have a winning record against ferrer but a losing record against marcos. your thoughts on either?
nice to get revenge?
there's a few japanese players doing well this year. is there a lot of excitement back home?
how did you feel your level of performance was today, especially at a point in time in the tournament where you want to be building?
you have kei nishikori next. what do you have to do to beat him this time?
you've played in the olympics last time, and the first time he beat you. what kind of shots are uncomfortable for you?
do you feel like you're playing your best tennis at the moment?
it's promising that you're building through the tournament.
are you confident within yourself about how you're feeling?
it's a satisfying win against a difficult opponent. you played some good tennis.
some players say center court feels slower than other years.
some players say this surface is faster than last year. do you feel that way?
do you feel more pressure being the top spaniard without rafa here?
have you been in contact with him?
is it fair to say that was your toughest match so far?
we did an interview with radek and he said the only way to beat you is to play the game that you play, come to the net, to change the pace.
it was a serious match, a real tennis match; there was some theater, exhibition.
radek was talking about one of the big sports stories of the day is lance armstrong admitting he used steroids. the interview was happening during your match and he wanted to se it.
is that the kind of thing you'd definitely want to see for yourself?
how comfortable are you that drug testing in tennis is rigorous enough?
how about blood testing? the itf records tell us in the whole of 2011 there was only 18 blood tests taken of the top players. how often would you or andy or roger or rafa be blood tested?
would you disagree with darren cahill who said today that he believes the antidoping program in tennis is inadequate and it's been going backwards in recent years?
that's his opinion.
i think part of the issue is outofcompetition blood testing is expensive to carry out. do you think the itf should make it more of a priority to spend more money on that?
a lot of cycling fans have lost a lot of faith in that sport now. do you think tennis fans should be confidant that nothing like this...
do you think tennis fans should have faith that that won't happen the same way?
would you be in favor of like a biological passport program that they're instituting in cycling for tennis?
i think the highest ranked teenagers are ranked 200 something for the men. does that show how physical it is and how much maturity it takes for the guys to come through?
the lance armstrong interview today, i was wondering what your thoughts are on drug testing in tennis?
my question is what about the authorities in tennis are doing.
must be happy to seal the win eventually.
was it a bit harder than you expected?
that breakpoint you did win, it shows a bit about how much you improved in your movement.
how did you find the conditions out there today? another set, was there much in the tank?
there were times you couldn't get a point off him on serve. what was the key behind turning that around?
when you get up to the fifth or sixth match point, what was going through your head?
how much do you think it took out of you, bernie?
you served over 20 aces yourself. how much of a comfort is it to know you can rely on that?
you said in your last press conference you were going to look at youtube to find out about your opponent. did you find out much?
what did it tell you?
what was going through your mind when he was clawing back those match points?
what is your plan for tonight? sit and watch the match?
you won't have to go to youtube to get roger's highlights. if it is him, how do you feel about the matchup?
do you think you can find the right attitude going into that match?
how do you look back on that match last year in the fourth round now?
the serve is a key. what will you do differently to last year?
yes.
how much better are you serving than 12 months ago or even four months ago?
what do you see as being the key factors in the past couple weeks' performance?
who did you sit down with?
you sat down and thought you needed to change?
were you worried it was slipping away what you always thought was your destiny, a doubt it may not occur?
was there anything anyone said to you that was part of the equation?
give us an insight into the atmosphere on court. distractions in the crowd. did you enjoy that sort of thing? did that lift you up?
you're the only australian person left in the singles draw now. does that come with extra pressure? do you have any thoughts about that?
i know you had some ups and downs, with davis cup and stuff like that. do you feel like everything is forgiven and forgotten, things are on the up and up, or do you still feel you have things to prove to people here?
when you had this conversation with yourself last year, did you get an idea of why things were going a little off the rails?
was there one particular day that you can recall?
have to feel pretty good after that.
is it sometimes harder to play a match like that because you'd be conserving energy?
can you remember playing in tougher conditions anywhere?
does heat pale with insignificance compared to the wind like the match you played against berdych at the us open?
what do you think about davydenko/federer tonight?
yes.
do you like meeting successful sports stars? i'm wondering what you think of the appointment of gordon strachan in scottish football?
you hit with berankis in brisbane?
he's obviously won four matches in a row now. is that something you think about?
is it fun having the british women like watson and robson around?
you talked earlier about your new shirt, how it's tighter than the previous years. was that a conscious decision, to change your style on the court?
when it's extremely hot out, like today, is it more comfortable in that shirt or is it more comfortable in the old baggy ones?
on a fashion note, to be silly, robredo and berdych seem to be wearing shorter shorts. it's like from the '70s. would you ever see yourself in those type of shorts?
one of the most unusual gifts you were given after wimbledon, the cow juliette. how's she doing now?
can you talk about your match coming up with bernard tomic. how much of a different player do you think he is from the last time you played him?
is there any area in particular that you think he's improved to have the current winning streak?
when you have a headtohead that goes back 10 years with a player, do you become conscious of things you can do now that you couldn't do 10 years ago?
or against other players.
do you feel stronger now?
other players talk about the video preparation they do before an opponent comes along. what sort of video preparation do you do?
bernard has been a little bit of a divisive character in australia; whereas you've always had support on rod laver in australia. does that help you going into a match against the last australian in the draw?
do you hope to intimidate with your aura to young boys when they come through?
you said out on the court that physically you felt you could have more of an advantage over him. how do you use that? sort of move him around the court, your power of shot?
to the previous point about players being ready to play big players, i looked back at tomic's prematch interview last year and he sounded like a kid totally in fear. this year he's playing mind games in the media, saying davydenko might beat him. that's perhaps him thinking he's a peer of yours now. is there a danger of him getting ahead of himself?
he said his serve has changed, that it was so much better. does that make it harder to break him?
have you ever experienced anything like that in terms of physically what was happening towards the end of that fifth set to your body?
it looked beyond what most of us know as cramp. explain what was happening.
what is the mindset when that happens? are you just trying to hang in there?
what is the primary emotion for you here? pride that you were able to hang in there? disappointment? what is it?
how frustrating is it when you've been out there so long, you're so close, you're right there, and your legs aren't doing what you want them to do?
do you know physically how many kilos you lost?
regarding the fifth set, what do you have to do?
he looked like he was feeling as badly as you were physically. neither of you were going to give it up. just his approach, what did you make of it?
you half expect someone is going to sort of throw in the towel, perhaps not voluntarily. you just refused to leave that court.
about the weather, how hot was it out there?
can you share your plan for the year, where you're at, what you want to achieve for the year now that this is over?
would you like to play more grand slams this year?
do you think you've got the aussie fans on your side? do you think they're excited to see where you might go this year?
just after the match, have you been on an iv drip between now and then?
went to the bike?
if you made it over the lines, do you think you would have been in fair shape to play on saturday?
have you had a chance to talk to brian since he got...
do you know what happened?
he's had a rough time, hasn't he?
what was he exactly saying to you when you were sitting down? he was taking his shaking his head and talking to the trainer and the doctor.
he had been playing pretty well up to that point, right?
still don't know what the injury is, but do you worry at all that like a serious injury could send him into a sort of virtual retirement?
i don't know if you really knew him at all before last year, but can you talk about just what his return presence has added to the american team, if you can call it that.
have you ever played against someone or seen someone tear an acl on a tennis court?
moving ahead, wawrinka, the last time you played him it was a pretty long fivesetter at the open. do you remember that?
just talk a bit about him.
you're feeling overall the courts are playing super fast?
faster than ever?
faster than the us open?
even ashe?
so you're happy about that, i would guess.
will you check in with brian again later today?
you said you're a much better player than 2010. fitnesswise, if you get into five sets against stan, do you feel like you're fitter?
yeah.
percentagewise how much more of that recovery type of work are you doing now than, say, two or three years ago?
boot things?
so acupuncture. how long have you been doing that and how frequently do you do it?
you feel it works?
how was that? how did you feel out there today?
how is the knee?
so there's no more problems? it's getting better?
how did you feel out there on showcourt 3? there was a big crowd out there for one of the outside courts. do you enjoy that sort of an atmosphere?
you made history here last year: first japanese men in the modern era to reach the quarters of a grand slam. you have had a straightsets win today. do you feel the momentum coming along the way you want it to? you're happy with your form?
you'll probably play youzhny in your next match. you've never played him before. what are your thoughts?
at 5all you sat down two aces. i'm not sure if you remember. one was 145 kilometers an hour; one was 159 kilometers an hour. is it the placement of serve that you have to rely on a lot more given your size?
you hit two aces. one was a second serve at 145 kilometers and hour, and second one was a 159. was it more the placement you aim for?
we see that there is a lot of support for you, very vocal, a lot of japanese in the crowd here really encouraging you. what's that like to have sort of that home support, in a way, at the australian open?
so is it feeling like your home grand slam?
we saw another two male players from japan making second round in the tournament. what do you attribute to that rise? what's going on in japan to make that happen this year?
we also learned that the pan pacific tournament in tokyo may be relocated in the next years, so do you have any concerns that's gonna be an effect to this rise?
do you have any concern about the relocation about the pan pacific tournament next year?
speaking of japanese players, what do you think of kimiko's win yesterday?
you obviously learned a lot last year in your tennis. what did you learn today?
have you come back down 2love before?
is this a better win than the win against gulbis in wimbledon?
what exactly frustrated you out there on court?
do you have any regrets about the things you did on the court in terms of when you went nuts?
what exactly did you do to calm yourself down and come back to win that match?
have you gone as nuts as that in a match before?
have you hit the umpire's chair before?
do you expect to get in trouble for that?
what about at the end? you were very animated. somebody gave you flowers. has that ever happened before?
you haven't played this tournament before. was it a question of not having the financial resources to get to australia in the past?
where were you this time last year?
quite a big change from last year to this.
you said it was a money thing. how much money did you make the previous year, or not make?
in 2011.
but not enough that you could afford to come here.
all of a sudden you are making money and have sponsors. has this changed you, your life?
did you enjoy playing out there on court today? what was your experience with the australian crowd?
did you surprise yourself? given what happened at the end of the first set and then you lost the second quite easily, it looked like you were gone.
you play nicolas almagro next. do you know much about him? what are your thoughts?
since bercy, have you felt sometimes the media attention was too much around you?
what is the strangest thing you read about yourself since bercy?
just too good tonight?
how is the court playing?
how does the match compare to the previous two?
you sound like once you got broken in your first service game you were playing catchup the whole time after that.
he's such a great returner. do you see ways it could work? how complicated a task is it?
is this a tough loss or is it easy?
do you see this as a good gauge to where your game is or more he came out blazing today?
i thought you were creating more opportunities to keep the ball low on him. just too hard to do off those kind of balls?
have you been watching a lot of tape of djokovic or other top guys you mentioned?
do you think it takes some draws that give you more of a head start into the tournament? you hit a bunch of walls early here.
did you get a chance to see what happened to brian today?
three to four months out.
has it been strange to have no roddick around here?
is that one of the best grand slam matches you've played?
did you want to send some sort of statement who is a young sort of rising star of the tennis world, as well?
with your performance tonight were you trying to send a message to him?
he's talked openly about wanting to win grand slams and be no.1. he's been around the tour for a few years and hasn't yet made the third round of a grand slam. do you think those sort of high heights are in the future? you've played him a few times now.
just playing the way you played tonight, is that important? does that help you for the later stages of the tournament?
how did it feel to make history as the first male player in main draw? did you feel any extra pressure because of this?
did you enjoy the support out there on the court?
were you happy with the way you played today?
will you take confidence from winning a set against someone ranked more than 100 places above you?
did li na provide any advice before the match today?
have you set your target on qualifying for roland garros next? is that on the agenda?
what has your new coach been helping you with specifically, and how important has he been to your game?
no, in general.
your coach is french, right?
to follow this question, could you talk a little bit about him and about your relationship with him? are you very close with your coach?
that seemed really impressive from the start. did it feel that way to you?
what did you make of the singing fans that supported you?
are they australians?
do you know anything about your next opponent, sousa?
physically are you exactly where you want to be bodywise? not so much fitness, but you seem to fill your shirt out perhaps even more than you did 12 months ago.
but are you where you want to be physically?
is there a bit of relief about getting the first game of the season at this open out of the way?
do you even feel nerves with your success?
did it feel noticeably different walking out as a major winner?
is it tricky that everyone is understandably looking to the last major and all you want to do is look forward?
i think the forecast is for about 39 degrees on thursday. does that make you more concerned about where you are in the schedule at all, what time of day you play?
did you check in which half of the draw janowicz is in?
there has been so sad news today about brad drewett, the atp world tour chairman stepping down. do you have a message for brad?
were you happy with that performance? did you always feel in control out there?
they're forecasting 90 degrees for your next match. how is the heat going to effect yourself?
he said he couldn't read your game at all. do you know you have that effect on your opponent and are you aware of it in a match that guys maybe don't anticipate at all?
you're facing sela or davydenko in the next round. what are your thoughts about him?
will you be watching bernard tomic's match tonight?
is this the longest break you have had between official matches that you can recall? did that make you more eager to get out there?
in cycling, with lance winning on the tour, do you have any thoughts on i guess reports that he's admitted that he doped to oprah?
lance armstrong has apparently admitted to oprah that he has doped. i'm wondering if you watched any cycling or if you have any thoughts?
i know you have put out a statement. would you like to say something about brad drewett?
you have been in argentina lately. what do you think about the experience that you have there?
it looked like you really had to dig deep for that one.
any mixed emotions playing an aussie?
i guess at least australia had a winner at least.
any chance of that happening, you think?
you know each other's games so well; was that a struggle?
i think the crowd started singing advance australia fair towards the end of the match today. was that important to have the crowd on you?
what did your coach say after the match?
must have been hard for him sitting there between you two.
how long is your longest match in your career?
so at least by an hour long this is longer than you played before?
how did you react physically?
can you explain what it feels like when you finally get there at the end of fourandahalf hours to get there? because it was a seesawing battle the whole way through.
i understand you guys are staying at the same hotel and have been eating meals together. are you going to eat together tonight?
is that the greatest satisfaction you have had in a match, probably the biggest match you have played given the crowd and the support there?
obviously since he walked off the court, have you two caught up?
on paper it opens up things a little bit more for you; is that how you see it?
it's going to be pretty hot on thursday; how will you handle that?
is it a unique feeling when the crowds start quacking?
pat rafter was out watching. is it part of their sort of davis cup audition? would you like to get a gig in the next month?
do you get any privileges? like sharing a room with luke saville, do you get biggest bed now or...
you came up with some pretty big shots at very important moments in the match tonight. 3love down in the second...
when the draw was made, was it one of those, i wish this didn't happen to me?
he said he thought it was the best you could play. did you feel the same way?
is he still one of the best scramblers that we've seen in tennis?
what is the meaning of the tattoo on your right arm?
yes.
chinese or japanese?
what time did you make it?
how many tattoos on your arm?
do you have any regret?
can you talk about your knee, how the knee feels now? are you completely...
no problems?
but you did have a problem earlier this year?
you had a great tournament last year here. do you feel any pressure coming in this year to repeat your results or do better?
i'm not sure if you have noticed there will be a chinese male player who is going to play in the main draw grand slam event tomorrow. do you also recall a little bit about your first time major men's draw experience? was it in wimbledon in 2008?
us open?
what was it like then? how did you do at that time? did you feel the pressure, all the expectation from local media?
you had a lot of japanese support out there. does this feel like your home grand slam tournament?
i think we could tell by your reaction afterwards, that was a hard one for you to swallow. give us your impressions of how it went for you.
what did you think of your own level?
do nights and occasions like this still keep you eager?
to play attacking tennis seemed to be your game plan.
from the double break in the second set, to what degree did you drop a little bit or did he come up with stuff?
may be a little bit of an irrelevance, but were you unhappy when he delayed on a couple of challenges?
do you feel you gave everything you had during the match?
is he an underrated player, do you think?
you think he rose to the occasion a bit tonight?
he's 27, 28. why do you think he's taken that long to get to the top 10?
what did your level today leave you feeling for the rest of the season?
are you a fan of extreme sports?
could you share something about one of the chinese male players wu di who you played against in davis cup two years ago?
he told the chinese media you're one of his favorite players because he's not as tall as some of the other players. can you share some experience on how to be aggressive as a nottootall player on court?
that certainly wouldn't have been fun the way it ended?
no, last year and this year again to go out the same way.
you had a low conversion of breakpoints. is that where you need to improve?
is that focus on fitness, you and peter, more peter?
peter was talking top 30, top 50 by the end of the year. you say how you feel complete. do you feel that's realistic with how you're playing?
did you say anything to peter about the match point?
is a big weapon what you need, matt?
that was a very convincing win today. are you happy with your performance out on rod laver?
how do you feel about your own game? do you feel you're right on top of everything?
can you give us an idea what sort of physical preparations you do in the offseason?
roughly how many hours would you change in a day?
in the time since you won that match, have you thought about round two yet and who you might face up yet?
are you conscious on the physical preparation side of what your rivals are doing? do you know the details of what andy murray, for instance, is doing?
has it become a competition within the competition? this guy is doing this much, i have to do this much?
talking about the possible aussie open hat trick, what do such historical achievements mean to you?
what were the conditions like playing on rod laver today?
did the new racquet fair well?
when you came on tour, how much talk did you hear with recovery and how much of that is a part of your overall preparation now versus when you came on tour?
what did you write on the camera lens?
how was that for your first match?
is it at all difficult for you when everybody always talks about the very, very top few players; no one talks about you, david ferrer, jowilfried fred tsonga. how do you go into a tournament, thinking i can win this?
do you ever sort of go into a grand slam thinking, something really strange has to happen for me to have a chance to win, or is it just about how well you can play yourself?
you were very close in new york to making that final.
at the us open we saw rafael nadal positioning himself on the court like he never did before against any other opponent. he seemed to have found a solution to play you. what did you do to counter that adaptation that he showed in the us open, and a comment on this final as well.
22 matches now. compared to other kind of golden spells in your career, how sort of high does this rank? how does it set you up for australia in the new year?
you just mentioned the davis cup. you had some mixed reaction from the crowd through your matches. sometimes they supported your opponent loudly. you thanked them after this match for their passion. can you talk about how you feel about the crowd and also how you feel about going home soon and playing before the crowd in serbia in a few days?
we've seen you coming to the net a lot more this season. it served you well tonight. how important is it to have this extra dimension, especially against rafa?
can you tell us what you will be doing between the davis cup final and the new season. in particular, are you playing any exhibitions?
if you had to choose, what would you prefer to win, roland garros or reach no.1 next year?
losing the no.1 ranking, is winning the title compensation for that, or are they just two entirely different things?
how do you feel about completing a hat trick of titles here?
altogether.
how much of an advantage for you this time will it be, the transition to davis cup, the fact that you won't have to be switching from a hard court surface to clay? is there any chance you'll fly back to belgrade on a plane with your name on it?
after the final last year you told us considering what you went through in the year of 2012, it was more satisfying than 2011. at this moment can you tell us how satisfying the year of 2013 is for you.
do you ever watch any of the replays of some of the amazing shots that you get back and actually wince and wonder how you do it?
is it more satisfying to be in the final of a masters or to beat federer for the first time on an indoor surface? do you think today federer played well, not well, you played very well?
yet another final for you here in london. is it fair to say you're getting used to this surface? are you going to be 100% for tomorrow? can you think about the final you played with roger a few years back to now?
how much would it mean to you to end your year by winning for the first time ever the world tour finals?
people talk about roger as the greatest player in history. but you've beaten him 22 times out of 32 matches. you're five years younger than him, and you're only four grand slams short of him. i know you're a very modest person. when you hear people talking about roger as the greatest of all time, do you ever sometimes just think, maybe people should be talking about me like that?
you played roger many times in your career. what do you feel he struggles with in his game compared to perhaps five years ago?
you said he was playing crazy today and going for winners almost on every shot.
why do you think that is? is that the first time he was going for shots in every moment in all the times you played him?
tennis is always changing and evolving and improving. this season again we've seen the same group of players winning all the big tournaments, all the masters tournaments. next year, do you expect to see some of the young guys, maybe 23 and younger, to start pushing you, raonic, dimitrov, janowicz, or do you think they're far away from being able to challenge the top guys?
you've somewhat downplayed your chances this week due to the form of other players coming in and the surface. given the week that you've had, you're going to finish the year at world no.1, you just have beaten the most successful player in this format for the first time, you have a longer rest than the player you play in the final tomorrow, are you convinced yet that you're the favorite for this competition?
you just played wawrinka this past week. you played djokovic quite a bit on hard courts this year. how do you see that match going tonight? do you have a prediction of that match?
do you look at this as completely the end of 2013, you'll forget about this tournament, start with a clean slate, or is there anything from this you'll carry over into the new season?
you said you hoped you'd be able to play with a little bit pressure than usual, an underdog situation. were you able to play in the way you wanted to?
at the beginning of the match your serve was fluid and you had breakpoints. it could have gone another way?
you seem to really hit over on your backhand a lot in the returns, also hit it down the line. do you feel you were hitting it well? was that part of the plan? can you also talk about what it is about nadal that makes it so difficult to slice effectively against him.
i know 2013 is only just finishing. at this stage, if you look at 2014, what would be a satisfactory year for you? would it be one where you didn't have any physical issues? where you improved your ranking? would you still very much feel a grand slam is what makes a satisfactory year for you?
how important is it to you next year going in to have a ranking that going to get you in positions where you might not have to face these top guys early on, playing novak or rafa early on in tournaments? is that important to you? secondly, where do you assess yourself after the last few weeks of the season here?
what have you learnt specifically from this week and how confident are you that you'll be back here again next year?
(no microphone.)
you played rafa 32 times since the start of 2004. do you feel like he's substantially improved since then or do you feel like you have, since you first played him?
just talk about his level of improvement and then your own.
about rafa, do you think he has arrived at the moment when he is going to win this masters cup? if he does it, what does it mean for you winning everything, all four grand slams, olympics, masters cup?
what is it especially about this sport and your love for it that wants you to keep coming back year after year?
clearly the older you get, the harder it is to bounce back from tough matches. you've spoken about that quite a lot. one of the extraordinary things about rafa and novak is this ability they seem to have to bounce back in a very short space of time from a grueling match. from your experience, how much longer will they be able to do that at 26, 27? at what point for a finetuned athlete does this become more of an issue?
are you planning to play next season more tournaments than this year? is there an 18th grand slam title, a chance you might have next year?
the match tomorrow is the best way to end the season, the no.1, the no.2.
you just mentioned ending the season with a title. you almost mentioned in the oncourt interview, you have two big matches coming up this weekend.
talk a little bit about that and how you're feeling about it. you've played every possible match in paris, here. is that ideal preparation? is it too much time on court?
rafa won the tough matches you had in paris and new york. would winning tomorrow in any way make up for that?
next year you and rafa have built a pretty big lead up in the points, and you'll be battling for no.1 the first few months of the season. how important is this match for you tomorrow as far as the subtle shifts in the balance of power we see?
could you talk about what kind of tactics you need to employ and be successful with in order to win tomorrow.
before the tournament started, rafa said you were the favorite. when you heard that, what did you think?
you've heard it now.
can you say again how much the defeats in paris and new york and losing the no.1 slot have hurt you and how, if at all, you've used that as motivation in this winning streak you've had?
at love3 down in the third set, how worried were you? were you thinking your year was perhaps over?
if we would write today that today we saw the best federer of the year 2013, would you agree with that?
when have we seen him?
indoors you are 4love against rafa. you beat him four times, all in the masters cup. you have less than 24 hours to recover. do you have any special strategy for tomorrow's game?
i guess your achievement before starting the tournament would be to win it. to make it to the semifinals is a good goal?
your forehand has been a major weapon for you. seems like the ups and downs you've been having have shown in that shot. is that fair to say?
when the match is tight in places like that, the fact that 17,000 people are mostly cheering for you, do you take energy from that?
tomorrow two swiss men playing, you and wawrinka. could you talk about this moment. historical.
about del potro, a lot of ups and downs during the match. we asked him. he said he doesn't know exactly what is the solution. do you notice it? is there any kind of solution for the ups and downs in the match?
del potro.
coming from you probably. but in general, not just today, you follow him a lot. you play a lot against him.
i know you've been in this situation before. is it slightly odd when you're playing and you know that other people's fate is in your hands, so to speak?
you always seem to find a way to win when it gets tense. you've beaten tomas 16 times in a row now.
16 times in a row. what is it that you do better than they do in the important moments?
who do you prefer to face in the semifinal?
after his match against you the other day, wawrinka in the press conference here said he felt that toni was coaching you throughout the match, that it was too much. was that true? what is your reaction to him saying that?
the second half of this year we haven't talked much about your knees, which is good. are you playing painfree or do you still have pain during matches that you have to manage?
you've been training with philippe earlier in the week. he's left now. how did that affect your preparation for today? what do you think of him as a player?
it's been a fantastic year. could you sum up the match today and then sum up your wonderful year.
you've played both players this week of tonight's match. could you give us your thoughts on the match tonight between rafa and berdych.
we could see how frustrated you were out there, how much you wanted to win. were you thinking about the ranking points or just wanting to finish off your year with a win?
you've had the experience of going from this tournament to davis cup finals, having a quick turnaround. some of the players this year are doing this as well. can you talk about what's needed to make the transition from the world tour finals to the davis cup final?
you've done it in the past, going for next week to the davis cup final. tomas and novak are doing that. is it difficult to do that?
you played seven tournaments in seven weeks. you must be feeling very tired. i wonder if you regret playing so many matches before coming to london.
you have davis cup coming up. do you have any extra motivation?
(no microphone.)
after such a long year working and playing tennis, your game suits this place. the tournament is going to stay. do you think you will have better chances in another year?
obviously your year hasn't quite ended yet. can you just quickly reflect on a pretty good year.
as you just said, you broke the top five this year. have you got any targets for 2014?
how do you like the atmosphere, the fans at the o2? what does it mean to you?
it's strange to see nadal down 50. which was your feeling in that moment?
nadal, 50 down. did you see him down 50 this year?
the score was strange.
it was a great match. it's just towards the end that maybe he raised his level, and it wasn't the same for you. is it hard in a third set? if you had to think back, what would you have done differently at the end?
how have you found the atmosphere on court this week?
you obviously have had a very good season. is there anything you've taken from this week that you can put into your offseason for 2014?
do you notice anything different playing federer now than in previous seasons?
one of the features of the tournament is you get wellknown sports people here, olivier giroud and laurent koscielny. do you get to know these sports people throughout your career?
richard, usually french players are here. tsonga got to a final. do you think they appreciate the work you are doing? roger today said if you don't get to the finals, you are not mentioned. do you think the work of the french players is appreciated all around?
can you tell us about the men's game in france at the moment.
during the match, a graphic went up where you were standing in this match compared to when you beat roger in 2005. you were behind the baseline. did you try to bring the game to him, attack him more?
you are in the semis. what is your opinion about del potro? the second set, you lose your control a little bit or...
you're on a tremendous winning streak right now. talk about how your confidence is right now compared to six months ago? what's the difference?
you've qualified with a match to spare. how do you focus on your final group game?
if i could put you on the spot. you just mentioned both roger and juan martin. having gone three sets in both, beating both of them, who would you expect to see come through for a semifinalist, the two of them go headtohead?
how frustrated are you because you cannot be the no.1 at the end of the year?
you've had some great battles with juan martin this year. would you see him as potentially one of the real rivals next year in terms of grand slam titles?
you're on a streak since the final of the us open. some players lose a grand slam final, you lose wimbledon earlier, you seem to have reacted perfectly. you seem to be motivated by that loss. how hard was it? how did it spike you to do even better?
you were obviously very, very happy at the end of the match today. what was it that pleased you most? was it qualifying for the semifinals? was it securing the world no.1 position? was it the way you played?
last year we were all talking about how much we missed you, how much tennis missed you. you came back in a magnificent way. talk about now nole is chasing you, has a winning run, and the rivalry will take over next season. how is it for you when it's so tight at the top and there are so many good players? does it make you try a little bit extra?
can you remember where you were this time 12 months ago, whether you were watching the tennis, at home relaxing, and what your thoughts were about your future?
at this time last year could you have at all envisaged, ever thought of being in this position? even when you started a comeback, could you even think about being in this sort of a position?
a few words about stan, who played a great game today, but also a fantastic season.
yesterday you were asked for your views on the decision in the troicki case. you mentioned that you feel sorry for viktor. although you were injured, you two have one thing in common, which is being away from competition for a long time. do you have any advice for him about how to make it through a long time away from the tour?
novak said last night that he has lost faith and trust in the antidoping authorities, partly because of the troicki case. he doesn't believe they are accurate enough. what do you think about the whole situation, about what he said?
in your mentality on the court and in life you never give up, you never quit. recently you said with atp politics, you quit, you want no more. i want to know, what is it about the tour politics that makes you want to quit?
you can't change anything?
today's match was really close. how do you explain that when it's close, still it's you who wins in the end? what advice would you give to stan to eventually one day beat you?
you said all year the no.1 ranking was not the most important thing, but then you said today it was for this match. when did you start thinking about that? was it after bercy? was it when you first got here? was it weighing heavily on you?
yes.
now that you've secured the no.1 ranking, if you can now go on and win this tournament, which is the only major title you've never won, how special would that be? where would it rank in terms of grand slams and the olympics?
what was the difference between today, because you played so well, and the loss to david five days ago in paris?
the big match on friday against rafa.
federer mentioned the other day about the tournament remaining here at the o2, whereas novak and rafa want it to move to other cities. what is your opinion?
what changed in three days?
obviously you couldn't be here last year. how did it feel to be back out on the court again?
when you've played someone that much  30 times you've played david  do you pick up new things, new ideas, nuances when you play someone that often, when you know their game that well, or it's pretty much the same thing, you're going to do what you're going to do?
i appreciate there's still a lot of tennis to be played in this tournament. but when you look back on this event, it's an event that you haven't won. so does it make you any more determined this year, especially with the way you've played in the last eight months, nine months, to actually win this tournament this time?
you have to play again in 24 hours against someone who has had an extra day off. how do you think that will factor into the match?
it might sound a bit of a silly question, but what to you is different about playing indoors? does it feel strange? does it feel different?
you said it's a bit slower than in paris. are you happy with that?
today viktor troicki received a reduced ban. he said it ends his dream to become a top player. do you agree with him that it's still too harsh for a missed test?
if you could give us your thoughts on today's match.
rafa said he had to start very strong against you. he feels like you press a lot more. do you feel you didn't really play your game in the beginning?
how much of a disadvantage was it not having more than a day of rest and also to get adjusted to the stadium, the court surface, these kind of things?
both of you made more or less twice as many unforced errors as winners. how did you find the speed of the court today?
given your results today, are you some way regretting your run in bercy last week? consequently, are you happier that for next season there will be a new week between the two tournaments?
today the court of arbitration for sport has decided to reduce the ban for a missed doping test for mr. troicki from 18 months to 12 months. i would like to have your opinion on that decision? do you think it's still too harsh for a missed test?
looking ahead to the rest of the tournament, what are your thoughts on the next opponents you could be facing?
you said you're tired. do you think seven weeks in a row is maybe a bit too much?
you found some great levels tonight. is he the hardest person to beat defensively? is he as strong as anyone you've played in defense?
we saw some mistakes. are you playing more irregular? do you take more risks?
how delighted were you by the reception you received tonight? like a home davis cup tie for you really.
can you talk about playing the terrific tiebreaker, then going into the third, sort of it slipping? also comment on how slow the surface is compared to last year.
after this loss, you have more pressure entering the next game. if you don't win, you can go home.
yes.
does it sting a little bit more because you lost to him twice in three days or is it just a case of a loss is a loss?
you have two tough rivals in the group.
what do you think you have to change, improve and keep to have a chance to reach the semifinals?
it's obviously disappointing today. in the general scheme of things, having had an inconsistent year with the back problems, to take a set off him twice in three days, isn't that positive in terms of the message you'll get at the end of this year?
i'd like to ask you about rafael nadal. tomorrow he will get no.1 if he wins. what do you think about his season? what adjective would you put to his 2013?
rafa said here yesterday that he thought the world tour finals should be played on a different surface every year to reflect the fact that you qualify for this tournament by playing on different surfaces throughout the year. do you have a view on that?
could you give us your assessment on tonight's victory over roger federer.
how physically demanding did you find that tonight?
you said you find the court slower than paris bercy or faster?
faster here?
how did you manage to handle yourself out there so well with all the support for roger, a davis cuplike atmosphere?
your next match is against del potro. what is the difference between the last match and the next one, shanghai?
i appreciate that you've played roger on a number of occasions. does it make any difference having played him three days ago to playing him now as far as winning that and coming into this one, so close to one another?
may i ask your reaction to troicki's ban being cut today?
along those lines, we don't have a leader of the tour, haven't had for a number of months. is that a role that might be able to address some of these issues? do you think it needs to be filled?
the ceo has the vote.
where do you think the match changed for you?
does your performance tonight give you confidence for the two more matches?
how is the energy out there?
there was the close hawkeye call late in the third set. we couldn't hear what was going on on the court. what was going on with that call?
we came here for a woman player, wheelchair player, esther vergeer. we are looking for some quotes from the top players about her. can you make some statements about her.
just how you saw that match, how disappointing it is to make a losing start.
so what was the main problem with stan when you play him? you have lost several matches now against him. you think it's pretty even, but he ends up winning. what's the reason that you see?
obviously you still have two more matches to play. how difficult is it to put yourself up? how optimistic do you still feel for the rest of the week?
you had the tough match against him in the davis cup, but you ended up winning. do you think his game has changed since the beginning of the year? has he gained confidence?
congratulations, first. how tough was it today to go through david?
i had a coach who always said that 75 sets were mostly mental. it's just that close. both times you served for it. do you feel today was more mental than physical or tactical?
you just won three consecutive tournaments; first time you do this since spring 2011. how important is it for you, and does it mean that we can consider that you're very close now to the level of game you had two years ago, twoandahalf years ago?
you have said that you have been working on your game lately. i guess you must be happy to have won 15 of 18 net points today. also, you made more than 10 backhand errors in the second set. can you comment on that.
is it reasonable to continue from asia, paris, masters, davis cup? i mean, it's almost crazy.
david was saying yesterday he thinks indoor might be his best surface. having seen him today and having beaten him relatively easily in australia, what makes his game work so well indoors with the conditions here?
when you say you were not feeling physically at your best today, is it just fatigue or is it something else?
david played a very, very solid match today, and it seems like you never really found your best game out there. how did you feel?
obviously disappointed. how do you plan to change things around for london? what do you think you need to correct to do better in london?
it was a strange match. you didn't seem to move as well as usual. you said you were slower than usual. were you affected by your stomach bug, or did you have any physical problem?
it's pretty unusual to get to play the same player two times in a row like you will against david. is there anything tactically you will be thinking about from this match going into the next one, or how is that sort of different preparation than usual?
in terms of the matchup, did you learn anything about david's game that you can use immediately for the next time, i guess?
you played at a very high level against janowicz and gasquet. when you have a day like this, do you just say, okay, it was a bad day at the office and you forget about it, or do you get a little bit worried about what may have gone wrong?
how big of a win is it for you to beat rafa after so many losses?
how big is it for you to finally beat rafa after so many losses?
what was the game plan today?
is there something magical in paris? because you're back in top shape here in paris after roland garros and bercy again?
what do you like here?
tomorrow you have a new big challenge against novak. what do you think about this match?
before this match you had a pretty bad record against rafa. what do you think before going into this match?
we know very well rafa. why do you think indoor hard court is maybe the worst surface for him?
can you talk about the way rafa played today? do you feel something was off in his game? what was it?
but for you, how do you feel indoor? is it good surface?
why?
have you watched your draw at the masters? is it tough to avoid thinking about next week?
your first set was really impressive. do you think that maybe the intensity at the end got back to you a little bit, or was it something else?
obviously it's a very quick turnaround for you, possibly playing as soon as monday in london.
you're playing tuesday?
okay. so how does that tournament go for you? do you leave tonight for london or...
how hard is it to go back to play the same person if you know you're playing novak? that doesn't happen much obviously, especially against a top guy.
you played a tough threesetter against del potro yesterday. do you feel maybe you didn't have much gas in the tank left in the last set today?
obviously you're playing better now. when you're playing better like this, what are the shots, the certain things about movement or whatever that tell you you know when you're playing better again, when you sort of have your game?
just a bit of a different question. one of the news items this morning was that at a train station in paris here del potro had one of his bags stolen from him today. i'm just wondering with all the travel you do all the time, has that ever happened to you? any port in your career having a bag stolen?
is that something you worry about, though?
you have some connections at wilson. have you talked to juan martin about the fact he's just down to two racquets? can you help him out in some way?
do frames go dead?
would you think with yours they would go dead?
in the first set you did a lot of volleys and chips, but in the second you didn't do that so much. was it because he played deeper and prevented you from doing that, or did you feel you were sort of getting into his own game?
what information do you draw from this week about your shape?
it didn't happen to you too many times in the past, but coming into the court as an outsider, as an underdog, does it feel strange?
talking about tactics, the quality of returns and defense of djoko and nadal, do you think you can still have tactics playing quickly against them, or do you always need to chip and mix it up?
we feel that now you are relying a lot more on being aggressive and going up to the net. you always did that, but even more now. maybe are you deliberately doing that?
so you know about the round robin. can you talk about the opponents? you will have to play maybe other players you played this week.
and if it's richard instead of stan, do you prefer?
you said london was slower than here.
they are supposed to be very similar.
but london last year was slower.
you were talking about long holidays. what are long holidays?
six weeks.
it was a very tough first hour of the match, and then progressively you found a way to turn this around. what was the key for you?
was there a bit of nerves maybe at the start with the crowd or anything? because they were mostly for your opponent. was it a factor?
you struggled a bit with your serve in the first set. what is the explanation for that sluggish start? were you kind of a bit nervous?
the groups were released for london while you were playing, and your first match there will be against roger again. i'm just wondering about playing him again so quickly. and also, just your group as a whole with del potro and gasquet.
do you think that you feel the crowd reaction is a little bit unfair for you? you are no.2 in the world, former no.1.
at least you have one fan, big fan: zlatan. do you know him from a long time, or what is the story?
how would you break down zlatan's tennis game, strengths and weaknesses that you say?
as a separate topic, one of the other stories today was about del potro, at a train station here in paris, having some of his bags stolen and his passport and other things. i was wondering, when you have been traveling, has anything like that happened to you in terms of having stuff stolen? is it something you worry about?
do you remember when and where it happened to you?
being no.1 at the end of this season is still a clear goal for you.
your backhand is usually considered a great weapon. do you think today it is still as good as two years ago? and do you still have as much confidence in your backhand?
you haven't lost a game since the final in the u.s. what was the click? can you explain it?
(in french.) will you be surprised to see ferrer going to the final here?
(in french.) do you have a message for the french crowd to support you?
congratulations. the start of the match was close, and then you really found your best game. tactically you were really on pointe. how did you feel on the court?
you're having a tremendous season on hard court. are you, yourself, surprised by how good you've been this year, and how do you explain your improvement on hard court compared to the other years?
in the past this tournament had a lot of surprising results. in past years players who haven't won other masters titles are winning here, but so far it's been a lot of the top players doing well. so far you and novak and roger are in the semis. what do you think made this year's tournament different than all the past years?
what are your thoughts on playing david ferrer or tomas berdych in the semifinal? how do you imagine the match?
i don't want to ask another question about hard courts, but how important was uncle toni in the way you're playing n hard courts now?
if you had a pick a winner between novak and roger tomorrow, who will it be and why?
the beginning of the match was all right, but after he became stronger, you went down, what happened?
in the second set you had double breakpoint against you and the crowd was trying to support you. maybe you were trying to please them and you were tense.
the beginning of the match was very interesting. the crowd got enthusiastic and you played well. suddenly it changed. so what happened then? were you frustrated?
you'll finish the season on a very good note. you will be in london. is it magical for you?
of course you want to do well, but there is also everything around this competition with the setting and the organization.
and you're in.
your opponent today, rafa, had a very good season. indoors, on hard courts, he had very few losses. what is your feeling playing against him on hard courts? do you think he's better than previous years on that surface?
indoors you were playing well. all the conditions were there. maybe you could have, for the first time, beaten him. but we had the feeling he was playing even better than in the us open this time.
do you really feel you have absolutely no solutions at all? you tried many things.
in the us open, you were hitting good backhands and he found a solution to that. he found the solution every time.
is it the himalaya?
do you still have energy and stamina for london, or is it tough to keep going?
so going into london, what is your schedule now?
jo will be the substitute in london. do you think you can count on him, for example, to hit in practice and have some advice? did you talk with him?
nadal is not an indoors player. that's what he says. but he proves he is today.
(in english.) can you tell us about how you're feeling physically and mentally and what your expectation are for london next week?
can you tell us a bit about your level in the first set and do you feel you're getting closer to your best tennis?
you haven't played novak this year; is that right?
do you think he's moved forward again this year in the kind of roundedness of his game?
would you consider this one of your best wins of this year? is that fair to say? did you feel that way coming off the court today?
first top 5 win of the year.
secondly, just resultswise, this tournament, bercy, has had a lot more of the top players getting deep than usually here. a lot of times there can be unexpected players here. does it feel different? what do you chalk up the success of the top players here to?
the crowd was particularly behind you today, and up 41 in the first set and during the changeover they applaud, etcetera. how did you feel that? the level of support we have the impression to be in basel. did you have this impression too, this feeling?
a question about juan martin del potro. what do you think of the tennis of juan martin during these last weeks? your impression.
can you talk about your rivalry with novak, and what do you like and what don't you like in his game?
i think i read somewhere that you would not go to south america like last year before next year, so what is your program? are you going to go to abu dhabi for exhibitions?
the last three times you played del potro he won; today you won. what changed today? you were stronger mentally, or you believe he was not in his best condition?
was it a sort of revenge today?
the question was asked in english, but i would like to come back on this. you were supported by the crowd today. the fans this year maybe thought you were in a difficult position and your love quota has increased. can you feel that? are you touched by that?
a word about the fact that that was your first victory against top 10 since january.
last time you played djokovic was in the final of the masters last year. in one year, what changed for you? how do you feel now compared with last year physically, mentally? how are you?
about dimitrov, he said it was not easy to play against your own idol. so maybe it was not easy for you to play against him knowing that he used you as his idol or his example. you managed the match perfectly well, but how was it for you?
how satisfied are you with the performance today?
your coach said he was impressed how good you played at the net today. are you surprised it clicked so fast for you to move forward?
speaking of the net, i know one shot of yours that some commentators have identified as a relative weakness is your overhead smash, in general. how much is that a focus for you? is that a shot that comes up relatively rarely and is not a huge concern?
the 8 in the quarterfinals here are the 8 that go to london. that rarely, rarely happens. has that surprised you that it's happened this year?
i have been impressed with your french this week. i have heard you speak italian, german, and mandarin in china, too. how many languages would you say you speak if you could rank them in order of proficiency maybe?
so can you tell us in french what did you...
what did you eat before the match, please?
you haven't played federer this season, so what will it mean?
for espn south america, i don't know if you speak spanish.
no, just about juan martin del potro. i want to know if something has changed when you have to play against him since these last weeks. what do you think about his new game?
how is your relation with him? you are the two with the great satisfaction with the football. with him you speak about football?
(in french.) if you play roger tomorrow, can you talk about the rivalry with roger? you haven't played him for a year now. what does it mean for you to play him in the semis here?
can you tell us what happened in your mind between 7:00 and 7:30? when you saw the match point of berdych, was it total excitement or what?
can you talk about your qualification for the masters? the first time you didn't have so many problems; this time you had more problems and you made it in a more difficult way.
so about your emotions, watching the end of the match between raonic and berdych, did you kiss berdych?
about the match against nishikori, how did it go? it was quite tight in the beginning.
if nadal wins tonight you will have good taste of what is going to happen in london the week after. how are you going to live that?
but you played a lot this season and that was a risk you took, six weeks in a row. in moscow you wanted to go; the team was not so sure you should go. can you explain?
"masters" is a magical word, a magical atmosphere. you were in london last year as a substitute. can you talk about it.
can you just talk a bit about the year you have had and obviously the fact that now you've reached london and your thoughts about going back to that seasonending event?
can you remember 2007 and qualifying and what that was like to play in the tournament?
you have won all your previous matches against kohlschreiber. how did you have enough motivation before such a match?
is it quite important to get matches done economically in terms of your energy, because you could have a deep run here and then turn it around really quickly for the o2?
if a couple of results work in his favor, stan will be in the finals for the first time. what will it be like to have some swiss company? what do you think his season has been like?
how do the play conditions compare with basel last week, and how do you think the difference, if any, would play tomorrow?
yesterday you talked about a block of four weeks training after the us open. does this mean you worked a lot physically? a lot on the court? wasn't that the only time where your back gave you a break?
we think you lost weight; is it true?
you are part of the 16 30yearold players winning at least one tournament this year. they had a lot of success. what do you think of that?
so you're qualified for the masters. we are still waiting to know whether richard will qualify. maybe soon. we don't know. if he does, richard will participate in his second masters after 2007. what do you think of that? would you be happy to see richard back to that level of the competition?
do you think he improved, he's better now?
you lost the last three matches against del potro. do you believe mentally he has sort of a domination over you?
how frustrating is it to have so many break points and to have to wait and just say, okay, he's gonna serve an ace maybe?
how do you feel about that?
what do you think, novak, particularly you just swung the match so hard in your favor through the second and the third? was it just a matter of getting one break and that was it, or...
was it his abdominal you were talking about at the net?
can you talk about finding again stanislas wawrinka in your way in a tournament?
a less serious question, but there was no mask on your face today on the court. people are complaining.
you have had some great moments this year and some frustrating ones. how important are the last two tournaments, and how do you think you'll remember 2013?
does marin cilic having his suspension reduced and being able to come back this week make you more optimistic for having viktor back for the davis cup final potentially?
do you think he will be ready after having that many months off to come back for a davis cup final? it's a big ask.
everybody noticed you improved considerably your french.
is it important for you to speak french? is it difficult to learn?
what is your favorite word in french?
when you lost your lead in the tiebreaker and you had to go to a third set, what happened in your mind?
what were these difficulties?
but you are satisfied that you were able to win that battle in difficult conditions? are you thinking it's positive, or...
is it because of your injury in valencia?
what do you expect against ferrer?
you won last time you played him. what memories do you have of that match?
this is the last tournament of the year. it's paris. why can't you be relaxed?
maybe you had to defend a lot? it made it more complicated? you had to defend many points?
you were able to play 25 or 26 tournaments this year. do you believe you played too much, although your injuries were not totally cured?
i'm asking a questions to the players' representative. i would like to come back on the jaziri case and the pressures he had. were you consulted by atp?
are you following this race for the masters, although you're not involved?
there was an article recently where you were saying that you are not recognized at the value you have, that there were more criticisms than compliments about you. is it true? do you feel you're not recognized, i mean, especially compared to other french players? that's the key, too?
tonight it was a tight match. more difficult than your two previous meetings against marcel. what's the explanation? the surface? because you haven't played for a while?
could you perhaps just explain why, how difficult it is to adjust again to indoors rather than outdoors? what specific things do you have to work on indoors?
in these conditions to play janowicz tomorrow, is that the best news?
his style of play?
what do you think about his game?
you won a lot of matches this season so you have a lot of confidence. do you feel even with this confidence it's still hard for you to be sure of yourself indoors, or it's getting easier because you know you have won so many matches?
it was close. mentally you were quite strong. you came back often, especially in the tiebreaker. how did you experience that match?
but anyway, this year ends but you, i'm sure, are happy for that?
how far do you want to go next year? what can you work on?
i think most french spectators remember your tears in the french open, but what is your best memory of this season after all the good things you did after that?
sorry if i make you repeat something, but in the third set you seemed to be hurting somewhere.
if you had to choose one goal for 2014, what would it be?
you are the defending champion here. do you feel a bit more pressure than usual?
well played. 23 consecutive slam semis; 12 consecutive appearances in a masters. do you have an opinion as to which is a bigger achievement?
as many times as you have made it, even tonight when you're serving at 52 and then serving at 54, are there little nerves playing around there a little bit?
i think you mentioned the word "tough" three times in that answer.
can you elucidate a little bit on that? how tough? i mean, how tough is tough for you?
you had a good run in basel. what about your confidence? i mean, can make a huge difference. do you think it's where it should be for you to play at your best?
can you remember 2002, the match that settled your qualification?
which one was it, for those of us who have terrible memories?
what are your feelings on the condition of play here, the court, the balls? what do you think about it?
you heard about what happened to marek jaziri and the pressure he felt with the religious and political pressure. as a player representative, what do you think about this?
during this past month, did you really have doubts about your qualification?
12th qualification for the masters. what does it mean for you?
you only won one tournament this year and you went to no grand slam final this year. do you feel that the way other players look at you has changed?
well, yes, their way of looking at you has changed, they say. you believe they have more chances against you, or they think they have?
your back problems are in the past?
you just had a bitter experience in switzerland because del potro won the tournament, but you might maybe play against him in the quarterfinal. how do you see that match? if i'm allowed a second question, we have been talking for a month of the beginning of the end of roger federer. you, personally, do you want to say maybe to us, just let me alone, let me play?
the fact of having a hard time qualifying yourself for this masters, is it going to give more value to this tournament?
the first set was decisive. everything went well after that?
are you watching the top 50 with a lot of attention?
next opponent is gilles simon. what do you think of your head to head with him?
there are many players injured or tired. how are you?
so this is a good opportunity for you here.
jo officially was saying...
so what do you think about the cooperation with jo's coaches?
so maybe you can change your doubles partner and play with jo because maybe your schedules will be made together?
i was talking about the doubles because mika is going to be in the position you had last year. you might not be able to play the same tournaments.
how can you sum up this match?
talking about the indoor conditions, it was difficult for you in russia, too. do you have more trouble on this type of surface?
what is your program now?
talk about the season. there was wimbledon. what are your goals for the next season?
when you said your goals were reached, what kind of goals did you have?
you're talking about holidays, aren't you playing doubles with gal?
did you play with him already in doubles?
how did you feel today on the court and how satisfied are you with this win?
i know you have talked about it already, but could you tell us again what you have been through, what sort of a nightmare it was, and what sort of relief it was to know that in the end you would play tournaments this season?
just to be clear, then, has this emerged since september the 13th that your test was not accurate?
so it was incorrect, the information, on september the 13th?
do you think the itf has been dealing well in that case for the good of the players? do you think they should have gone public before you had the chance to defend yourself? do you think they should have maybe keep the information before coming to the right conclusion?
are you happy they disclosed the fact you tested positive before you could defend yourself and prove that you were not doping?
what do you think could have been handled better in your case?
do you think, generally speaking, that the itf didn't handle the case very professionally? and do you think that's the second question that maybe you're the victim of the fact that itf has tried to toughen their doping policy lately, and that maybe for the time being the procedures are not quite right?
do you also regret that apparently itf asked you to pretend you were injured at wimbledon?
i don't think the ruling from cas has been published beyond the press release. to be clear, it's obviously a complicated matter. you're saying that at the cas tribunal here, which obviously none of us were there, they told you that it was actually much less nikethamide in your system than you were originally told and what was originally thought at the september hearing?
rafa said he was happy you were back on tour, that he thinks you're a great guy and a great player. do you think at this moment you also need the support of other players, because to have the emails and all the fans, do you think it's important to have somebody like rafa saying he's happy you're back?
there were a lot of mistakes in that game. it took time for you to be comfortable.
this is not your favorite surface. maybe you were not confident. because you were up in the second set.
you were quite static. did you lack energy?
so talking about your season, how would you rate this season?
do you think you lost the possibility of being seeded in melbourne?
you still have team competition to play, and then you're going to the mauritius islands, or you don't know yet?
can you say a few words about your new coach? how different is he?
going backwards, what lesson did you draw from your loss against tsonga in the french open, about your mental condition or...
we felt you had no energy left, no stamina. usually you are quite good at the net, and today it didn't work out. did you really feel you were down?
you were saying that the final in kuala lumpur might have affected you more than you thought.
so when you know you're not 100%, when you play, you're not having fun anymore?
what do you intend to do in the next weeks?
about doubles, do you know who you're going to play with next year?
during the australian open when you were sidelined, if someone said to you that in the warmup clay tournaments you played you would do extremely well and then come here on hard court and beat roger in straight sets and berdych and then reach the finals, what would you say to them?
when you come back after so long off, what is the most difficult thing to get back at a high level?
last week when you arrived here you said you didn't think you could win the title. what do you think now?
if you could just talk briefly about how much you think your confidence has improved since i guess in the final against zeballos? and then also sort of a separate question about do you think the conditions here  the highkicking balls off the court  do you think this is as uncomfortable a hard court for you as it is anywhere in the world?
two things: can you talk more about the serve? you won a lot of big points with it today. and number two, you've played novak 33 times. if you do play him in the final, is it everything new or can you reflect back on all the other matches?
yesterday in a tv interview, lionel messi said that he admires kobe bryant and four tennis players: djokovic, federer, del potro, and you. have you met messi, and who do you admire outside tennis?
you had battled it out in the second set. how important was it to make sure it didn't go to a third?
it was a tremendous match. what turned it around from love3 in the third?
was it hard to play today?
too warm?
shadows?
he seems to have added a bit more to his game: a little slice here and there, dropshots, not all explosive. does that mixing up a bit of the game make him the more difficult opponent these days?
you tend to use setbacks as even extra, more motivation, novak. you've got a long season to come. streaks have to come to an end, don't they? it just happens?
he took an olympic medal from you. does that stick into the back of your head or do you put that away?
can you take a moment and compare his forehand, his weapon, to some of the other great forehands in the game?
did rafa's game change in any way since you played him last?
how closely have you been following his comeback? how much do you think all of the players been doing the same, curious how he's playing during all that time off?
how do you think you played today?
but how do you think you played?
is there anything to stop him from just doing his usual run on clay and then going deep in wimbledon? do you see anything that could possibly stop that?
what did you think on that overhead? was it just the sun?
as far as movement about the court, did rafa look like the rafa of old today?
what do you think when someone comes back from seven months off and plays so well so quickly? do you think they're just an incredible player? do you think injury must not have been so bad? what do you think?
what kind of positives will you take out of this tournament for yourself?
is that a new watch?
how do you sum up that match? such a tight first set.
serving, there were eight double faults. was that a problem for you or do you...
there are very small margins in games like this. the way he was playing, you probably weren't going to get too many looks at his serve. he offered a couple of break points, i think. how did you read those two incidents?
net cord, yeah.
you hurt yourself right near the end. you stepped wrong.
juan obviously won the us open and he had that terrible injury. he's sort of in an extended new phase now. in terms of the grand slams and getting past all the players, what do you think his chances are of winning another grand slam title?
in the past when you played him you used a lot of variety: dropshots, slice. do you think you did enough of that today, played the way you wanted to play?
wellplayed.
you and david ferrer are the sort of leaders of the pack, of the group who are trying to get in amongst the top 4. how close do you think you are? are you getting closer, do you feel?
do you feel you're playing at your best now? are you happy with your game?
you had this very tough davis cup weekend in switzerland with the doubles. how long did it take you to regroup and to get ready again? because you played a lot of tennis there.
what do you think about this position where you have to wait for the winner of the federer/nadal match? and secondly, can you talk about meeting the winner in the semifinals.
why do you think you had pretty much success against roger recently; whereas if you look at rafa, you've lost quite a few matches now?
the czech republic has one of the great traditions in tennis. could you just take a moment and try and reflect on it, the style of czech tennis, what makes czech tennis so wonderful.
talking about your early years and motivation, do you remember or did you hear stories of the turmoil in your country, or could you just talk about your early motivation in your early years.
how disappointing is that considering you played pretty well and just a few lapses maybe?
could you have used a hawkeye on that match point? would that have been useful? i mean, there wasn't one on the court.
you seemed to hold your serve pretty easily right up until the end of both those sets. is it difficult to keep the negative thoughts out when you're serving at 45 or 56?
did you have the feeling that your return kind of let you down today? because you had a lot of trouble returning and getting second serves.
any trouble with the heat today?
it was a pretty straightforward match in terms of tactics and all that. is there anything going on that we don't see in terms of, you know, things you're trying to do or where you're trying to play, that kind of stuff?
did it bother you then in the first point of the last game?
the last game.
third.
yeah.
go through the whole thing of the last point and your idea in hitting it and then the confusion afterwards with no hawkeye available.
you didn't realize it was match point?
you thought it was 34 in games?
looking ahead to the april davis cup tie with italy, any question about what the team makeup will be, or is it you and frank for the singles spot on the team that got you there, now that jesse is available?
you played tsonga twice and they were two very tough losses. was it just a fluke, or is it something in the matchup that just doesn't fit you?
is getting the knee treated at the end of the first set, did that factor in any way?
in general, the heat, speed of the court, all those sort of conditions together, how were they today?
that was quite a tough match all the way through.
was his grunting bothering you some? did you talk to the chair umpire about that?
he said he had no idea that it would annoy you.
when grunting has been talked about before, it's been pretty much framed as a women'sonly issue. the wta have made statements about it. do you think it's something the atp should look into and try to reign in, too?
has it ever distracted you before?
the last time you played him you don't remember that?
you played him three or four years ago, no?
were you asking the umpire to actually tell him to quiet down?
you follow the women's tour a lot more closely than any of the other top guys, it seems like. when you watch some of the loud grunters on the women's side, does it annoy you, as well?
how do you see the next match, del potro?
you're a big follower of boxing, which some say would have some similarities with tennis: one on one, knockout punch, quickness. what do you think you can learn most from boxing that would apply to this sport?
and a boxer who's most inspired you? who do you like most?
do you think the chair umpire should have said something to berlocq about the grunting?
what is your reaction to roger draper's decision to resign from the lta?
well, do you think he's done a good job?
success rate of sort of developing players in his time there.
have you got any thoughts on who should replace him?
there is a report recently from a british paper from an american doping expert saying the biological passport would take four or five years to set up. did you see that, and any thoughts on that?
novak obviously is a fantastic player where actually you can say a lot of the same strengths that you have with backhand return, movement, conditioning, toughness. can you talk about one or two areas where you can try and attack novak and try and break him down, or not?
what are your thoughts? obviously you played stan a lot, and every time almost it's gone your way. what is it about these dynamics that help it shift to you time and time again?
how would you rate your fitness with your back and all that? did it bother you? is it okay now?
one of the things fans always want to know is what makes great champions great. after your '09 wimbledon win, this picture of laver and bjrn and pete was taken, one of the great pictures we have. could you talk about what you think the common threads are between the four of you, will or determination or whatever?
obviously we don't know who you're going to come up against, but could you first look at potential of playing rafa and then look at the potential of playing gulbis?
i know that the la event's place on the calendar conspired against you really being able to play in it. is it sort of crazy to think you might go your entire career without every playing a competitive match in this city that some people regard as the entertainment capital of the world?
there has been a lot of guys in the tournament who have been grunting very loudly, and some other players have been complaining about that. it's been framed historically as a women'sonly issue, and the wta have issued statements on it. has it ever bothered you in a match, playing or watching, and do you think the atp should ever try to do anything about it?
has an opponent ever bothered you?
where do you rank winning your 17th major at wimbledon among your career achievements, and how will that win inspire you moving into the grass season this year?
can i ask you to talk about your reaction to the los angeles and san jose tournaments leaving the states and why you think that is and what, if any, effect that has on american tennis?
to follow on that, how much at all does that hurt tennis in the u.s. if you don't have a southern california men's event?
well, los angeles, two southern california events.
do you think the la tennis challenge could ever fill that niche?
do you remember the first professional event you attended as a fan? was it the event at ucla?
okay.
did that make you more into tennis when you saw it in person?
why were you more interested in those sports as a youngster?
that was a real battle out there, up and down, double faults. talk about the battle and how you got how it.
you're going to have to really step it up, obviously for djokovic, but you're also the last guy that beat him, so you know how to do that.
what makes it so tough to play him?
what does it mean to be the topranked american?
have you spoken with mardy or john about what it's like to kind of have that no.1 american next to your name?
do you feel like it doesn't make a difference unless you're no.1 overall in terms of how you're seen here? in america, i mean.
you said you're pushing each other. why do you think it's so completely difficult to get some guys outside the usa in the semis and in the final? you, mardy, john, why so difficult for you?
to go to the final, to go to the semis.
can you talk about the growth in popularity in doubles and what makes you do decide to do doubles and what it adds to your game as a singles player?
kind of a different situation today. same time but hotter conditions. on paper, tougher opponent, bigger crowd. how did it feel out there?
the second set, obviously it was 40, 4all, lots of breaks; tiebreak didn't go well. was that a function of lack of match play?
you sound disappointed, but after your last match you said it was just good to be back out there and the result didn't matter much. is it encouraging that the loss stings a little bit?
did you find yourself knowing how to manage frustration? you spoke about anxiety and trying to stay calm on the court. in the second set, was it the frustration that was getting to you that maybe you wanted to calm down a little bit more and had problems?
would you like to play davis cup in boise?
how much more comfortable do you imagine you'll be going into miami now having these singles matches and the doubles matches, two under your belt? how much easier is it going to be going forward, if at all?
can you talk about your reaction to the la tournaments going overseas, why you think it happened, and what it means for u.s. tennis?
how does has that tournament changed the way you look into the future? how far in the future are you looking at careerwise?
you went through this long period which is pretty solitary with your family, your team, away from the limelight. then to go have a week where you're a promoter, player, fundraiser, and out here, a lot of press. what's your takeaway from this? are you pleased with this week? just reflect on the week as a whole.
briefly you were winded after the novak set today? how is your...
you said you haven't been back in the tournament environment for a while. can you talk about the perception you have had from players you haven't seen in the last couple of months?
in the next ranking sam querrey is going to be u.s. no.1 for the first time. you had that happen to you a couple years ago. what sort of advice would you give them or what would you tell him do you wish you had known about that sort of mantle?
two questions: first, what do you think about dimitrov's play? he's the youngest player that's at this stage of the tournament. and second question is did you watch the game between bara and milan?
you have played doubles here a lot in the past, it's one of the big doubles tournaments that a lot of the top singles players do play. can you talk about why you think that is and why you chose not to play doubles here?
with the way dimitrov started today, were you concerned at that point, or did you feel, as you just pointed out, the inexperience aspect and that maybe things started walking away from him the way he was playing?
you said it wasn't a beautiful match; he made a lot of unforced errors. apart from you getting the w, what positives do you take out of it today?
after experiencing la tennis challenge, the electricity and the vibe, did you walk away feeling that it's more important than ever to try to get a tournament that you're able to fit into your schedule back to la, or how important for the growth of tennis do you think it is having an event in that area?
obviously you're no.1  which let's not take it for granted is a great achievement  and you have so many strengths in your game: backhand, return, defense to offense, your fitness and game management. all of that. put your analytical hat on. what are your two or three greatest strengths? and also the flipside, if there is one thing you'd like to work on.
how did you upgrade your serve?
there has been a lot of coverage in the media about your glutenfree diet. i live in belgrade, and all i eat there is pizza and meat.
yes, i do. i work for a serbian paper, actually. i'm very brown so i kind of stand out. but anyway, i'm always like meat, pizza, pizza, meat. where do you eat when you're back home?
it's delicious.
your next opponent is actually the last player to beat you. does that have any bearing coming into a match like this a few months later? talk about the matchup a little bit with sam.
is it kind of a letdown? how close were you to the match when you found out?
did he say anything to you, i'm sorry, or tell you he couldn't play, or did you guys not talk?
will you practice extra today?
i saw on social media you were maybe having a hit with larry ellison. i just want to know your thoughts on him and his contribution to the sport and this tournament.
did you talk to about tennis or business...
did you feel the earthquake this morning?
what were you doing at the time?
it's supposed to be very hot, 90, i don't know, 32, 33.
yeah, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday. do you like that?
just when the earthquake hit, how long did it take you to figure out since this was your first one what was going on? when you're preparing and all of a sudden the ground starts shaking, how long did it take you to figure out it was an earthquake?
well, 13 now; on a streak. was that one of the toughest of that 13 today?
do you think this is the kind of match you would have lost, you know, in previous parts of your career?
so you've played nadal four times. most of them have been close, but you haven't been able to get over the hump. can you just talk about what would make the difference to get you the win this time?
we all know what his titles are and how great he is. can you describe facing him, what his ball feels like and how he moves?
yes. can you? can you describe what it's like to play nadal?
do you think you're going into this match with nadal more confident than you've ever been in the times you have faced him before?
do you think the day off has helped him or hurt him?
can you just talk about how hard it is to hit a winner against him?
well, it's a big match. when you're hitting a ball against him, i would think it's not like playing a normal guy trying to hit a winner, no?
you have had a lot of success on a bunch of different surfaces. do you feel any one of them is harder on your body than another?
have you had injury problems before when you had a lot of matches?
have you woken up any time in the last couple of days and said to yourself, i can't believe i'm winning this many matches in a row?
and that reality is what?
do you think you were fortunate to win the match against tommy haas in delray beach?
yes.
why do you think you pulled off those two?
what was your earthquake experience like?
earthquake, the earthquake this morning.
you didn't feel it?
where were you when it happened?
where were you this morning?
is your back okay? it seemed like you were clutching it a little bit at the end?
it's nothing to keep you out of playing your next match?
question related to south africa. you obviously have a deep connection, 10 years of incredible work there, 50,000 kids. my understanding was that you were seeking to connect somehow with president mandela.
this morning there was an earthquake. did you feel it? where were you when it came through? and also, have you ever been through one before?
the weather is supposed to get quite warm over the next few days. how do you go from playing in sort of comfortable conditions? do you change your approach to the match, or does it all just stay the same for you?
just going back to your back for a second, you took a longer time than normal to come your press conference. did you have treatment? the back has in the past given you problems. is it something you won't know until very close to the match?
is it the same kind of tweak you felt in the past?
you have less tournaments in 2013. are you considering playing tournaments you haven't played before or haven't won before?
maybe washington, d.c.?
back to your back, do you have to deal with your back or look after your back more than other parts of your body?
do you have to do anything extra, like hang upside down?
the long break you're taking, a, is that absolutely set in stone what you're going to do? and secondly, related to that, is that a kind of signal that the rankings are now sort of further down in your priority list?
is it set in stone?
is it a signal maybe that the rankings are not as big a deal for you?
what surface has been the most wearing on your body and your back specifically? do you agree with those that say the tour should look at having fewer hard court tournaments?
knowing mardy's struggles the last several months, were you emotional for him? he seemed kind of emotional at the end.
what is it that keeps you going at this age when most of the time you don't get to play at this level of tournament or on this kind of stadium court?
the last two service games obviously you doublefaulted, 43 and some errors in the other one. was that a case of nerves? getting close to the finish line? what was happening?
you're closer for the washington kastles, aren't you? you played the last match. there is a lot of pressure on that. you're on a 32match winning streak, which is incredible. so what's the difference? is there a difference?
what's the general take in the locker room about mardy and his situation?
obviously world teamtennis is only one month a year, but at this point in your career, how much of a big part of your profession does it feel like having all the success you've had there?
how did you get into it? who got you in?
are you kind of a star there in the league?
i'd like to ask a question about the length of sets. in regulation tennis, sixgame set, it's not like it's a marathon exactly, but there are certain lulls, especially after the first set. do you like the fivegame format? do you think that has a greater intensity? do you think it should be considered?
what's your take on the new time violation rules and enforcement?
a shot clock, is that something you would be in favor of?
rafa pointed out players like he and novak did at the australia played some really long, intense points. it's hard to expect you to be right back ready to play in 25 seconds, and you'll see more ugly points if it's enforced because guys just don't have time to catch their breath after...
you also played a couple of challengers i think with the let rule.
you have done that world teamtennis a lot. what do you think about that? do you think there's any chance what do the guys think about it?
has there been any talk of going the other way, that if it nicks the net it's a fault no matter where it lands?
you're supposed to clear the net.
so what was the energy like as the kastles were winning and winning and winning? was there a certain energy or sense of inevitability?
did you meet like michelle obama?
and your take on michelle? pretty athletic family.
tight match. you were in there. almost broke back. what was the difference in your mind?
do you feel like it's a question of confidence in certain moments or just not quite getting on a run yet this year?
you're defending finalround points coming in here. any pressure?
you weren't even thinking about it?
you want to just assess your year overall.
how are you feeling with your schedule? you skipped australia. you played a bunch of events, davis cup, san jose, memphis, delray. do you feel fresh enough coming in here?
are you practicing well? do you feel like you're striking the ball well in practice?
so you're not quite bringing that into matches?
because?
talk about the mindset playing someone like lleyton. he's scrappy, gets to every ball. how did that change your game today? what did you have to do differently and why didn't it work?
it's tough to pivot from one event to the next, but down the line, of course, there's davis cup, and i presume you're going to want to play. can you talk a little bit about playing in a small city, not known for tennis, high altitude, playing against a tough team? just reflect on that.
is the knee still holding up well?
given all the matches you've played, it...
what do you think you do from here to get back on the track you want to be on?
i know obviously you broke out in d.c. winning five straight third tiebreakers. margins have always been small for you in your career.
is there anything you can do to make them bigger?
you used the phrase "one good thing." well, one good thing is georgia had a big win over kentucky the other night. assess their chances of a decent run in the postseason.
how much is a factor of nerves, possible nerves in the match when you're up against somebody like hewitt who just doesn't let up?
when you talk about starting on stadium, that's probably something that comes from being the no.1 american and playing in the u.s. is that something that's been harder for you to adjust to than you thought, or...
always thin margins with someone like that. just talk about the match.
how does a win like that feel to you?
isner said a few moments ago that he was nervous in the match.
yeah. do you feel that he's a player that if you stick with him, with the big game he's got, if you can, you know, get it back at him, that maybe there will be that mental break?
he very rarely breaks. why would that be? not producing enough from the back court?
what about his return?
could you talk a little bit about just the serves you have faced? obviously a lot of big serves these days with ivo and raonic. can you talk about those, and also how these big servers compete compared to someone like pete?
have novak and andy both improved their serves?
where does this rank in the last couple of years? big win, stadium, in front of an american crowd; how does it stack up?
there is a lot of soul searching in australia about tennis. we might have a situation with no american men in the top 20 for the first time since the computer, so can you comment a little bit about that? is that something you should be worried about or not?
does it feel different for you? you played a grand slam final in newyork against sampras and won. you have played of over a decade in america. do you feel different, the mood of american tennis playing in america now than it did when there were more top guys ten years ago?
were you saying on tv because of your foot surgeries that you have had to adjust the way you run?
can you talk about that a little bit? did you relearn something about movement?
part of tennis is just walking out on the court and knowing that you're going to perform in front of thousands and thousands of people. of all the different big stadiums you walk out on, what gives you the biggest charge, which stadium when you just walk out?
and the long walk at the australian and wimbledon, very lowkey without any announcements, just chair those two, then.
how much does a win like this motivate you to continue on the road that you have been going on for the last a little bit?
can you put your commentator's hat on and tell us what you expect from nadal tonight? first match on hard court.
what is it about this event that you perform so well at? does it seem like a decade ago that you won this title?
seemed like you were getting very upset with the chair umpire early in the second set. talk about what happened there.
why do you think you were tired?
how good is his serve comparatively speaking on the tour? where does it rank for you to play? is he up there with the isners and karlovics? his serve.
how difficult is it to play in indian wells, the courts, the ball? does the ball fly for you?
you were talking to the chair umpire. was it the same chair umpire you had in doubles yesterday?
did you feel like you were playing well coming into this tournament? were you happy with your game?
what is your level of disappointment? because we don't see you lose early in tournaments very often.
is it easy for you to bounce back?
how important is it for you to stay in the top 4 where you're ranked now? do you think can you get any higher?
you say top 10, but you're top 5 now. are you setting low expectations for yourself?
rafa played a high level against you when you played recently on clay. do you expect him to be able to keep that kind of level on a hard court, especially his first tournament?
was that a rather straightforward day of work out there?
guy you played in the final last year, john isner, will no longer be the american no.1 after this. you played him really early at the us open. what do you think about how his year has gone and just american are tennis in general?
you know, mentioning isner, he made a quick rise, sort of starting to stumble a little bit. having been in the game a while and stayed on top, was it harder to make the climb or is it harder to stay on top?
are you interested to see how rafa does tonight, or does it not matter? will you watch or not watch? what will be a sign...
what will be a sign on a hard court that he's playing well? anything in particular?
obviously the top four players have had this incredible dominance at slams for a good period now. but if you could take a moment and reflect on the other top players outside the four, like berdych or del poe or tsonga, ferrer, maybe raonic, who do you think are one or two with the best shot to break through and win a slam?
in that 4 through 8 range, is there one you could give an edge to as having the best shot?
last fall when the atp rejected the prize increase here, you said you were going to investigate. i was going to ask if you did and if the issue has been resolved to your satisfaction?
when the weather starts changing and it's cooler, is it hard to stay loose or do you try to speed your game up a bit?
can you talk about the elbow surgery i guess you had pretty recently?
which arm? which elbow?
could you have imagined at that point beating david ferrer in march?
does it hurt still?
how nice a win was that today?
sounded like you were making him a little cranky on the court. he was doing a lot of complaining, it sounded like. does that bother you?
cliff dysdale has just come into the hall of fame, raymond runs the show here, and wayne has the record for consecutive slams. can you take a moment and talk about south african tennis and in recent years and your thoughts on that?
as a guy who is a big server, how do you learn what  the times when you have to try to go for a breaker we were just watching isner who lost, and he just seems to have a hard time knowing when to get a service break on his own to solidify his serve. is that a hard thing for a guy who has one weapon to learn how to do?
when you have that one big weapon, is it hard to try to learn the rest of the game or advance the rest of your game?
can you just comment on the conditions? because obviously the desert air being thinner, the ball will fly faster. players were talking about the grittiness of the courts. how has it been?
you briefly mentioned rugby in south africa. president mandela used rugby in a major way in his presidency and obviously was a boxer in the past and has had many tennis events. have you had any encounters with him, and what are your thoughts about his role in your country?
have you talked about the 25second rule? some of the guys are still complaining about it. just your thoughts on it and where the council is.
if it was affordable, would you be in favor of a shot clock? i heard some guys talk about that, too, so they actually know what the time is rather than...
so is that whether it's flexible or not flexible, and if there are different umpires calling it different ways, you guys almost have to find a way to get with the umpires and try to find...
do you find in general players who are younger are sort of resistant to change?
bad luck? good start. how did it get away from you?
how were the conditions out there? did the wind affect you at all?
when you look at all the young american women coming up, there seems to be nine or ten all of a sudden who are winning and climbing the rankings. are you jealous? do you wish you had that competition amongst young american men, or does it matter? they said they kind of push each other.
towards the end of the second set you were saying something back and forth with the ref or umpire. what was going on there?
you seem pretty disappointed. did you feel like the match was in your hands?
you had a hard time shaking him off in the third set.
what positives will you take out of this match?
what would be a successful year for you?
you know, like you, i grew up in nebraska where the weather is terrible and tennis courts aren't all that plentiful. do you suppose you might be further ahead in your tennis career had you been somewhere else?
do you feel that you're struggling more with yourself or you're sort of learning the ropes of the pro tour? you're still a young guy. do you feel like you're playing at that level but you're just struggling with consistency or what's going on?
when you spelled out your ambitions for this year, you talked about competing. you didn't say anything about winning. do you think you're sufficiently ambitious?
watching that match, towards the end of the second set, as you started to seemingly get frustrated with the ump, i think you were counting a little bit how long it was taking the ball kids to get the ball. do you think that that frustration affects your play at all?
some of the other younger players will say that learning to focus point to point like some of the veteran stars do is a big challenge and a learning curve, never turning your mind off at any point at any time. do you feel that way?
you've faced ivo's serve today, which is a big ask, and you had milos in memphis. can you compare their serves? who has the toughest serve and toughest stroke you've faced?
you were working with a usta coach in san jose, memphis, and delray. is nystrom back with you, too? what's the situation?
can we go back to nebraska for a minute? do you have one fun story you could share from your days back there? got anything of interest at all?
did your parents ever make you shovel snow?
you didn't win, but do you feel you can be satisfied with your performance in your first atp final?
what was the difference?
being in your first finals, was there a feeling of nerves going on court?
53 and you're serving for the first set. few minutes later you didn't win a point in the tiebreaker. does that just explain the difference between a player with his ranking and yours, or lack is that of experience? what do you put that down to?
you get up in the second set 43; you got the break. did you expect him to come back the next game and just play great?
mentally you seem to have a great maturity and composition not to get nervous in front of such a big opponent. what do you think it's going to take for you to reach the final of a major now?
do you think you have maybe three or four fiveset matches in you for melbourne, or do you feel that if you get involved in a couple long ones you're not quite there yet?
do you have a target for how far you want to go in melbourne?
where do you see your strengths and weaknesses looking forward?
twitter is in a state of excitement because an espn correspondent tweeted that you and maria are a confirmed item.
so what did this week show you about yourself and potentially going forward?
is there such a thing as too many matches leading to a grand slam? if you go to sydney and reach another final, is that too much, or do you think you can handle that workload?
there's been a lot talk about the top 4. what do you think differentiates them from the rest?
knowing that if you were to draw one of them in melbourne, is there anything you would do differently?
andy or any of the big four.
out of andy, roger, and novak, who do you fear the most?
yeah.
who would you most feel intimidated by?
you were saying he's one of the best return of servers in the world. when you're serving, do you feel like you can fool him, or is he reading you all the time?
disappointing way to finish a match. how is your knee going to feel tomorrow?
so you got out to a very fast start. that was obviously part of your mentality, to get some quick points.
how do you think you'll recover ahead of the australian open?
are you concerned that you might have to miss the first major of the season?
did you have any diagnosis from the physio as to what it may be?
do you take confidence knowing that you can push players like murray?
did you see much of the earlier semifinal?
what did you think of what he might challenge andy with tomorrow?
when did you get an idea that he may be struggling?
do you go and do bit of practice now?
you watched the end of dimitrov's match against baghdatis, or a lot of it?
what is your take on his level? you haven't played him since 2011. did he show you something today?
he's a guy that has been tipped to be a big player for a while. do you think he's the kind of player that the tour needs to come through as the next generation?
you think the physical evolution is kind of more than the mental?
what's your take on the umpires being more proactive with the time violations? marcos got two or three today.
do you think the umpires are going to have to have a lot of the discretion, like the duration of the match? the conditions?
how well do you think you're playing at the moment?
for grigor, nerves, how much a factor do you think they'll be in his first final? what was it like for you preparing for your first final?
you've played some different players this week. how does that fit in with your preparation?
it's clear that the slams are considered by the players and most people the most important events in the world. sometimes we have situations in the last couple days with victoria and the nishikori where they feel like they want to protect their body at all costs to make sure they're okay for melbourne, but maybe hurts the tournament they're in. talk about that.
first final. how satisfying?
how were the nerves today? you started the first set really well? did it feel look you were ready to meet this moment?
how big was that backhand down the line pass at 44 in the tiebreak?
what's your take on the time violation? did that have much of an impact there?
there is more focus on it now than there has been for a long time. could you empathize with him a little bit or not?
do you feel the stricter policing of that rule is a good thing for tennis?
in the tiebreak at 5all, what's going through your head?
yeah.
talk about playing murray, if that's who you play tomorrow?
what particularly will you need to do well to beat him?
talk a little bit about you made a big decision at the end of last year to go with a new coaching team, and you went to sweden and spent your time there training. why did you make that decision, and why did you feel it was necessary for you going into this season?
what did you see as the biggest benefit you've gained with a new coach?
did you feel stale under the old setup, or did you just think it was time to change, to sort of move into the next phase of your career?
have you set yourself a rankings goal for this year?
you been talked about as a player with enormous potential for three years now. do you think you've come close to reaching your potential?
was it hard having those comparisons to other players?
people said at one point roger federer like. did you think that was a lot to live up to, and was that weighing you down at all do you think?
all the work you put in in sweden, you get here to brisbane you see the sun and find yourself in the final. are you saying, i'm really glad i put in all that work, because now things are going well for me; this is where my game should be?
when you set your goals for 2013, where did reaching a final come on the list?
what about winning a final? where is that on the list?
you managed to pull it out. is your knee okay?
nothing serious?
do you have tendinitis there? is it chronic pain?
how do you feel like you're playing overall? obviously he's a good player.
there is a chance you could play andy murray in the next match. what would you feel going in against the us open champion?
you're 23 now. do you consider this year to be very big for you in your career?
do you feel like your game is where you want it to be? it is close?
knowing that rafa is not going to melbourne, does that put a bit of a spring in your step knowing there is one less of the big four there blocking everyone's path to potentially the semifinals?
you were saying that your serve has improved. is one of the things you're working on trying to be more offensive so you're not having to run all the time and playing defense a lot?
so do you think that your generation of players, dolgopolov, raonic, and tomic, maybe this year you guys can take the step where you can really challenge federer and nadal and djokovic and murray?
what do you think is separating them from you guys?
held your serve throughout. i guess that's a pretty good match if you don't get broken, i guess.
looked like a little bit ever frustration out there in the second set getting up to the tiebreaker. step us through that.
is it particularly bad at one end over the other? is it an issue of maybe they shouldn't be scheduled at that time?
given how much you play throughout the year for your lives, are you legitimately rusty going into every new season? do you feel like, oh, i haven't played in forever?
probably hurts quite a bit when you start playing matches again.
you played nishikori in melbourne?
that semi you played against novak last year in melbourne, how important was that as maybe the tipping point for your faith and a bit of confidence?
there was a little bit of grumbling before the australian open last year about the prize money and how it's allocated.
do you think the increase this year is going to make life a bit more comfortable for players ranked outside of the top 20?
do you think it'll encourage more people to stay on the tour for longer?
but the collective power of the players from the top down must be...
do you expect a realistic breakthrough from any of the younger players this year, like nishikori or raonic or tomic? i know there is a lot of talk about it year to year, but none of them have really made the big push like you and roger and rafa and novak did at more or less the same age or younger ages.
i heard that jez lost a versaclimber contest to lendl; is that right?
that's pretty amazing given lendl's age.
so they did a half hour on the versaclimber?
he's still pretty competitive, huh?
there were some quotes a while back about trying to tone down the language on the court maybe. is that going to plan?
now that you've won a major, does it feel like more after role model thing?
seemed that you played the best tennis of your career; do you agree?
yeah.
you looked very, very relaxed on the court. did something change in your mind during the offseason?
17 aces. you must be pretty happy about the serving.
do you sense with rafa not being here there may be some room to make a good leap this summer?
this time last year there was a lot of grumbling behind the scenes from the players about the prize money. the money in the australian open has been increased in the first couple rounds. do you think that's enough?
you're a young guy coming onto the scene. has there been players who you've been contemporaries with who could have made it on the tour who chose not to because it wasn't economically viable?
you have a chance now against marcos baghdatis in the semifinal. what are your thoughts on that match?
it's a bit hard to know what to make of that. john was obviously inspired. what's your take on that?
was that the first time you had heard his him is when you saw it in the draw?
what's it like for you playing against a hometown boy? do you just block it out?
you looked a bit uncomfortable at times. were you tightening up?
does it feel similar to last year? i think last year you had a close one.
are you meeting up with ivan here?
when was the last time you saw him?
does that make you more relieved that you won tonight if he's turning up tomorrow morning?
during the offseason, i was wondering, did you have a the chance to train with tsonga?
with nadal not coming here there maybe some opportunities for someone to sort of push towards this top four or five. is there anyone you can see that could make big bounds this summer?
well done, mate. was it everything you dreamed it would be out there?
you came out strong but the first set got away from you. what did you think going into the second set? what was the plan?
is that your best tennis? is that fair to say?
how much confidence do you take from taking a set off someone like him moving forward to when you meet someone of that rank again?
he's got an olympic gold medal, grand slam win, $5 million in the bank last year. realistically when you stepped on the court did you think you could win?
a match like that when you're pretty close with the best in the world, you'll sort of now go back and have a look at that game and say what are the little parts of my game i need to improve or maybe the parts of murray's game that got me?
is the coach gary stickler?
andy said that his homework revealed you had some character and you're a hard worker. how does that make you feel that the no.3 player in the world now knows this much about you?
what do you think of tomic's performance?
when you see that sort of result, so you see yourself beating those top players?
disappointing. just give us your thoughts about that. it was very tight.
you going to kooyong; is that right?
a little bit flatter than you were in the game the other night?
a little bit frustrating when you're physically in good nick and can't get the games you want?
going back the end of that second set where of it 45, 5all, and a break point, what did you think about then? you think about staying in the point or going for your shots?
i know you would have liked a chance to play andy here. i think you might get the chance in kooyong.
i think he may be. are you looking forward to playing those top guys at kooying just so you can measure yourself against those guys before you go to melbourne?
what did you make the bernard tomic getting a win over novak last night?
what else have you got out of this tournament apart from some competitive matches?
how did it feel in the middle of thatunfortunately second set when there seemed to be a bit of a comeback coming from you? did it feel like it was starting to come together at that point?
will you go to sydney for an couple days or straight to melbourne?
what do you think about your match and your tournament?
what was the solution?
did today's experience give you a deeper appreciation for just what it takes and how hard it is to get to the top 10 and stay there now that you've arrived?
do you think your final game would be easier with novak djokovic?
can you talk about your emotions this week, coming into the tournament with lower confidence, then you had to deal with the controversy with the del potro match, playing vasek in the semis, playing rafa in the finals. just your emotions this week.
yesterday you said if you made unforced errors, it was okay if the intentions were right. were they?
how was your first masters final? were you nervous before the game?
did you feel more pressure because of that standing ovation at the beginning?
there's a lot of talk about the difference between the top four and the top ten. is this match a reflection of that?
louis borfiga says canada will win a grand slam within five years.
of all of those things just outlined, which means the most to you? do they all mean something special?
vasek was just in here and he basically said he was emotionally spent after the whole week, but especially the match you just had. how emotionally are you after such a grueling match?
tomorrow is the final. who would you prefer to play with, rafa or djokovic, and why?
can you play out match point, what you remember, what you saw.
can you go through like if you're playing djokovic what the match is to be like, then nadal?
does your new coach have something to do with your success here?
what were your expectations before this week started and how do you feel today?
how intense were you in the second set? you served at 116. how tough was it to control your nerves at the end of the game?
75.
can you talk about the effect of the break you had between the second and third set. did that help you mentally to regroup?
was it a primal scream?
looking at the way djokovic and nadal are playing right now, low number of unforced errors. what can you do to minimize those errors between now and tomorrow?
the longest members of your team have been your parents, who have been sitting there front row. what did you get to share with them when you finally realized you were top 10, going to your first final?
many french players don't like to play you because they say you are a big server. what can you answer?
you can trust me, they say that.
looking back, growing up, were you a nadal guy or djokovic guy and why?
vasek is a top40 player right now, very few points to defend the rest of the season. can raonic/pospisil be a rivalry down the road in men's tennis?
you're going to be playing for davis cup in belgrade. what are your expectations for that?
how did you feel about the crowd being so behind vasek pospisil today?
you've played rafa three times. can you go through what it's like to play him?
do you feel any additional pressure playing here with all eyes on you or do you just treat it like any other atp 1000 event throughout the season?
can you balance the disappointment of the moment with the larger picture of how much you accomplished this week? is it still too soon to try to do that?
being on that court, as difficult as it seemed, looked like there were some nervous moments for you early and a little bit late.
because you have played milos so many times and you know him so well, do you feel like you were able to force his game? his second serve was 80 miles an hour down the stretch.
the handshake with milos, didn't seem to be many words exchanged. was it the emotion of the moment?
the emotions spilled over pretty strongly once you let it all out when it was done.
you're around 40 in the world. what does that mean to you?
you had such great momentum in the second set. there was about an eightminute layoff for the bathroom break. did that hurt your rhythm at all?
do you feel like this is the beginning of a rivalry, that you guys might start meeting in tournaments?
are you superstitious?
why?
wanted to look good for the cameras?
nutsandbolts question about next week. when are you going to cincinnati? it's simon in the draw. how do you feel about playing him? he had an injury he was dealing with here this week.
what did you learn about the stage, this moment, the grand stage, center court, at the semifinal level of a 1000?
can you take us through match point. you drive it to the corner, he gets across, hits a rocket. do you feel like it's a volley you should have made or was his shot too good?
you're from vernon, grew up there. you created a bit of buzz over the week. probably the greatest athletic achievement to come out of that town. are you aware of the interest and excitement you created back there?
so how would you sum up this week?
can you explain what happened on the particular point where milos won the point when you were at the net.
how can you explain that you were more nervous playing milos than you were about the moment?
you served very aggressive in the first game. you returned aggressively. you played the first couple points in the tiebreak aggressively. was it your plan to dictate early every chance you could get?
today you hit the forehand very aggressively, often down the line. i learned when you started playing tennis you hit it with two hands. how many years did it take for you to be comfortable attacking with one hand?
wasn't difficult for you to make the change?
what is it about the rivalry between you and novak that brings the best out of both of you?
the stadium was pretty loud tonight. can it be any louder tomorrow? were you at all bothered during the match today?
last time you met milos, it was on hard court in tokyo 2011. how will it be different this time, especially in front of his home crowd?
you've beaten him three times already. what is the key to beating him? does the serve cause you any trouble?
the first time you played milos, you won 64, 64. afterwards you had nice things to say about his game. did you think he would reach the top 10 so quickly?
when you played him, did you think he would be that high?
last time you were in the final in montral was 2005 against agassi. since that moment you've had some injuries. what do you think is the biggest change in your game since 2005?
in your game since you played agassi here.
what are some things you think you lost?
considering the very high level of tennis you played today, did you expect to play that well that quickly after the month off?
was that a little tougher than you thought it was going to be?
this has been the case all week: you got great support from the crowd. ernests seemed to feel they were a little unfavorable toward him. he might have gotten a rough ride from the crowd. did you feel that?
a couple key moments, you saved a couple set points in the first set, then 44 you saved the breakpoint. mentally how have you managed to get yourself righted?
did you feel in the third set that you were doing the things you wanted to do with the serve and volley, that you were putting the pressure on him?
we've been saying maybe that you'll face vasek for so long. now it's true. what is your feeling about it?
before your match began, pospisil was asked who he thought had the edge. he said, you've got to give the edge to milos, for sure. would you handicap that?
he gave the edge to you.
what can you say about your relationship with vasek? how much of a rivalry is there?
was there a bit of a rivalry back when you were playing at juniors?
has the historical significance of not just one but two canadians facing each other this deep in the tournament sunk in for you yet?
a dumb question because it's me.
is it hard to play after a guy hits four doublefaults and gives you a game?
i'm not very good with math, but can we figure out you only have three different colored shirts for this tournament?
i want a yes or no answer.
you have a chance to move into the top 10 with a win tomorrow. what is the importance of that?
you played a hard threesetter today while vasek only played three games. do you think the fatigue could be a factor tomorrow?
when is the first time you played vasek in juniors?
which of the two won?
he was a year older?
for your arm, was that something that bothered you today or not at all?
same as the last match?
any inkling at all something like this was going to happen, from the warmup or body language?
it's got to be good for you.
you were talking about the fatigue, difficult schedule.
it's such a big payday. we think about athletes. everyone thinks they're rich and wealthy; they can do whatever they want. maybe it's too soon to start thinking about it, but it's a lot of money. certainly it's got to help fund your career for the next year. is that fair to say?
the other bonus is the points that go with it. all of a sudden top 50, possibility of even going higher.
you'll probably get into cincinnati, as well.
is that in your plans now?
you did get the special exempt?
there's a lot of people that don't understand how the atp points system works. my understanding is that if you're in the top 45 or 50, that changes everything, automatically into the masters events. for laymen that don't understand what the difference is between being in the top 50 and the rest of the world, can you elaborate?
if you have to play milos tomorrow, what will that do for you tenniswise and emotionalwise?
how much have you been on the court against each other? have you ever played a match against him?
who has the edge?
have you thought far enough ahead, if you reach the finals, about possibly winning the tournament?
last week or even a couple weeks ago, had someone told you you're going to win in vancouver, then make your first semifinal in a masters 1000, enter the top 50, what would you have said?
what has changed in your game the last couple weeks, or has anything changed for your game?
do you remember the last time a canadian won this tournament?
33 years before you were born.
if you play milos tomorrow, who do you think the crowd is going to cheer for?
is it tough for you to realize what is happening to you?
what will be your schedule today?
you might be playing raonic next round.
you were talking about your goal of being top 50. it might even be top 40 now. have you realized this or is it all happening too fast?
in english you were talking about the money you will receive. apparently it's a lot. can you tell us how much?
there's a lot of talk about you playing milos. if it was gulbis, do you know him?
was there a rivalry always between you and milos?
did you see the cincinnati draw? do you know whether you will be in the main draw or whether you have to play the quallies?
very interesting match, exciting. at the end it's a loss for you. what is your feeling right now?
what was it like with the atmosphere? fans were booing you.
when the crowd turned on you, did it affect you at all?
is it pretty much the only place where you see that?
have other players talked about this or is this something unique you're finding?
it was a good week for you. can you build on that for the next tournament?
can you tell us what happened out there?
so you were feeling sick before the match?
do you feel you should feel better by next week?
what were the symptoms?
have you changed any of your goals over the past week?
you have a top 10 and top 20 win. the next guys are 44 and 83.
in the tiebreak, what emotions are you going through there?
athletes often say when things are going well that the game slows down. at what pace do you feel you're playing at right now?
the crowd was electric. what did you think?
you were talking the other day about the technical improvements in your game. what about the game between your ears? to get to the level where the top players are, so much of it is not necessarily the groundstrokes but being composed in the right moments. you've been very good at that.
how tough was it to manage your energy when you play a guy who only played two sets in the whole tournament, you played quite a while? did you feel a breakdown in your energy?
from your point of view, what happened with the underhand serve?
you seemed pretty disbelieving at the end of the match. how do you feel now? has it sunk in?
are you going to go watch a bit of the match now to see who you're going to play?
a lot of expectations were there for milos at the beginning. people didn't know you as much. seems like you're the story of the tournament now. how does it feel? do you feel this is your week that people will remember you now?
how would you rate this victory and the whole week in general?
where do you find all the confidence? how can you explain it?
sometimes you were asking the crowd to support you. was it very important for you?
what are you most proud of?
how is your energy level right now?
but if you're tired, it also means you've been playing a lot of tennis.
good victories on hard courts. congratulations.
what is tough about that opponent?
next you have matosevic. he's been doing very good lately.
boris becker years ago used to talk about the future of tennis and used to say that eventually the sport would be dominated by guys the size of jerzy, very tall guys. it hasn't happened. the best players now are still guys your size. when you see a guy play like he does and moves pretty well for a man his size, do you think that's a possibility as athletes continue to get bigger, stronger, taller?
do you feel when you play a long match against a player who is taller, that the longer the match goes, because of your movement, that you can grind them down a little bit?
with everything you've been able to accomplish, then roger's career rsum, novak, and andy, 20 years from now, how do you think this era in men's tennis will be perceived?
to be doing what you're doing against this type of opponent, you appreciate it a little bit more knowing you're going against roger federer, one of the alltime greats?
do you appreciate what you've been able to accomplish knowing how strong the field is, especially at the top?
some of the players have complained the ball is different at this tournament. has it affected your game at all or your strategy?
do you have any power to change that? does the player's union try to get together? how do they determine what ball to use?
what is your complaint about the ball exactly?
in terms of your objectives for 2013, is reaching no.1 at the end of the season still something you believe you can achieve? is that high on your priority list?
how do you analyze your match? obviously disappointed, or...
over the last three years you have enjoyed a lot of success in other tournaments, but not in canada. is it something maybe a bit of a slow start of the summer season? does it bother you or it's just normal because you want to peak at the us open?
wimbledon was pretty emotional for you. was it hard to get back to training? is it something that could have played in this game, to start your training again afterwards?
you've talked about how you don't have the experience of coming in as the defending champion. this will be the first time at the us open. have you had time to think about how the motivation is different this time where you have more confidence versus maybe the hunger you had before when you hadn't done it yet?
were you happy about your game in practice earlier this week and this was just a bad day?
you played well today. a tough loss. do you take any positives from this? do you feel your game was in good shape today?
you also had to play in front of some intense crowds yesterday with the canadians, similar to the atmosphere at wimbledon. does any of that get to you at all? how does that motivate you?
if you compare yesterday's crowd to the crowd you had back in miami earlier this season, how does it compare?
when you were up 3love in the second set, what do you think turned the momentum? what was the turning point there?
part of what people like about your game is you're honest on and off the court. do you find any challenges with that? do you mind showing emotion on the court?
they've given you the nickname the polverizer. do you like that that?
because your pole, and pulverize means one extreme to the next.
where would this win rate in your career?
that was one of the more calmer matches you've played in a while. is that because the crowd was flat or was that your intention to remain calm?
energywise.
what would you say was the biggest difference between this match and the other times you played murray, other than the fact you won?
what is the difference between you now and your game at the beginning of the season?
a lot of the players complain about the balls here in montral. what do you think about that?
you said you had lower expectations at the beginning. now what are your expectations for the rest of the tournament?
from experience, you've beaten top players before. a win like this, you can capitalize on the confidence. is it something you tend to get a lot from, the confidence in a match like this?
would you rather be a seeded player at the us open or a dangerous unseeded floater in the draw?
it appeared you were having some trouble with your serve. was that the conditions or just an off day?
what was it like with the atmosphere playing against with the home support or are you used to that?
pospisil is 23. a lot of the veterans on the tour don't know him so well. what did you learn about his game in the match today?
the underhand serve you did, what was going on? was it the referee? was it the crowd? was it the attitude of the match?
what is the rule?
michael chang won a french open that way.
was it because it was too fast after the time violation?
do you feel that was better than last night?
what did you feel was working tonight that wasn't working last night?
tried to keep them short?
a lot of players complained about the conditions, but especially about the balls here. do you have anything to say about it?
and about the wind, how did it affect your game today?
what do you do during a rain delay to stay focused?
nothing special?
any interesting conversations?
this is a match you've been waiting for for a while. your last couple matches haven't been up to your standard obviously.
anything helpful about him being a very good opponent compared to some other guys you played recently?
did you feel at any point any pressure to finish this as the clouds were getting darker?
you and vasek have moved on to the third round. what does this say about the state of canadian tennis as a whole?
it's still early, but you could face del potro in the next round. you've mentioned this new style, aggressive style. you're trying that because you want to beat the top players. are you looking forward or maybe cheering for del potro to win that match so you can test it?
bleu, blanc, rouge in montral means something, their colors. we have rouge, bleu. should we expect blanc tomorrow?
any reason for the blue tonight?
you won in red last night. why would you change a winning combination?
pretty solid first set. a few loose service games in the second set. were you surprised you were able to pass him as much as you did?
can you talk a little bit about having that homecourt advantage, what that does for you.
yesterday's match was an epic win. today's was more routine. as a player, is routine better, better for your psyche? great players win these matches and move on to the next ones.
both days we've seen the fist pumps, a lot of very expressive stuff. tell us how emotion helps fuel your game. give us some context.
what is the line between that and sportsmanship issues?
from a win in b.c. to 71 with a bullet, first time in the third round, where do you think your game has progressed that you've seen the results come in?
is there any one stroke that has really turned around or marginal improvements in all of them?
you had a late start of the season with health problems. do you feel it was some sort of advantage?
do you want to give your coach a plug?
you were losing 25 in the final set. you came back to 45. were you concerned at that time?
what can you say about the success of the canadian players and about the work that tennis canada has been doing?
your ranking has gone up 18 places. you're in the third round. it can possibly even go higher. maybe you will be a top 60 player now. how do you explain this improvement and what is your goal as far as rankings are concerned?
you were saying that tennis canada helped you to find a coach. how much help did they give you?
you lost a lot of weight. you said 10 pounds. is it your new coach who decided what you should eat, who told you you were eating a poor diet?
all the victories lately, do they have an influence on how you feel on the court?
even though you lost that match, do you take a lot of confidence out of that one?
two weeks ago you were playing against 300, 400 ranked players in the world. now you're playing with players ranked 60. how did you feel playing with these guys?
when you fell in the third set, did you hurt yourself?
when do you feel as a player that you are competing at the same level with somebody that's so much higher ranked than you and you could just as easily win a match like that? does it happen during a rally? when do you sense, hey, i'm as good as this guy?
how did you like your whole experience here?
both had to be cautious in the wind. maybe you were more aggressive than he was. what was the whole thing about how you swing out and how careful did you have to be?
anything especially tricky about his game?
he didn't seem to have a weapon.
from now on do you feel you can play with these guys all the time?
do you think the gods were with you yesterday when you made the reflex volley, then today the net cord on the breakpoint?
the wind, too.
was that a volley or a regular groundstroke?
any sense of the people who were watching getting free on that one end? that stand is out in the park and anyone can walk in.
can you tell us a little about the conditions today. they were pretty difficult with the wind and everything.
first match since wimbledon. happy with the way everything went?
every player seems to complain about the balls year after year. different ball used at the us open, for example. why don't the players do something about it? can you do something about it?
has anything changed for you since winning wimbledon?
royal baby take some pressure off you?
now that you're heading into this part of the season as the defending us open champion, has that changed your preparations at all, or are you treating it as you would any other year?
how was it?
conditions make it different from last time or something else as well?
what is the rafa experience like?
nine doublefaults to one. disappointing for you?
at what point can you look back and say that you didn't have such a bad week?
general question about canadian tennis. tying a record of having five canadians in the second round. part of history.
being part of a cool trivia question.
you mentioned the us open. how different will that be this year, not being an american but being a canadian?
what kind of helmet?
how did you like your experience here as a canadian?
what exactly happened with the elbow? has it been an issue?
right elbow?
do you know what the problem is?
for years they're saying the players at the top are going to get bigger and bigger. we've seen some bigger guys come in. the dominant guys are roughly still around 6'1", 6'2". do you foresee a time when the game is dominated by guys 6'5", 6'6"?
somebody said all the points were decided by you; either you made or missed the shot. do you think that was accurate?
you just said you felt awful. you or because of the conditions?
you're playing against nadal tomorrow. your thoughts on that?
big difference in the scores of the first set and the last two sets. was it due to your own performance?
after the pertussis, were you able to have rest and are you fit again?
so where do you have pain right now? you have your ribs and the cough. anything else?
how were your spirits during the period where you couldn't do anything?
is it all coming back quickly? it's been two weeks since you started playing again.
what hurts for the time being?
what are you going to do after this tournament?
can you tell us a bit more about the match today.
how did you break your ribs?
what are you the most pleased about?
is it difficult at times to stick to it? change is never easy.
when you look at the success of the canadian players today, topranked male, any nervousness today?
do you feel pressure to be mostly the best top canadian player at the moment?
you and novak practiced together. are you expecting a match with him? do you have any tactics for that possible match?
maybe in this tournament.
there are chances.
you have a lot of points to defend over the next couple weeks. is it more important to get this new style down?
basically just be more aggressive, take more advantage of your net play?
even though you're a seeded player, you're getting a top30 player in the second round. talk about the tough road you've had so far.
what do you remember about the youzhny match at the australian?
the gonzlez crowd four years ago, any similarity tonight?
it was a great serving match tonight. how did you manage to get love40 in the last game of the match? he was serving well all game long.
was it a big advantage to serve first in the third set?
a difficult start to the season. do you feel back in your element being back on the hard courts?
anybody tell you that isner never loses a tiebreaker?
how do you feel about your game in general? is this the kind of match you expected?
was it wilson out there?
what did you like best about the win today?
i was thinking you might mention a comeback and fighting spirit down 41.
it's four players in the second round from canada for the first time since 1992. a thought on canadian tennis.
can you describe the emotional rollercoaster from the beginning till the end.
i was standing beside nestor when it was 4all in the tiebreak. he said you picked the service return. was he right?
there is some thinking going on inside your head?
is this the biggest win of your career?
what do you think this day means for canadian tennis? was there a change of attitude in the last few years? a few years ago nobody would have thought you would have four or five players.
in the third set at 41, knowing how good a server he is, what were you feeling in that moment?
how is your level of energy after what happened to you these past days, then winning your matches in montral?
what is happening to canadian tennis? there are four of you in the second round, and milos is up in his match.
how do you explain that?
can you describe the feeling you had after winning the match against a top player?
can you talk about your next opponent.
you and vasek have czech origins. do you speak czech together?
are you going to celebrate tonight?
can you just go back a couple of days. i assume you were preparing to play the qualifying matches. when did you learn you received the wild card?
who is your coach?
can you describe how it is to win your first match of the rogers cup?
you were talking about consistency. you struggled with that in the first part.
did you notice a big difference from him once he got injured?
a quick statement about how happy you are about that win.
what is your goal for the end of the year? did you set yourself a goal?
how did you start playing tennis when you were young? family or...
what age?
how has the transition been? looks like there's been a few down moments along the way.
can you talk about the decision to have your game on court no.5?
do you feel like it helped you in any way to play in a smaller court?
your plans for the rest of the year change now that your ranking has come up?
you got a shot at the quallies at the us open?
maybe a few words about your next match. how much do you know about istomin?
do you expect to be looser or tighter?
what was the biggest adjustment from junior to pro?
can you say exactly what happened on the match point? was it a backhand or forehand?
just reflex?
you did the splits at least twice today.
looked like you had trouble getting up from one of them today.
how much time do you spend now on strength work?
happy with the way you're playing?
four canadians in the second round, one more possibly tonight. what does that say about canadian tennis right now?
you felt you could be a top 100 player again. does a win like this reinforce that?
what will this do for your confidence because you've been doing quite well lately?
you all play davis cup together as a team. here you're here as individuals. do you still feel like a team with vasek and milos?
what do you think about your next opponent?
you had lost your last three matches here in the rogers cup. is it good to finally win one here? what made the difference today?
you've been improving your level of game lately. is there anything special that made it happen?
there are four canadian players in the second round in this tournament. is it good?
is it good to show that in canada there is not only milos who can play well?
your next match will be janowicz. you played him last year. what is the key to beat him?
this match had ups and downs. you were up 42 in the third set. did you feel you were controlling the match at that stage?
what happened in the end of the match?
but lately you had very good results in doubles. does that help?
we have louis in canada, he was your coach. what can you tell us about him?
and why should they do so now?
what can you tell us about murray's victory in wimbledon? how was that victory perceived among the players?
he said he got more messages after this victory than after his us open victory or anything else he did in his career.
do you believe he can keep it going and keep the momentum going?
only a tiny bobble at the end.
being the world no.1, do you think sort of keeping players like this in their place, winning, cuts down on their confidence by winning against them?
down 42, what was going through your mind? what were you thinking in that first set?
you mentioned on the court you would support this tournament becoming a 1000.
can you talk a bit more about that.
winning on a very fast court like this against someone like tomas, that must give you quite high hopes going into indian wells where it's not quite as fast. do you feel that will suit your game even better?
shanghai is the best atp 1000 tournament in the last four years, so can you compare these two tournaments?
shanghai.
yeah.
you have won four titles here in the last five years, a dominance akin to australia. how does that feel and where does it rank in your career achievements?
no, here, winning four out of five here. how does it fit and where does it rank?
do you think it's a match that you could have won, especially with the break up in the first set?
where do you feel you came up short?
up 42, you had a couple volley chances that you missed, and it seemed like that's where, if it was a weakness today, it was the volleys. i mean, your serve was on, your forehand was good, when you came to the net you had a couple of chances that looked like...
you said yesterday you were going to do some homework and try and come up with a plan, and in the first set is looked really close and it looked like you were almost the better player through most of it. what do you feel you did well in the first set that you could build on?
he mentioned on court that he would like this tournament to become a 1000. is that something you would encourage? do you think it could be a regular fixture every year as a 1000?
how sort of mentally and psychologically draining is it when someone like novak starts to put the pressure on anybody's serve and makes you play the next ball, the next ball, the next ball? it must be quite difficult to cope with.
i mean, what about the pressure? you know, you beat federer yesterday. it would have been the first tournament where you beat the top two in the same tournament. was that at all an issue as you were going i mean, was there any point when just the pressure got to you?
one of those matches where you had a lot of chances but it didn't work out.
tomas has had a lot of good wins against the top four guys. what is it about his game that makes him particularly difficult?
you talked yesterday about concentration. in the tiebreak you actually had a chance to serve it out, but was it nerves or was that concentration? you looked nervous.
at 21, roger, in the final set, the energy seemed to just drain away just for that moment. was that a crucial part of the match?
overall, what parts of your game are you happy with?
i have a very quick question about football. i know you're an fc basel fan. there is an egyptian player, mohamed salah. have you noticed him yet?
you had the bobble again.
overall how did you feel about coming through like you did?
do you always feel you can raise your game at any time, for instance, like in the tiebreak or towards the end of that second set?
juan martin obviously got angry about the time violation he was given, and it came after quite a long rally and on break point. did you feel it was unfair?
berdych made a point about bringing a clock onto court, a clock right there so everyone can see what's going on with the time. do you think that's a good idea?
do you think though that time violation was a key factor in the second set kind of defining moment that, you know, allowed you to break?
congratulations on making the final. you either play berdych or federer. can you walk us through each matchup separately?
you must be very pleased with that.
what were you thinking when you were down those match points?
what is it about your game that he finds difficult? because you have beaten him five out of the last eight.
in marseilles you had match point against tsonga. did you think about that during the tiebreak?
you mentioned the crowd. does it give you any extra incentive when all the crowd is rooting for the person on the other side?
are you envious of the adulation that he gets wherever he goes?
are you envious of the adulation that he gets everywhere, everyone is rooting...
how does it feel to play djokovic in the final?
what makes djokovic so tough for you?
it's 121, but your win did come on the fast surface at wimbledon.
you have had a lot of matches in the last couple of weeks, threesetter tonight. how are you feeling physically? are you in perfect shape, do you think?
you looked very sharp tonight. were you happy with that?
how easy is it to beat someone continually, 19 out of 21 victories over nikolay, but to continually beat them? does it play in your head?
talking about matchups, you're up against berdych who has beaten you in a couple of big matches, most recently the us open. how do you approach that? your thoughts?
i read that you had given your support to the olympic bid of squash. is that the case? and if so, what is it that you like about that sport?
has it contributed to your tennis in any way, maybe retrieving on the forehand side?
nikolay talked last night about with age he's started to struggle a bit with concentration over longer games. is that something you've noticed, or do you actually get bored towards the end of matches, especially when they tend to run away? like tonight's went very quickly, yeah?
no latematch bobble this time?
no letdown today?
was this a little bit of i mean, after yesterday, was there some frustration you were taking it out on the court?
you did well in abu dhabi in december. you won. and now you're doing well in dubai. uae is obviously working well for you.
andy murray said a couple years ago that he wanted to focus on grand slams, that that's where he wanted to play his best.
but he said last year that he thought maybe that was a mistake, that he should always go out withhis best in every tournament. is that your attitude? every tournament the same?
roger was talking about his outfit yesterday. do you have any input on your outfit?
can you talk about that?
of course.
it lacks pink.
you have to follow federer.
lots of things have been happening in the world of sport, like pistorius and before that was, you know, lance armstrong and tiger woods before that. it's left the sports fan wondering whether they know their champion. you've always advocated a close relationship between the fan and the athlete. can you talk a little about that and how much of an athlete, the champion, that the fans must know?
i guess you'd like to play him every week, wouldn't you?
do you welcome an easy match like that?
when i talked to him, he said that it was a hamstring, that he was having a hard time moving, just what you're saying. in terms of even despite that, how do you feel about your play in this match? do you feel you're ready for somebody like federer next round?
assuming it is roger, i believe since 2010 you have beaten him four times and roger has only beaten you three and you have inflicted some painful defeats upon him: wimbledon, us open last year. you know, what have you done to get that recent record against him? is it more aggression? is it more power? have you bullied him?
serious question we should get over first: did you have any input into the design of your pink shoes?
certainly can see you coming, anyway?
your timing seemed a lot sharper today. was that down to calm conditions or your opponent's style of play or just...
davydenko is next. do you feel that he's not already the same guy as he was in 2011?
his game is different than the two players that you've already played. do you feel that you can adjust somehow to that? do you need to change your game?
just going back to the shoes and the attire, i mean, you're obviously a guy that takes a little bit of care about your appearance when you go out and stuff like that. nike runs everything past you. have there been many times where you said, no, i don't think so? and if you had to look back, what is your favorite outfit? i remember a few at wimbledon, long pants and blazer and stuff.
you're already thinking what you're going to wear at wimbledon next year?
you're something of a traditionalist. would you like it if people just wore white?
you have always i believe, anyway, you've always maintained the focus on you and sort of the top four. with that in mind, what do you make of the fact that a qualifier and a wildcard are in the last eight, daniel brands and dmitry tursunov?
so you had quite a lot of trouble from him in the first set and early in the second. how did you turn it around and why was it so tough?
last week we see in the women's draw a lot of the women, particularly serena and victoria, pull out given that they had backtoback tournaments, doha and then here. you have obviously come straight from marseilles. how are you feeling physically?
how are you feeling after coming straight from marseilles?
you obviously did well to save you saved 12 of 14 break points. talk about that. he put you under pressure, but when it mattered you were able to get the job done.
after a couple of matches and like getting used to the conditions, is dubai a place that you like to play in? are you okay with the surface and everything? does it suit your game?
you said in your interview on court that you didn't you know, finding your rhythm, haven't perhaps found your best tennis here as yet. you're into the quarterfinals. how big a threat are you now to the rest of the draw?
when could you get your new outfit from h&m?
you still keep the shoe contract with nike?
you also talked you were asked on court about the new timing rule. getting used to it? what's your thoughts on it? do you think it's the right way to go?
so you feel in the tournaments you have played this year it's been inconsistent? sometimes it's been abided by the clock and sometimes not? is it fair to say it's been inconsistent?
how many warnings did you get today? just two?
one only?
that was a good way to start, wasn't it?
how difficult is it to keep playing your friend viktor so many times? you know him well.
with the courts being so quick, does that affect the tactics you're adopting during the tournament?
second set got a little tricky. he broke you.
but then you quickly broke back.
just looking at the present generation of serbian players yourself, viktor, janko, and in the women, jankovic, ivanovic there doesn't seem to be as much young talent coming through behind you now. why do you think that is?
but do you think there might be less hunger from those players because there is the system which you didn't really have?
does that mean they still have to go outside of serbia like you did and ana did?
is that even close, the national tennis center?
close friends. two points that you did tonight. do you think your friendship is over the winning, the victory, the money, the points of the ranking?
obviously, novak, another close friend of yours, janko tipsarevic, became the first seed to drop out of competition. he seems out of sorts, pulled out of davis cup. is that a concern? especially for serbia in the davis cup.
so why the slow start?
how did you manage to turn it around?
surviving a match like that or coming through a match like that, first round, does that give you confidence going forward?
you've got a very good record here, two finals. why do you think you play so well here? is it something about the place you like?
in davis cup you play against britain in april. how important will that be for russia? you have had many years in the world group.
andy murray will not play. would you expect to be the favorites to win that?
have you ever been to coventry?
you play daniel brands next round, german qualifier. have you ever played daniel before, or what are you expecting?
there's no injuries? because of the delay, was there an injury that you had?
you have just given me the answer. we thought that maybe because of the delay...
something minor?
well done on the breakthrough victory against paulhenri mathieu, your first victory against him in four attempts. what do you think you did well today or better from before? what was the key?
i think you fought off four break points in the first game on return. you know, when you start a match off like that and his serve seems to set the ball, and it was, that must give you confidence throughout the match.
he had knee surgery and then took a long break to recover. do you feel like he's the same player like before?
you mentioned it's your first win here in the main draw. are you relieved?
i think you meet either the winner of rosol and viola next. can you talk a little bit about your next matchup of those two players?
you just celebrated your 29th birthday last week. you achieved your best career ranking last month. if we can call you a late bloomer, do you think that's reasonable?
do you feel your life maybe change a little bit after becoming a top20 player?
before you came in, we were discussing about how you are italian but your mother language is german.
what's the official answer for that?
how did it go for you? you started really well.
what did you think when you saw the draw?
how difficult was it to bring that first set where you played superbly well, wonderful hitting, into the second set? because obviously then roger took control.
was it more of a fitness situation?
did you feel that there was a lot of support in the stands? did that help?
the ministry of sport in tunisia said you cannot play in dubai because you are injured. what do you think?
looking ahead, does this match give you confidence in building back your fitness and getting back to playing matches?
do you think you are not lucky to play the first match against federer?
did that seem a bit like deja vu, sort of struggling a bit at the beginning of this tournament and coming through?
is there often a balance to be struck to wanting to play freely at the beginning and playing pragmatic so you survive?
you said yesterday you expected a tricky encounter because you had never played him. what was it about his game and what did you change in the second and third that made the difference?
is there any part of his game that's impressed you? he's coming back from injury and hasn't played in three months. did you know that going in?
we see players have different opinions with regards to whether a tough match is good for them in terms of the tournament. where do you feel with respect to that? and specifically with these events, are you happy you had a tough firstup match?
can you put your present player council hat on and explain why this tournament has won best tournament at this level nine times out of the last ten years?
can i just have a followup question after that? shanghai won the atp 1000 award for four years in a row. so what makes things with shanghai stand out from other masters tournaments?
a nadal question. a couple weeks ago in south america he said more doping tests, more transparency, but he also evidently in spanish said something like not only should there be more tests but they should be revealing the results on a rolling basis every week, who was tested, what happened. do you think that's a logical idea?
can you talk a little about the conditions out there, how it was to play? windy?
the first set you lost just two points on your serve. was that one of your best serving days?
coming to this match, you'd won just one set off him. you have played him twice before. what was going through your mind the first match? you have been on a good run.
starting of this new association that you have started, can you comment on something?
with so much going on now back home, how do you disconnect yourself? because this is a whole new phase for you coming back and you have been playing well. how do you disconnect yourself from...
mahesh bhupathi came out and said the association back home may have won the battle but have not won the war, and if they think so they are smoking some good crack. but what's the next step? is it a boycott? how do you escalate it so that they take you more...
there has been sort of infighting in indian tennis, rumbling going on since the olympics. why is it continuing on?
going back to the tournament, baghdatis or del potro next. any preferences?
he came out so strong. he's won games against you before, but when he started that strongly, how did you feel?
i know you say that you felt you were not the favorite with the time you had spent out of the game. but does it hurt to finally lose here after so long?
will you have enough time between now and roland garros to get the energy levels up to what you need to retain the title?
the second set 42, chance to serve for the set at 65, was it just physical or were you nervous or was there something else?
it's a little bit strange. you won on hard court and novak djokovic lost. today you lost on clay and djokovic won. how do you see that?
when you were one break up, you lost your serve 43 at 15. when you were 65, you lost your set to love. then on the three points of the tiebreaker, you lost three out of four. do you think the serve also wasn't helping you enough maybe in terms of percentage? i'm asking, in these moments was the serve somehow important?
can you explain what you still feel is difficult in djokovic's game regarding your game, what are the issues when you're facing him?
in some player's game you have something that is more difficult than other ones.
you had the breaks in the second set, but he returned really well. is it disappointing to lose, because you did play well the second set, that makes it more disappointing to lose because it could have gone to a third set and been a different ballgame?
if you take out grand slams, this must rank pretty highly among the other tournaments you would have won, i would have thought?
having started so well, obviously had the momentum from the outset, how difficult is it to sustain that kind of level against someone like that when you know at some stage he's bound to start to play?
after 25 minutes, 5love up against nadal on clay, you said yesterday about a positive mindset, what was it you told yourself to do before this match?
also in the second set when he broke you, did you have the sensation that the match depended on you?
knowing that only three players have won 6love set versus nadal on clay in their life, when you beat nadal who won eight times this tournament, is like to beat federer in wimbledon, same sort of level? have you ever played a game like you played when you were down 65, those four winners, to win a love game?
you looked very emotional after the match point. can you share what you were thinking and what this win could mean for the weeks to come?
can we say this is a symbolic victory for you?
what makes you to take this decision? you said this is the best decision you ever took.
this is one trophy you've wanted for a very long time. the other one which you want probably more than any other would be the french open. i guess the two could be connected.
a lot of the game is the mental side of the game. players before they play nadal say, i have nothing to lose. you don't have that attitude. you say you want to win. if you approach him with that steely mentality, do you think it may intimidate him?
i know every time you win a trophy or you lose a trophy you're very polite with rafa. but winning this trophy and breaking the record of rafa makes this win something a little bit more special.
when you started the match, it seemed like you had a very good game plan, playing to his backhand. he tried to get your backhand, but you would run around and hit your forehand. is that a game plan?
you were very close to a perfect match with two good sets, then a loss of concentration at 51.
how did you feel your game today compared to yesterday? do you feel your finding your best rhythm?
are you happy to play against djokovic again?
last 10 matches against him have all been finals. you won the last three. he won the seven before that. is it still a special feeling playing against him?
how much have you watched of novak's matches this week?
in the past years federer/nadal was the biggest rivalry. last year since you were injured, federer was 30, so on, they started to say murray/djokovic could be the new rivalry. do you see yourself putting up a rivalry with you and djokovic as good as the one you had with federer or it's impossible that can happen?
do you think the emotions tomorrow will be just a little different because you, as you said earlier this week, are finding your way a little bit after your comeback, and he's been troubled with his ankle, and he's finding his way a little bit? do you think it will be a slightly more cagey match tomorrow?
i am not saying it's a comparison necessarily. he's talked all week about struggling with his movement. you talked about not feeling your game is quite there yet.
what is the key when playing djokovic on clay or anywhere?
you played djokovic 15 times in finals. which is for you the most memorable of these finals?
the most memorable, what you remember best.
but you lost.
i suppose you expected more from you today than the result. was it because of you? was it because of the weather? was it because of djokovic?
do you feel he's at his full physical shape?
you just played him, so i ask him?
you had the trainer come with the tape and the spray. what was wrong?
were you upset with the crowd booing you when you left the court?
if you had to put some money on the finals tomorrow, who do you pick?
today was a difficult match for you. overall you must be very proud of your tournament.
you already won the title of the shortest match in this tournament. the question is, do you like it, because it was not really a test for a tough match which you will have tomorrow?
we asked rafa if he was looking forward to playing you. he said, no, i'd rather play somebody easier. what is your feeling on the other half of that?
15th match in a final against him, which is incredible. what makes it so special to play against him?
fabio, you knew him since children. did you expect him to do more? did you think after the week he had it was normal because of inexperience that he had that he had like that? he said serbians are more hard working because they are not so spoiled as some italians who always have the mama behind them. i would like to know a comment from you on that.
yes.
we asked fabio about your physical problems. he answered with a big smile and he said, he beat me in 52 minutes. what physical problems? i want to know is the ankle problem an old story or not?
is the ankle story an old problem?
can you talk about the conditions of play, how it could influence the game tomorrow?
going back to the 100% commitment you need to be at the top. you were very close to the top at no.4, stayed there for a while. is that what you're talking about, that extra commitment?
it might have been said before the ultimate test in tennis was roger federer on grass. now they might say it's novak djokovic on hard courts. would you say the ultimate is rafael nadal on clay?
you said about 100% commitment. fabio was saying he was a bit injured because he played football tennis with his coach before the match. do you think that's eccentric, part of the charm of sport, or do you think that's bizarre before your biggest ever match?
of the 15 finals you played against rafa, which is the most memorable for you?
have you surprised yourself by being able to go deep after the ankle or did you think if you could get through the first match...
obviously it was a very tough day for you today. can you say why?
do you think dimitrov has the potential to get to the top 10 soon?
if you were his coach, what would be your remarks about his game?
you made more unforced errors than usual. for any reason?
but maybe tomorrow you have to play two good sets to beat tsonga.
you say maybe you're missing a bit of intensity. you still have your fighting qualities.
you had some tape on your back. any issue there?
can you talk about how nervous or tense you were 4all in the third set?
what will you need to do to beat tsonga tomorrow?
the only time you played tsonga on clay, you beat him easily. is it an advantage or not?
there were people who say that dimitrov has the style of federer. what do you think? people are thinking there will be another rivalry.
21, 22.
you played the first set well. in the second set, it seemed like your level wasn't the same.
was it complicated today?
you were not able to hit many winners.
did you believe you would do better today?
that set point when you were 5all or 56?
and what about the crowd?
didn't you have the impression they were slightly in favor of fognini?
what do you have to say about his game?
what was your level of fitness for that match?
are you paying for the great number of matches you played, more than 30?
do you believe it's wiser not to play barcelona?
it's not really your concern, but what do you think of the match between jo and rafa?
what about that passing shot on the set point that you played right into his racquet?
were you ready to play three sets?
you must be delighted with that performance.
what was the key today?
do you think it's true to say it is the biggest moment of your career so far?
you live not far from here. so you have all the fans, family and friends. it must have been very special. is it different from other matches?
do you think maybe gasquet was not 100% today or do you think he was at his top?
you looked sharp today.
before the tournament you were worried you couldn't even play. now you're on the verge of another final.
can you cast your mind back to playing rafa in the french open final last year and perhaps commenting when that match was over we wouldn't see him again for seven months, and back now we think of you as a big challenger for rafa in the clay court season.
i think you've never lost to fognini. first masters semifinal for him. what do you expect?
everybody has to play injured, misses some time. for rafa's comeback after seven months away from the game, lost one match since he's come back, are you surprised by that?
reflecting on the decision you made to play here, having gotten a few matches under your belt, could this be a very good decision for you to have come here and got some matches?
rafa was watching you playing your first round the other day. is it a special rivalry still going on between both of you?
what were you thinking in the tiebreak when he sat down and talked to the chair? was that a bit annoying?
didn't interrupt your rhythm?
you were the oldest player on the court, but the freshest and fittest.
in the third set he got the break early. what was your mindset at that point?
what about djokovic? pretty quick turnaround.
is it going to make some headlines in your country, such a good win?
are you surprised you're getting such good results with more maturity? is that helping you, having more experience being on the tour for a while?
do you look at players like tommy haas, maybe david ferrer, does that give you belief that maybe some of your best tennis is ahead of you?
it was maybe a little bit tougher today than yesterday or did you feel as comfortable out there as you did the first match?
when you are coming back onto clay, what is the most important first thing you have to have in your game? what is the most important element to stepping back onto the clay?
i'm probably asking the wrong person. but if you are having not such a good time on clay, is it a difficult surface to get your mind and your game back because you have to think of so many more intricate parts?
you didn't play for seven, eight months. how would you compare your state of mind to last year and the year before? are you more relaxed, more fresh, more excited to play?
what do you think about meeting dimitrov the next round?
as you know, wawrinka just beat andy. what do you think of stan's game?
this is generally your first clay court tournament of the year. do you feel in a way the benefits of having played three clay court events this year?
difficult to know what to make of it. 2love, you started so well. what was your reading of it from there?
looking over your career, this first week on clay is always one of the hardest weeks for you.
any thoughts on why specifically you were making those mistakes today?
how much does it bother you to lose a match in this way?
what is the main thing after a match like this you need to correct immediately in your game?
what part of your game did wawrinka expose today?
or that you felt weaker on?
were you a little disappointed you weren't able to get yourself pumped from the side of the court, energize yourself at any stage? sometimes you get yourself back into things by getting yourself into it.
everyone has bad days. was this just a bad day?
do you think it will be any concern going into madrid being undercooked in terms of match play, considering you're not playing barcelona?
where will that practice be and who will you practice with?
with this defeat, you drop to no.3. any significance to that at all?
are you happy not only with the victory but the way you played in this match?
there were two key moments in that match. at 5all 40love for you, and he came back to deuce, but you managed to make it. and then at 3all in the second set.
what about fognini next round?
how can you explain that the past two matches you played against him, he was able to make only four games?
is it going to be an allitalian match from the supporters' side, because you had some italian supporters today.
you only reached the quarterfinals three times. it's not much. it was a long time ago, as well.
are you surprised that he plays at that level? he reached no.28 today. he was no.32 before.
when you stopped with your ankle and all that, was it just a parenthesis, because you seemed to come back with the same level you had before, as fit?
is the best match of your career the one you played against federer here, winning it after saving a match point?
yesterday tomas lost all three breakpoints he faced. today you broke him four times. did you sense he was nervous on his serve, something weak on his serve today?
could you tell us the impact of your coach, jose perlas, because this guy doesn't seem to be really funny. you are a funny guy. how do you mix together?
not really well. so tell me.
what did he bring to your game?
if it's gasquet, the last two times you played him, he kind of destroyed you. it was hard court. what do you see on clay?
do you like the way gasquet plays, his style?
the support from the crowd, is it really a big bonus here?
another couple of hours on court. the kind of test you needed for your ankle? how was it today?
the conversation at the end of the first set, was that a little bit of reassurance you wanted?
other players in your situation after you got the injury, davis cup, would have said, i don't have to come here because i'm not 100%. you came here. is it also that you have been living here a few years, that for you this is like your second home now so you feel that this is important for you and you like the tournament especially?
how difficult mentally is it to forget about the injury when you're playing?
you got the usual time violation warning.
what do you feel?
what do you think about seeing nieminen in the next round? maybe easier than del potro?
every year here in montecarlo you experience new experiences. when you have to play with this ankle now, you focus on that, too. to play three sets instead of two, is almost better or would you prefer 61, 61?
all the time?
you say it's a new experience playing in this kind of situation. do you think it will be beneficial later on in your career knowing you've been through this?
as someone who sat on the player council, therefore involved in rule making, a player 45 down in a tiebreak sits down because of apparently cramps in his thigh.
do you think it's right you should be able to walk off court?
on the face of it, very impressive win today. obviously it tees up a rather interesting match for you tomorrow. what are your impressions?
you did so well, like in indian wells, so close with novak. in miami you also played really well. you're playing right there with the top players. that must give you a lot of confidence, right?
you feel more and more able to be physically matching the top players. what do you think is the key to make the breakthrough in a tournament like this or a grand slam?
you seem to feel good on all surfaces. where do you rank clay?
how long have you spent in stockholm and what have you picked up from the swedes?
i know nadal on clay is sort of a different proposition to anybody on any other surface. do you think the fact that you've experienced playing djokovic and murray just recently gives you a better mindset going into a match like this where you know how you are, how you've reacted to playing the better players?
what do you think you will have to do tomorrow to try to upset nadal?
bnp paribas is a great sponsor for the tournament. people are waiting for you for autographs. you're becoming very popular. how do you deal with the fans?
you should get a sponsor for that.
you couldn't have had a much better start than in the first three or four games. you hardly lost a point.
you always say here is very special for you. what makes it special?
yes. besides just winning.
is it in a way more tiring, the idea that you have always to win when you come to a tournament like this because everyone is expecting you to win all the time on clay, or you don't really care that much?
you talked a little bit the other day about this almost being like starting again again. were you nervous today?
after the french open raising the prize money, do you feel like players are really heard now by organizations? are you satisfied? is there still work to do?
you said at the start of the second set you weren't happy. any reason your level went down?
you've been on the tour for 10 years. 10 years ago it seems there were more clay court players. do you think tennis on clay has changed in 10 years, and what has changed?
what did you think when he knocked over your water bottles today?
you didn't want to go over and knock over his bottles?
you said the other day you felt you did have enough recovery time from indian wells, that you'd be fine here. do you think today is a good example that you were right? your physical condition, you had plenty of time to relax.
it feels good?
pretty happy with that, andy?
did the training you did on clay come into play a lot today?
can you talk about the decision you took to work with mahesh bhupathi? do you like this other side of the game?
yes, the business side of the game. what do you expect?
how many people more or less are taking care of andy murray? apart from lendl, physio, another coach or assist and coach, then you have bhupathi, then you have ugo. do you have any idea how many are involved in your business side?
you also have media pr?
now ugo is working for del potro and you. can there be any sort of problem, you think?
i have no idea. i'm just asking you.
there is an exhibition in south america. they want to see del potro.
next opponent, wawrinka.
was that as comfortable as you felt starting a clay court season? you looked confident all the way through.
novak was saying earlier about the umpires and the need perhaps to warn the players, a discussion before the match, talk them through the time situation, what they're going to do. do you agree with that? seems a lot of people are very confused.
you look much stronger this year. compared from last year, the clay court season last year, starting from the match today, do you feel stronger?
physically, the movement. you just look stronger this year.
do you think there should be a difference in terms of seconds if you play on clay when rallies are longer than somewhere else, grass or so? and, you know, in italy there are certain regions where people are considered tight with money. we always heard a lot of jokes about the scottish. i'd like to know if that reputation is wrong, and what do you think about it?
i'm not asking about you, just the scottish in general.
how did you feel today?
you twice recovered from a break down in each set. what made the difference?
satisfying game for a first game on clay?
what do you need specifically to do to improve your game, your rhythm here? how far would you hope you can go here? can you win here?
you mentioned nadal has a great record here. have you been surprised since his comeback from injuries he's made it to four straight finals? is that surprising or is that what you would expect from him?
when he says that he's still in pain, you think he's probably not?
was the beginning of the third set the turning point of that match?
richard said he was extremely tired at one moment. did you see that?
what happened in the beginning of the match?
can we say you really missed an opportunity today against a good player?
and what about your doubles match?
are you going to play together the grand slams?
was it a late decision for you to come here?
was it a fatigue thing, because you won the first set? he started dropshotting a lot.
you had a massage on the court at one point.
winning on clay must have given you a bit of confidence anyway for not just this tournament but further on.
play madrid?
just a question away from tennis. how shaken were you by the events yesterday in boston?
you have an interesting kind of game. sometimes you don't have too much room for mistakes. houston must have given you a lot of confidence. you have a new coach also, right?
how is it going?
you and querrey are on the top. do you feel pressure representing america? you're the only americans in the draw.
you saw djokovic's injury. surprised he's going to play here?
yes.
john, several athletes have said they're going to do something to help in boston. is that something you've considered, like every ace?
three weeks in a row in montecarlo. how do you feel?
but anyway...
did you like what you make of the court today? tough start maybe, shaky start.
you're mentally very tough.
you are. you had some tough threeset wins. how does it help you in a match like that?
yes.
you played janowicz. how have you seen him?
his game style?
how would you talk about his personality on court? he could be quite fiery.
in that third set, it seems you were changing a little bit the height of the ball. he played very well the second set. did you change your game and use similar aggressiveness as well?
we know you are not trying to find any excuses, but coming back from argentina, you must be exhausted.
this is your first clay court tournament. are you happy with this match?
so you have physical problems and also it's your first clay court match. are there other problems you have?
we're talking about the collateral damages of argentina, of the davis cup. does it apply to you?
what was most difficult on the clay?
how long will it take before your ankle is totally recovered?
is there any risk of getting your ankle worse if you play?
you wanted to be really honest, and you decided that you were not able to play the davis cup tie. so now people are saying it's your fault that the french team lost. what do you think about that?
do you believe you're a target for the press all the time?
what do you expect from this clay court season? you are starting with a high ranking. what are your goals?
among the top 10 players, many of them have been injured, are coming back. does this change the favorites for the french open?
you were very close to losing the first set, then what did you think? what did you do?
this season you were ahead of djokovic in indian wells, then ahead of murray in miami. what did you think after these losses?
do you think it's beginning to get momentum for you because beating a top10 player, having good results so far this season?
you've changed your coaching this season. can you talk about the differences, whether you're trying to do now?
who is the guy in charge for coaching to?
how much clay did you play on when you were a junior?
where was that?
so you feel pretty comfortable?
do you feel it's any easier with the expectations around you right now?
what are the goals for the season? have you set something special?
your tennis style is very similar of federer. what do you think about his game?
the serve...
do you feel any pressure for your fans, many fans and followers across the world? do you feel the pressure from them?
after all those match points you saved, did you think you would be able to come back?
it seemed you produced a lot better tennis than he did and still you lost.
do you believe coming here straight after the davis cup was difficult?
are you tired physically or is it mental?
is it just an impression or you're not very disappointed?
what is your schedule now? you seem to hesitate between two different things.
are you pleased with the recent decision of increasing prize money in the french open?
do you want to continue to manage yourself?
how do you analyze that for your first clay start?
how much did the davis cup impinge on your actual training?
how comfortable are you on clay right now compared to maybe last year, the year before?
you're probably going to have to make a step up when you face jarkko. how do you see that match?
julien said your serve, even on clay, is an unbelievable weapon. are you using it differently regarding the surface?
what are your expectations about the season on clay?
was it difficult to pass from the davis cup, very fast surface, smaller balls, to today's match?
if you're playing doubles with tomic, is it something you want to get into seriously?
do you get frustrated when you cannot make as many aces as you are used to on fast surfaces?
what was the reaction of the canadians when you won the three important matches in davis cup versus italy?
do you think sponsors may have different interest in tennis because of this semifinal?
what would you be happy with finishing here? do you have a goal?
this fight with mika on the court in miami, is it part of your learning process?
about your learning process, you're doing well lately.
but you will never become a robot; you will always talk on the court.
but when you go up to the umpire to talk about a game that took place three games before, isn't that polluting your game?
how do you see a player like nadal who won eight times here?
do you have good memories of the french open?
but you will come to the french open this year with a better stature.
but do you feel people are getting more interested in you and your career?
given your good results lately, do you think you might be called upon to play on the french team for davis cup?
do you believe your fight with mika could be a negative point for you to be a part of the team?
that second serve, 200 kilometers per hour, did it annoy you?
last year we could say you were the victim of bad luck. this year we could say you're the victim of raonic.
did the davis cup have an impact on this particular match? you put more into a davis cup tie than a normal match, and gilles seemed affected, too.
but there's a big difference between you and him: he won the tie.
is anything frustrating you in your game since rotterdam?
you are playing the doubles with zimonjic. how did you get together?
when you entered onto the center court, you did a pilgrimage around the court.
you practiced with djokovic. how is he playing?
was it easier than you were expecting or really today you were playing really well in the altitude of madrid? it's been incredible.
congratulations on your third victory here and for your great career. i think that today you won your 40th tournament on clay. you've got 23rd masters 1000. i wanted to ask you, of all the finals you played and you won them, do you remember this has been the most simple final to beat of all the masters 1000 that you have?
talking about your game, is this the match you are the most satisfied with?
after how well you played on clay this year in montecarlo and south america and madrid, and after what we have seen here in madrid, what djokovic has done, federer, do you see yourself as more of a favorite towards the french open?
this tournament is the number 40 in clay. you're six away from guillermo vilas who one 46 tournaments.
what did you think about being in this moment, and what can you tell us about vilas, being able to reach a player like him next year?
you came back in february, and now you've been in seven finals in seven tournaments. how excited are you now about the prospects of the rest of the year?
in montecarlo you said that you were not playing your best level and you needed to improve some things. do you think that now you are at your best level? and if not, what do you need to improve?
stan has been playing very, very well the last two weeks. you knew that, but you also knew he never won a set against you; didn't today. how did you find him today, and how did you explain that you've never lost a set to him?
congratulations. it felt like a very, very different you today than against benoit paire. you seemed to be much more aggressive going into this match. is it because it's a final and you're just ready to go from the start?
congratulations for your victory. you've already played four matches here in madrid. given the conditions of the court and also with the altitude and the fact that you've been seven months without playing, the feelings are worse or better than you were expecting before coming here?
are you one of those who thinks that the finals are like football, you play them or you win them?
it's possible that tomas berdych is one of the finalists for tomorrow. in 2006 i think there was a problem with him. they were talking about that for a couple of months. i guess that everything is forgotten. i don't know. then another question: the people were talking some months ago that you will never be the same again. what can you say to all of those that are criticizing you so much?
before going back on the circuit in january, mats wilander said that he would be really, really surprised if you would be fighting for the title in roland garros. do you think that analysis was made too early?
you always say that playing at home is important; it's special. i imagine that davis cup you won here was really special. a third title in madrid, where would you rank it? would it be really special?
i wanted to talk about your racquet sponsor. we saw that they took a racquet to the statosphere, the same with felix baumgartner. are you still using that racquet? does it have special powers?
tomorrow you will play your seventh final of the year. looking back three months ago would you have expected that?
i would like to ask you if you could see the match between grigor dimitrov and wawrinka here. also, you beat grigor two weeks ago. i would like to ask you, what do you think dimitrov can improve to approach the top 10 or top 15 or whatever, and if you are friends outside of the matches?
you were four games to two in the third set; what happened?
last year you got to the final against roger. you are losing some points, but this year the courts are better, or what is your opinion of this year's courts?
the success in davis cup for the czech republic has been a great thing for the country. apart from that, you now you are in the lead with stepanek or there are some more players? how do you see the future of czech tennis?
can you make a general opinion of the match?
hello, pablo. how are you? congratulations for the tournament. i wanted to ask you, you made it for the first time to a semifinal of a masters 1000. do you think this is the top that you can reach, or do you think that one day you can make it to the final and win a masters 1000?
what difference do you think there was, talking about your game and rafa's game, comparing this game to the one you played two years ago in paris?
i wanted to ask you about that ball when you were 32. the second serve you threw the ball out of the court. are you going to remember a long time that ball?
how was the mindset after that 60? after that i'm sure you wanted to leave the court. when did you change your mindset?
what do you take from this masters 1000? what would you take and not repeat in order to learn a lesson?
right now your parents have been in the studio. apart from many other things they have told us  and i will tell new the private because there are some secrets  your mother told us that she had a little bit worse time in other matches because she even was nervous when she saw you winning the quarterfinals. today she was more relaxed and she saw you were really nervous with. at 60, did you think that a dream of playing a masters 1000 was going to turn into a nightmare and you could hate the match rather than enjoy it?
nadal has been seven months without playing; you played with him before and you have played with him after those situations. do you think there is any difference in the way he plays?
how was your mindset towards this tournament and how is it right now towards the future?
in the ranking you were 113, and in a week, thanks to a wildcard, you will be 50 something. how do you assess that change? and also sportly talking, maybe you can try to reach the top 30. what do you think?
do you remember roland garros 2011? today was not the same, but over there you were playing at a really high level. even the audience from france was supporting you. is it going to be like a catapult for you? will this push you?
as well as you played tonight, i'm sure you'll be kicking yourself a little bit because you had the 43 lead in the first and lead in the second as well.
hard to know with just a handful of matches, but where do you see your form on clay this year compared to previous years?
you seem to be holding your left hip at the start of the matches the last two nights. anything to worry about there?
you've always talked about clay as kind of being a work in progress for you. where would you say that progress is at the moment going into rome first and then obviously the french after that?
i presume it's never easy to finish a match at 1:00 and go to bed 4:00 in the morning and come back and play another match against a very good player. i know you wouldn't make an excuse, but give us a sense of how tough that is to recover and play the next night?
good afternoon, david. i just wanted to know if you had in your mind when you were at 1530, you had a quite easy bail to make it 1540. then you see that rafa does a really good loop. it went over you. after that did it go through your mind that the match was going?
david, what is tougher: to lose like today or like in the final at acapulco?
after that point you got lost. in the third set you weren't competitive. you weren't competitive with the same level as the other sets.
what do you think are the aspects that you can look back to to be better? what can you try to develop and get better for the next matches?
do you think that nadal right now is the favorite? there has been so many surprises in this tournament. how did you see it?
in the first set you had a break; in the second another one. then you had the chance to fly. do you think the key was there, especially in the second set? do you think the key of the match was there?
in respect to the match against haas, in which you were much more offensive with the backhand, do you think that the victory, to have a victory today you needed to play more aggressively?
you've said happened nadal is really good right now. nadal too after the match said you did a really good match. he said today probably the one who played the best hasn't won. do you think there is not also a physical part of this match but maybe a little bit of mental disconnect in the third set perhaps on your side?
rafa said that you deserved to be in the semis. do you think that is a smaller gap with the top 4, or do you think they're too good and when you reach the moment of truth they have got a little extra?
talking about the technical stuff, i've seen you doing a much better volley. you were lucky in the match. do you think the altitude here in madrid makes you volley more or makes you go up to the net more?
congratulations on the win. third time in a row you've beaten andy on a clay court. is there something about the surface and the matchup that favors you on clay?
he seemed to play pretty well. his dropshot was good today. that speaks highly your level tonight. you must be really satisfied.
how important were the serves, especially on the break points in that first set? you came up with a couple of really big serves at crucial moments today.
as you said before, your level doesn't seem to change depending on the surface. you're one of the few players. even the big four have their favorite surfaces. what is your favorite surface?
what is your favorite surface?
is that a new confidence we're seeing from you, tomas, when you win your first slam?
you will play against wawrinka or tsonga tomorrow. can you tell a few words about both players, especially about tsonga since every match you have against him was very tough, very close?
congratulations for the match. you made it to the semifinals. how do you feel right now?
pablo, did you feel pressure when you were trying to close the first set and then the match, because the points were quite long?
i wanted to ask you something: in roland garros you took him to the limit in the first set, i think it was?
in a closer match do you feel you have more options? in a tournament like madrid where the ball flies faster, do you think you have more options in tomorrow's match?
sorry i was late. i don't know if they asked you before. could you tell us what happened to you to drop down in the ranking? also, everything here is work for you. what has happened?
how will you face this night? i guess with a lot of nerves? what are you going to do to distract yourself?
nishikori said that he thinks that you played really well and that he committed a lot of errors, many more than he thought he would commit. there were a lot of expectations about him because he had beaten federer. well, everyone was talking about him. how did you face the match and how did you feel that the match went? were you surprised?
you're winning a lot of different games, games on deuce and ones that you attack with your serve. normally you've had some problems in your serve. how does it feel right now?
congratulations. great victory?
how are you feeling at the moment?
did you feel pressure in the second set with a little bit of unforced errors?
congratulations. in the third set you got the break. how important was it for you to get that break at that point in the match? did it relax you a little bit more?
what do you think about your next opponent, andujar?
the courts are different this year; last year it did favor roger's game. how do you think you were able to be aggressive and keep putting pressure on him? he was always on the defensive. how did you do that?
i know you've had some very good wins in your career, but a first win over roger federer is always extremely special. talk about that in your career, to beat a player of his quality.
you don't have two days. you play tomorrow.
what is the most difficult for you on clay? we all know how good you are on hard courts.
seemed at the outset today you were just a little off with your shots. is that a fair reflection? just missing a little bit today?
i presume some people will make more of the fact now that you had an extended break. perhaps if you had played more you might not have played like that. what would you make of that argument?
roger, he said that in the second set he got a little bit worried because he thought you played more aggressively. then in the beginning of the third set he thought you were very aggressive also. but then as the match went on you seemed a little bit more defensive. do you think it was because of his game or yours?
how about the debate about madrid and its place in the calendar at this stage. obviously it's nothing like playing in paris. if you're going to prepare well for paris, is this one of those tournaments you think maybe i should or shouldn't? because the conditions are so different from rome or paris that you would consider whether it's actually worth playing here?
in terms of clay court preparation for the slam.
would you like to have another rest or better to get on to the next tournament?
in past tournaments you feel a little bit of pain in your back. it all right, the pain in your back?
and during this week?
so you're painfree?
here in madrid, you have titles in hard court and now in clay. you have three titles. it was enough or a concession to rafa, or nishikori is really an upcoming player?
that if you needed a little rest or it's nishikori.
yes. i tried to yes. you lost today, so then your perspective is that nishikori played great or it's good to have a little rest or you have many titles in madrid?
madrid is gonna miss you.
we are going to miss you here.
do you have the impressions that the young generations are pushing harder this year than they used to do, like dimitrov and now nishikori?
roger, congratulations for your career. after that, maybe is your last madrid and your last year playing tennis?
congratulations for your victory, first of all. how did you feel? how are the feelings here? how are you recovering yourself?
rafa, now you are talking about two points, a miracle, one in each set. maybe that was the key of the match. the match was an hour and a quarter. did you hope you would play longer given the opponent?
in montecarlo you were saying that sometimes you have the feeling that to win is a tie, because in this year you have to defend your titles. coming to this tournament where you can win some points, do you play with a different mentality here?
you always go match after match. do you think three of the possible winners of the tournament, like nico almagro and ferrer and federer are possible rivals in order to make it to the final? do you think about that?
you've talked already twice about the altitude and the serves. in a tournament like this, do you work more on your serve or on your return? are you happy today with your serve?
you said that you play with less anxiety after the injury. do you feel more pressure when you play tournaments like this one in madrid?
i wanted to ask you about the defeat of djokovic yesterday. were you surprised about it? what did you think about the attitude of the crowd with him? what did you think about dimitrov?
rafa, in the first press conference that you gave here in the tournament you didn't expect a lot of differences between your game in respect to the games in montecarlo and barcelona. after that match do you still have that feeling?
just an assessment of your performance today, please.
we had a piece of football news in england today from manchester. what's you're view on that?
what are your thoughts on the crowd today? when paire was hitting winners they started booing him. yesterday was the same with djokovic.
the crowd, when paire was hitting dropshots, when he was attacking and trying to beat you...
paire today, against paire today.
how did you feel?
your next opponent is tommy haas i think. what do you expect from that match? then, i think that the courts this year are much better, not only in respect to last year, but in respect to other years.
what are your expectations of the tournament?
with djokovic out of the tournament, do you think you've got options to win the tournament?
i wanted to ask you the way the court is. does it feel very different compared to last year?
why does it take you so much effort to win youzhny?
did you have any problem in your hip?
do you think that youzhny brining in his physio affected you? do you think it stopped your rhythm?
there was a moment in the third set where there was something from the crowd that you didn't like. were they supporting youzhny?
apart from the fact that youzhny's physiotherapist came in, in the first set you had a moment where you were comfortable on the court. suddenly youzhny started dominating. what happened over there? i thought you were pretty comfortable at first.
it was tough match, especially in the first set. did you expect it as it was?
i wanted to ask you physically you are okay? because end of the first set and beginning of the second set it was like you were struggling breathing.
explain the challenges that you have to face on clay.
many people, observers, have said that 26 and 27 are the best ages to reach your peak as a male player, professional tennis player. what would you give to celebrate your 26th with a victory here?
in the next round your opponent will be gilles simon. i think you know each other well. do you expect a tough game against him?
you look really tired over the match. it has nothing to do with the surface?
speaking about the altitude, obviously it's completely different conditions to the french open. do you think in a way it's quite pointless in a warmup tournament that it's so different to what you're warming up for?
congratulations on your victory.
you need one more title to equal john mcenroe's 77 for the career.
equalling mcenroe, what would that mean to you in in the context of your career, and do you think you could even catch up with lendl and possibly connors?
two months outside of the courts, how have you been?
you held for 42, and then you both went and exchanged racquets. he was about to serve and you were about to receive. that's the difference? why would you do it at that point? i know it's fresh, the strings, but can you tell us about that a little bit?
what do you think about the spectators, the fans in spain? they applaud you ever place. don't matter what you do.
don't matter if you get wrong or...
(question off microphone.)
with the slower start of the season in comparison with other years, which do you think are your chances to regain the no.1? is it a goal for you this season in the rankings?
congratulations, roger. it was a great pleasure to see win again.
last year there was some controversy over the surface, and you, regardless of that, just swept through to victory. i've heard very positive things about the surface this year. i was wondering, i know you may have spoken about this in the past, but how do you find the surface this year?
you've been on the tour for a while now. since ten, twenty years, seems there has been less and less clay court players. do you have this impression? do you think that now maybe players play the same tennis on hard court and on clay court?
radek and you both are over 30. last week tommy haas won a title. do you think you can play five or four more years?
what you can say about the match? did you expect this, what happened? was dimitrov better in this match?
how are you physically, and what do you make about the crowd and the way they reacted?
there seemed to be a point at 45 in the first set where you thought you had won the first set and dimitrov played a ball long. it was overturned. what happened in that moment?
will you go back to madrid next year after the boos of the spectators?
novak, it seemed as though the crowd, i mean, there were a lot young kids calling your name out early on and cheering you on. seemed to be a moment where you seemed to twist your ankle and you were in apparent pain and the crowd suddenly turned against you. did you feel it that way?
i want to ask you about dimitrov.
why do you think this situation was with the crowd? why?
no?
i don't know. do you think...
no, but this is topic, sometimes people think that the audience in madrid doesn't know much about tennis. what do you think about that?
you said for this tournament that you didn't prepare yourself so good. can you elaborate? after montecarlo, what happened between there and now?
hi, nico. good afternoon. you've just went in and out. what you've got now, it's a pretty difficult draw. can you analyze it?
hi, nico. i would like to know how you feel the ball here in madrid? how did you find yourself playing in this court?
after the final of godo, how do you face this tournament?
hi, nico. i wanted to ask if you feel the difference between the speed of the ball here from that in godo. is there a lot of difference?
congratulations for the victory. in madrid you always achieve good results. last year you made it to quarterfinals against rafa. what does madrid give you? what does the audience give you? you always manage an optimal level here in madrid.
i don't know if you have changed racquets. is that true? if you have, how have you adapted to it? has that been difficult? also, what is the ribbon?
this week you have a new racquet or three years with the same racquet?
i would like to know, in a complicated moment, the career of athlete, maybe not in your best moment, where did you find the motivation to keep looking forward?
i would like to ask you, have you felt comfortable, and do you think the change of surface benefits the players? and on the other side, even though you're not 100%, do you want to take this tournament home? are you happy about it?
i would like to ask you about the first set and the second one. they were very different. what are your feelings?
physically how do you feel? also talking about the knees.
an optimistic detail: with all the class that you have, you've done already two doubles with feliciano. but with david marrero, as he is canarian, is that going to bring you good luck? you could go to the london masters.
congratulations. how do you feel now?
how do you see yourself for the australian open?
did you feel that physically you had more than he did throughout the whole time?
do you think the turning point of the match was in the second set when you were down a break point and you could have gone down...
what were your thoughts when he went off with the injury? i mean, you didn't seem too happy that he was taking so much time, but at the same time did you think that maybe when he came back that you had a clear advantage?
davydenko said you beat him physically. do you think it was actually physically or it was your technique, also?
i read that you pulled out of sydney. is that true?
but you are feeling fine? it's just precautionary?
these two break points at 42 in the second, is it the biggest moment of the match?
i'm sure you don't want to take any credit away from him, but were you also affected by an injury? was it a hip flexor?
you did pretty well throughout the week. what are your feelings? are you proud of your performance throughout this week?
do you have any feeling of how capable you may be to recover more physical strength in the coming weeks?
can you talk to us about the match and how it went for you?
you saved all the break points that you faced. was this very important for you to get through this match without getting broke?
you seem right now to be in a high point in your career. you have had some ups and downs and everything. what do you think is going right right now?
you seem pretty confident. are you hoping to make a push for the top 5 this season?
you seem to improved mentally as the match went on. you got better and better. do you know how or why that happens, or is it something which is hard to explain?
that insideout forehand that he has and the way he comes to the net and his serve, does that make him one of the more awkward opponents you have faced?
did you seek to deny him angles with that forehand by perhaps playing a little further forward?
just look a little bit of the possibilities of tomorrow, either nikolay or david?
they both make their opponents run a lot. are you happy that you played earlier so you get just a few extra hours of rest?
could you have done anything different against an opponent playing as well as that?
what's the way to deal with somebody who takes risks like that, hitting the ball flat and attacking all the time? what's the best way to try and stop that?
do you think that's partly because it's the first tournament of the year?
have you nevertheless achieved one of your main aims this week, which is to get good practice and good preparation?
in that first set, was it his play or you had like 15 unforced errors. what was happening in that first set? was it him playing so well or were you struggling with your own game?
you talked a little bit last time, you have seen him play this week, but is this a different davydenko than we have seen in a few years? what do you expect from him now?
how can you summarize the week you spent here, the games you played? your physical condition? are you ready to go to the australian open?
what were like the difficulties that you faced in this game today, the major difficulties?
are you relieved that it was much easier than yesterday?
did you also concentrate much more on the strengths that you know that you have today?
and the backhand was flowing today.
obviously lacko had his ankle problems. was that something you were thinking about as the match went along, and were you trying to keep him moving to kind of take advantage of that at all?
are you surprised that you're not playing gal monfils next?
because of the way brands plays coming in, he will give you a target to aim at. will that suit you?
you know, this new rule, 25second rule, it seemed to really bother monfils yesterday, but is that something at least this week that you've thought about? how do you feel about...
it seemed like your best match of the tournament. you got off to a much quicker start than you had earlier in the week. maybe just talk us through the match a little bit.
it was 62 minutes. i think it was the shortest game of the week, so do you see yourself winning final?
it's the first week of the season, but obviously the australian open is starting to come up close, 10 days away. a match like this, does that help push your confidence, looking ahead?
you were winning points in quite a lot of different ways, as well, weren't you? was that particularly pleasing for you, sometimes with your forehand, sometimes playing a drop?
then at the end of the match you got completely on top. you won a very long string of points together. did you get in the zone, or did you feel that everything was coming together?
you could play nikolay davydenko or simone bolelli. could you talk about one or either of them and what it's like to play them?
what would it take for you to go up another level, move up into the top four? what would you do in your game?
i think many people are surprised not only by your results but by the way you play. for all who have not seen you before, do you play this way on all surfaces?
it must be tough to play in this very aggressive style on courts which are not always so fast. do you find it harder to do so in these conditions or not?
two connected questions, if i may. did you think the second set had gone when you were 52 and 30love down? and how is it that you win your points in such very fast streaks?
it's the first tournament of the year. you came as a qualifier. now you're in the semifinals. just tell me, would you have wished for any better at the beginning?
yesterday you played against an egyptian player ranked outside the top 400. i just wanted you to comment on his game and whether you think he has potential.
what do you think your potential is?
you fought very hard for a very long time to win that match, didn't you?
did those set points get away from you in the first set because it's early in the season and the first tournament?
you looked as though you were mentally stronger than him at the end.
can you just talk about your next match? i think you play lukas?
does it help that you went through a tough match today that you can go tomorrow more confident, or you prefer to finish...
tonight you write two chinese characters instead of one: love and smile. for the past two weeks in china, what is the thing you love the most and what gave you the best reason to smile?
you tried really hard tonight. it looks like you really wanted this one. your opponent was a very decent opponent. it's possible you can gain back your no.1 ranking. does that give you the extra motivation to put a lot into this match?
could you talk about the first service game in the second set. bit of an odd one.
yours.
were you struggling with your balance in that game, footing?
do you think del potro has a real chance of challenging right at the top of the game, the world no.1 ranking, also to win slams, if he can keep this up?
which is more important to you next year, getting no.1 or winning the roland garros title?
yes.
how will you prepare for your wedding?
maybe you can buy some souvenirs here.
you got really good fan support tonight. talk about what part that played in your winning the match.
you talk about that support, but there were times in the second and third sets when you seemed to be getting pretty frustrated. were you getting a little annoyed that the crowd were getting behind juan martin?
the two characters you wrote on the camera, when you put it together, there's a meaning there. it means love smiling. we know you're the kind of a guy that loves to put a smile on people's face. when your opponent del potro hit the big forehand during the match even. is that an attitude to relax yourself in the match?
you talked a few times about how fantastic the fans here are. can you tell us what gift that surprised you and impressed you most this time?
have you ever faced such a brutal, consistent display of tennis as you faced tonight? del potro was on fire.
since juan martin won the us open in 2009, only four players have won grand slam titles since then. do you think he is the player most likely to break back into that top group of players?
you've been saying all week that the court surface here is faster than beijing. is that almost perfect conditions for juan martin, the way he hits the ball hard and low?
we all know the last time del potro beat you was 2009 us open semifinal. how different has he become as a player since then, in your opinion?
two weeks ago you came to china with the no.2 ranking and the perfect record on hard courts. now you go back to europe with no.1 ranking and two defeats on hard court. can you sum up your experience in asia for the two weeks.
you still have an opportunity to win six masters this year with paris coming up. we know that tournament is always a difficult one because of where it sits in the calendar. is the idea of getting that sixth masters of the year going to play into your decision to play that one?
it seemed like you won pretty comfortably in the end without playing your best tennis. are you confident you can raise your game tomorrow against rafa or del potro?
the success you've had in china this year, last year, beijing, winning four times, what is it about these tournaments here? is it the time of year you like playing? is it the courts? a combination of things?
i know your training partner of this week is a chinese player.
talk about him, technique, potential.
do you have any advice for him?
when players are coming up the ladder, when you first show up, we size everyone up and say, that's a potential grand slam champion. we had you on that list, rafa. we had jo on that list, richard gasquet, even gal monfils. any thoughts why you and rafa made it, and those guys haven't quite realized the potential we kind of envisioned?
does it surprise you at all those three, all frenchmen, haven't done it?
speaking of the mental game, much is made of being the hunter or the hunted. for so long you were the hunted. this is the first week in a long time being the hunter. is there a change at all in you?
back to the first time you came to shanghai, what kind of image of the tennis market did you have? did you expect one day you'd have a huge tennis market here with fans?
the second set, seventh game, two points drew a bit of a reaction from you. how important was it to keep your cool after that and close out the match?
talk a little bit about the match and then also following the match from yesterday and coming out again.
you were injured relatively early in the season. it's been a struggle since then. looking back on the season, how many tournaments have you been able to play injuryfree?
the second set, you got a little upset with the umpire. talk about what happened there and if this was a distraction.
did it distract you for the rest of that set?
you played so well in this tournament. are you sad at all the season is ending?
i talked to jo about this before. we tend to think of the top nation in the top of the rankings as the spanish, yet both you and spain have the same seven players in the top 50. they have 14 in the top 100. you have 13 in the top 100. why do you think we don't think of the french quite at that level with the spanish?
jo thought that maybe because you guys are not quite as tight friends as the spanish, that you're not driving each other. any truth to that?
were you feeling initially comfortable at the start? the first two service games you dropped.
a lot of players have said the place where they feel the most culture shock is in asia. you seem to feel quite comfortable here. talk about your relationship with asia. has it taken time or was it straight off?
each time when he was arguing with the umpire, tied up his shoestrings, how could you concentrate on the game? do you think it's all about mental in the game?
there's been a lot of talk about the development of tennis in china. one of the aspects of that is the challenger circuit within china. can you talk about your experience on the challenger circuit in europe and your thoughts on what needs to happen in china to help build the game here.
i noticed that you are very good at managing your mental conditions when the situation was not in your favor. sometimes you yelled at yourself. could you tell us how did you adjust your mentality during the match and then win the match.
looking ahead to the semifinal against jowilfried tsonga. your thoughts on the match.
a very entertaining match, particularly the second set. when those sorts of points are going on, are you aware and can you enjoy those sorts of matches or do you not realize it until afterwards?
you were mentioning the humidity. how many shirts do you walk on court with?
andy just announced he will pull out of the world tour finals. are you expecting him to come back strong next year?
after seeing the tiebreak go federer's way, you regrouped and stayed strong in the third set. talk us through how that went for you mentally.
given roger's notsogreat year compared to his previous years, do players now go into matches with him with a different mindset? did you go into today's match more confident knowing the struggles he's had this year?
it seems like the home court of federer. each time they cheer for federer. what did you think of that?
what surprised you today from roger's side?
considering there are four places left for london, and roger is one of those trying to qualify, how big a win do you think this one is for you?
you have the possibility of meeting djokovic. how much of a boost does this win prepare you for that match?
during the match with monfils, when he attacked your backhand, you used the slice. do you have the confidence with your backhand to use it as a weapon?
after the second set, a great comeback to steal that set, then a little bit of a dip in the beginning of the third. what was the difference today, in your opinion?
roger, it's fair to say that you're the icon of this tournament. you helped substantially to build up the fan base, the tennis market. there's going to be one day you will not be competing any more in the shanghai masters. but the tournament still is going somewhere. what would you expect this tournament to be like when you're not playing anymore here?
no. in the future, let's say in 10 years.
most players play one tournament between the us open and here. you didn't. i wonder if you feel that you paid the price for that in any way? and also do you feel you got your schedule right bearing in mind you took the long break in the spring before you played in madrid?
you've remained defiant after previous losses in what's for you been a relatively poor year. the fact remains you are losing to players who you never used to lose to before. what can you do to recover the spark for next season?
you said earlier in the week you don't have a lot of points to defend next year, but you'd like to have a strong finish to this season. how does this loss today factor into that strong end of the season, if at all?
you are the first to arrive in shanghai of the top 10 players. does it distract you from the game or make you a little bit fatigued?
you took part in this event, many activities.
you were the first player to arrive in shanghai. does it distract you from the game and make you a little bit fatigued?
now that andy murray is not going to be in london, does it open a small door for you? do you think about it that way?
just talk a little bit about your match today, how well you played.
beijing and here you've been serving really well, holding most of your serves fairly easily. how did you step up the serve in the last part of the season?
any thoughts on your next match? sadly for the audience they can't see a match between you and roger.
roger talked a little bit about how earlier this season he was troubled after indian wells with the back. he's had a muchreduced schedule. after the olympics last year, felt it was almost kind of an inbetween year and feels he'll come back stronger in 2014. from what you've seen of him, do you think he is going to be back to challenging yourself and andy and rafa next year?
we saw the character you drew on the camera. are you sure that's the character of love?
are you sure that's the character of love?
it's a little bit difficult for me to recognize that character.
i think a fan told you how to draw that.
how did you feel out there tonight? you've had problems in earlyround matches here in the past. is it just a matter of getting back into match shape after being off for a bit?
your thoughts on carlos berlocq, just beating john isner.
you went to watch roger's game before your game. it seems like it is not common. for what purpose did you go to watch the game?
a lot of players have started to use twitter and facebook as a way to engage their fans. you do it in english and spanish. is that a way for you to get closer to your fans?
viktor troicki's case is up for appeal today. what is your opinion as to whether or not of the 18month suspension was too harsh.
talk about the surface. you said the surface is faster than the other years. considering the recent changes to your game, playing more aggressive, less spin, is this a time where you feel more comfortable on faster surfaces like this?
tough early in the match for you. but you quickly recovered and broke straight back. you seemed to discover your mojo. talk us how the match went.
can you talk a little bit about your next match with gal. pretty entertaining one.
you've been active on twitter since you got here to shanghai. yesterday was quite funny. talk about using social media platforms to engage your fans. how do you feel about it now that you are using it?
seems like you are the most popular one here. everybody came to watch your practice this afternoon. the first time you came here, do you still remember the fans were the same, crazy about you? do you realize that in your game? even nadal came to watch your game.
you had a few more errors out there tonight than i'm sure you wanted. were you feeling match rustiness after the long break? what do you have to do to get through that? does it come after a few matches?
you spoke a little bit about expecting a bit of a lag this year on the back of the olympics. do you still feel like your best years are ahead of you?
last week novak was talking about wanting to see some changes within doping control, related to the troicki case, that there needs to be some sort of check that allows players to skip a test. what are your thoughts on the current protocols in terms of how tests are issued and whether or not there needs to be any changes in the system?
how did you come out to with the name for your doubles team?
yes, your doubles team.
can you talk about what happened in the first game of the second set with your right foot or right heel. how bad was the scare, if you can call it that?
could you tell us something about your next match, fognini. did you see the match against nadal last week?
going back to the foot. was it on the bone or was it muscular, tendon?
just thinking back a couple of years. last time you were getting ready for a davis cup final for serbia, you said that was your primary focus. now you've won the davis cup. is it your primary focus for the rest of the season? you have the atp world tour finals.
a lot of tennis players, including yourself, have jumped onto this social media thing. can you talk about what it's like using twitter, facebook, to engage your fans.
a little bit about the mindset of somebody who is one of the best in their time period. obviously everyone realistically knows at some point in time you aren't going to be able to perform at that level day in, day out down the line. do you actually ever think of that? it's totally out of your mind? how do you deal with that inevitability or don't you?
you tweeted a picture of the doorway of the lockers, but you never showed the picture inside. can you tell us like how it is inside?
maybe you can talk about the first set. you actually had advantages. what happened?
today you are faced against a very good player with a good backhand.
what about zhang ze playing with roger federer?
what do you think of this match?
zhang ze said in the next two years his objective is to make sure his ranking can be in the top 100. what are your plans for the next two years?
in the beginning of the year wu di at the australian open was the first to be a qualified player. i wonder whether you have had any communication with him, whether you admired him having that opportunity?
do you have a fixed partner for doubles to make sure your ranking can be in the top 100?
zhang ze and you are from the same jiang su team. has zhang ze told you any funny stories of playing with roger?
this season is approaching the end. what is your plan for the australian open wild card matches? also for next year, what type of matches do you want to play? what is your plan for a higher ranking?
in the past two years if you look at the chinese men's team, they have a lot of people's attention. investment is also bigger. any feelings on your part?
after the national games in china, the jiang su team sent a letter to the provincial government to try to increase investment in tennis. also the letter mentioned inviting coaches for you and zhang ze. what is the plan? will there be any plan to give you a personal trainer?
a tricky one to start. talk about the match a little bit, specifically the second set with all the set points.
is the court any different from past years?
are you aware at all of what you have to do to qualify for the yearend world tour finals? is that on your mind at all?
you're a guy who quite often tends to go the distance in matches. have you ever been able to analyze why your game tends to go that way?
is that the area of the game you'll work on the most, your returning game?
last year when we were here, there was a lot of chatter about rafa, when he's going to come back, what's wrong with his knees. this year andy murray isn't here. there doesn't seem to be that chatter. do you think it's because he explained the situation or does two slams not get you quite to that status where everybody is wondering where you are?
andy murray doesn't seem to have that level of conversation going on like rafa did last year.
can you talk about today's match.
what is the area that you think he gave you the most pressure? i also want to know whether you were tired in the second part of the match?
five days ago in beijing, the china open, you played a match with isner. you said that demonstrated the real skills of the two players. what about today?
over the past few years you participated in the atp shanghai rolex masters with a wild card. i think you have changed a lot. this is the first time you played in the center court. any different feelings?
djokovic said it's going to be five years until asia can produce a topranked player. do you agree with that?
if you are a player with a bigger serve, you may have advantages. what do you think of that?
such a hardearned win. does it feel more special because of that?
i believe you're a big boxing fan. it seemed like a heavyweight fight out there, the ways you were staggering and hurting and exhausted. you carried on. can you talk about your boxing training? does it help you in situations like this?
at the awards you began your speech by you said some really nice things about david. do you just have a little bit of guilt for having pulled off the win?
down a match point, can you take us through that point that maybe was the boost when that shot was upheld?
i'm thinking about the training you did between the australian and this one. would you ascribe some of the fact you came through this one to the work you did then?
you said you didn't know what would happen in the fourth and fifth set. what made this as tough if not tougher than the five sets you played against djokovic in the us open?
it looked like you tweaked your ankle late in the third set.
did it slow you down?
were you aware that cbs left the match going into the tiebreaker to switch to the basketball tournament?
what's your reaction to that? i know you're a basketball fan, but is it a bit of a commentary on the state of tennis in the sports land here or perceived state of tennis that they wouldn't show the tiebreak?
can you comment on being back up to no.2 in the rankings? how important is it this time around compared to the previous time you got to no.2?
in the couple seconds you had before finding out whether your ball was good or not, did you have time to even think about it, get worried, anything?
also, i believe this is the first time someone has saved match point in the decisive set, in a tiebreaker [sic]?
a lot of players are struggling with the 25second rule. do you think the clock on court will help?
you had so many chances in the first set, and it seems like a lot of break points, making errors after errors, which was very frustrating for you. was it the conditions that were bothering you initially, or what was the reason why...
just wondered when you spoke to the supervisor in the final set, was that about the injury...
when you train with david, is that here?
did you know him when you trained in barcelona as a teenager?
medical attention? did you need medical help after this match, intravenous fluids, anything like that?
after you won, was it more a feeling of pure exhaustion or jubilation, or are you too tired to realize?
first of all, great match, great fight. can you tell us what the condition was like when you didn't get the match point, when you challenged it, you might have won it? and then heading into the tiebreak, seemed to me you might have been just gassed, out of gas. can you talk about you physically at the end there?
do you think you should have hit that ball, now looking back?
you're typically known for your fitness. you have had a couple of long matches lately. how did you feel when you got up this morning? did you feel like...
what was it like playing the match?
do you know that you have a lot of sympathy from crowds and fans?
when did you start getting cramps?
so it affected you in the tiebreaker? did it affect you?
do you feel like you're finally getting like worldwide respect? i know you haven't beaten the big guys in the big finals, but you're getting so close, australian semis and here. do you feel like you're getting that worldwide respect, especially in your country? because you have to deal with the rafa nadal love affair.
did you need intravenous fluids?
do you feel like after you broke in the second set, andy went 44, you were broken again. do you feel like maybe if you had held that game that the outcome might have been even different?
do you think andy was in worse condition than you? he seemed to be very like staggering and...
did it turn at the beginning of the second? once you got that lead, were you feel more confident?
how would you rate your overall performance tonight?
the 30somethings are having quite a tournament here. you face another one on sunday. do we have a trend on our hands? is there something going on that's made the game more inviting for guys in their 30s, able to hang around longer?
you see a guy like haas, 34, can you envision yourself hanging around that long?
do you feel an expectation to win now that you're the last remaining member of the big 4 in the tournament?
you said before when you played novak you prepare for a physical war. it's a bit like that with ferrer, as well, isn't it?
your olympics doubles partner is in the final here. did you follow her match today?
what was in your mind after watching haas playing in the first game?
yes.
what was in your mind after watching haas play in the first...
what did you do to turn the match around? third set was service, break, service, break, service, break. what allowed you to turn it around and win?
having won your first masters in paris, how hungry does that make you to get another one?
if it is andy, what kind of match do you have to play against him?
and if it is gasquet that you have to play?
the last win in paris, it took you your whole career to get that win. are you surprised you're here again another one so soon?
it doesn't matter if you win or lose in the final, you're still going to go back to no.4.
does that mean anything for you, or...
you have been playing well all year. was this one of the best?
the only other frenchman who has done well here is your coach. is he telling you good things?
there were some reports that you were having some ankle problems in indian wells. is that feeling better?
what sort of challenge does andy murray give you as an opponent?
with your results here, you're going to move to no. 9 in the rankings, and you could go as high as no.8 in the tournament. have you set any specific ranking goals for yourself this year?
you have two coaches, right?
what is it that one offers over the other?
any tactical difference between the two?
i wanted to pick up on what you said on one of your previous answers. you said you have nothing to lose. in some of the matches you have played against andy, you have been in big situations leading at wimbledon and he came back to win. how much different do you feel on a court when you don't have much to lose?
you played him at indian wells just a couple of weeks ago. what was the difference today?
do you think it could be a problem for the davis cup coming next week for you?
no, but because you mentioned that your tank was empty, so...
have you set any specific ranking goals for yourself for this year, making the top 5, or do you tend to just go match by match?
do you think richard played much better than in indian wells?
is there a chance you may withdraw from some tournaments over the next month to refuel?
how did you turn it around? what was the story in the first set?
what's it like here now? obviously roger didn't enter, rafa didn't enter, and now novak is out.
you have done well here before. you have been in the semifinals here twice before?
is there something about this tournament you like?
is this like a good city for you because it's got a very spanish...
anything in particular you like to do in miami?
did you find the conditions hard to deal with, or do you like playing when it's a little bit cooler outside?
you're the kind of a top player that doesn't get that much attention or press or anything. are you happy just to go about your little life and not be the focus?
obviously a tough day at the office. what didn't happen out there for you?
these are the top 10 players you're playing. you can't do that against them, right, sam?
seemed like you started off well but then your serve let you down.
second set you were there, though. it was 12, and i think you had game point and a backhand volley got away from you.
any disappointment? obviously you're the last american male.
is that a way to make the american players feel good about themselves, at davis cup right at this point, sam?
you had a day off yesterday because of the walkover. did that interrupt your momentum?
for there to be no americans in the quarters, that's big news, especially at this tournament. is this the new norm? because there are just so many players from so many places. should americans just get used to it? do you think the tide is beginning to turn at the junior level? what are your thoughts longterm about it?
there are two players now from the atp in the quarterfinals against melzer and ferrer who are over 30 years old. i know ten years ago, more than that, that definitely wasn't the norm. there were very few players in the top 100; now there are a lot. can you talk about that perception? what do you think about these guys winning, and how do you think about them?
when you play against a ferrer or melzer, do you think in your head  are you thinking at all about their age?
do you think that berdych was playing exceptionally well today? was he playing better than you had experienced him?
you mentioned john's little rough patch. how do you find the momentum to turn it on a dime and do what you guys did recently and do what you do in davis cup?
talking about davis cup, john mentioned the same thing the other day. you guys talked amongst each other about the importance of maybe finding that rhythm again and taking on a long streak there at davis cup.
it's pretty cool to be the best player in your country right now, really, but do you consider that a badge of honor at this point, or do you feel like you need to do better in the masters and the slams to really earn that ranking?
how are you feeling? because you looked like you did have a leg issue at one point.
would that be anything you need to look at tomorrow on the day off?
can you tell us about the playing conditions? because it was quite different from a couple of days ago. was it a lot tougher today to end the points?
are you happy about the performance with your serve? apart from the last game when you saved the break point, you basically haven't given him any chance.
you were saying to me the other night that you have to be a bit careful in training as you get older not to pick up niggles. the kind of twinges you had today, do they happen more for you now than they used to?
does it make a difference now that you have that break? is it an advantage?
because you're living in the area, do you consider these like home courts, or would you say queen's would be more home courts or the all england? and when you do come here and play in the offseason, do you go to the center court specifically or whatever is available?
this is your third straight quarterfinal, fifth year.
why do you play so well here?
on court you said you played pretty much your best level of play today. what would you say you need to improve for your next round?
were the conditions a lot better today? it's cooler out.
you're going to be 31 soon. next week?
that's my husband's birthday.
good day. and i know melzer is 31. you look very young; you play very young. do you feel like you're getting do you feel a difference now from when you play the young kids?
in the match against nishikori, how did you think of his performance today? he said he wasn't consistent on his stroke compared to the previous matches. how did you think of that?
rafa, he's won 52 matches at roland garros and lost one. why is he so good in that place?
yes.
better there.
why?
have you played at night here this tournament?
is there a big difference for you if you go to the night? do you care? what do you like better?
the atmosphere?
he was swinging pretty big, wasn't he? weathered the storm in the first set.
when somebody has a bit of a double fault rash like that, do you almost feel you've earned that by pressurizing the serve?
i want to ask you about del potro. he lost his first match, but he had a great start of the season. do you think this can be the season that he can get closer to you, the top four players?
with dimitrov making a bit of a breakthrough, do you think he's really improving his game? is he any better than when you played anymore brisbane?
you'll play andreas seppi next. can you assess that, a guy who has come into his own the past 12 months?
few points here and there, could have turned it around, couldn't you?
you had way more winners than he did, and obviously way more aces, but that didn't translate into winning the match for you.
so what's the plan? go back and train a bit?
do you like the idea of going to small towns for tennis, or would you rather be in a big city?
you have played just one match, and you're already in the fourth round. how nice is that?
was it very windy?
you're obviously very wellrested now. i know you lost your first i guess match at indian wells. in the long run, does that help you to be very rested, or would you rather keep playing matches?
you play nishikori next.
i think you're 22 against him. can you talk about him? i think you beat him last time in australia.
your first masters 1000 breakthrough came here in 2005. you reached the semifinals, and again the next year. can you just talk about playing here in miami? there are a lot of spanish fans here. talk about the environment compared to other tournaments throughout the year.
without nadal and without federer, does that affect your chances a little more?
looked like another nice day at the office for you today getting through in straight sets. how do you feel like you're playing so far in miami?
i am from mexican tv. we saw a beautiful video that the people from miami make for you. this warm video, how can you tell to the latins who support and love your career? for the latins, what can you say?
you came with a special trophy from indian wells here.
can you explain to us?
this is a bigpicture question. when do you think was the turning point in your tennis career? you have always been sort of hovering there, and then all of a sudden, you know, it seemed like things turned and you're no.1. was it a mental thing? was it a physical change? was it a particular match?
next opponent is tommy haas; a little bit of a change of pace from today.
how would you assess that matchup, and do you maybe go out with a little respect given all he's overcome the last couple of years?
what puts you in a bad mood? are you ever like cranky? dragging around?
did that play out the way you wanted?
what do you need to do to lift it for querrey?
should be a bit of a contrast the next round, no?
changing gears a little bit, could you describe the feeling of what it's like to play roger federer and why it's so hard to play him and what's your most memorable federer match?
everybody back home in canada is very excited about you leading canada historically to their first quarterfinal matchup against italy. any thoughts about your italian opponents and playing them in vancouver?
you have a teammate with jessie levine. what does he add to the team that compliments the canada's davis cup?
once you settled down it was sort of routine, was it?
do you see a bit of you in him in his style of play?
you're up against one of the other players that's coming up that's talked about a lot as a potentially good player, top of the game for the future. you have played them both a couple of times. how would you compare them? which is better?
do you think he deserved the unfriendly reception some of the crowd gave him? was that fair?
did you make it to the heat game last night?
are you happy or disappointed that federer or nadal are no longer, you know, in the future path of you in this tournament? how do you see the path that you have left?
do you think these courts are too slow? would you like hard courts faster than they generally seem to be at the moment?
can you describe what your feeling is to walk on the court to play roger federer?
what's your most memorable match with him?
do you remember your first memory of federer, maybe a conversation? what's your first memory of federer?
do you remember the first famous tennis player you ever met when you were a young boy or first famous tennis player you met or encountered?
what's the greatest moment of your career?
wellplayed.
congratulations. your enthusiasm was wonderful. can you talk about that and what you felt at that moment?
you talked when you were on the court there to the fans about how nice it was and how that worked out for you.
how did that  psychologically did that help a little bit?
when did you last play that well?
the conditions out there today you have played in a lot of tournaments here.
you know how hot and muggy it can get. seems pretty cool.
ramos upset juan monaco today, which really seems like it opens up the field a little bit, right? i know he was in the semi last year. how nice was that for you?
are you playing in doubles?
congratulations on beating new mexico.
maybe that inspires you to some kind of parallel...
are you friends with jeremy lin?
you're playing so well. i'm just curious, is it possible that jim courier may ask you to be back on the davis cup again?
coincidentally your other win against julien came here four years ago, a straight sets win. is there any sort of similarities with today's match compared to the one four years ago?
i know you're a dad now and married. obviously that's nice for you. how does that change things for you as far as being on the tour? they're not here are they?
she's how old?
she's nine months now, okay. and the crowd, they love you. i mean, but it's probably like that everywhere. is it special here or...
i don't know if you keep up at all with the women's side, but can you comment on datekrumm? she saved six match points before she lost to venus yesterday, and she's 42.
can you just talk a little bit about being back here and just what it means to be back at the sony and be able to open up the way you did today?
can you comment on today's match? a couple of opportunities to close it out, and then he came up with some good stuff at those moments.
comment on the conditions. the conditions at indian wells compared to here are just so opposite. what do you prefer playing in?
you touched on the topic of the injuries and everything you have had to endure. have you thought about calling it quits, or is this still just a passion for you here?
you had a big win in indian wells knocking out a top20 player in john isner. what did it mean to get a huge win against a player on home soil and confidence coming here to miami?
on the line of the surgery and somebody suggesting you wouldn't be able to come back and couldn't, how much of your return was to prove others wrong but also to prove to yourself that you still had it very much in you?
and what about simon in the next round?
congratulations, rafa. that was a beautifully fought match out there. just talk about the emotions, you know, for this championship. after the match you threw yourself to the ground. just talk about those emotions.
what are your thoughts on how you were able to win the third set?
you were away from the game for over six months. how hungry were you to feel this again?
hungry or not, it's still a good taste?
you know, you won this tournament before. would you say your game has changed and evolved, and how has it evolved and changed since the last time you won this tournament?
so 13 slams. today you had the entire arena of 23,000 rooting for you. around the world, millions of people love you. what do you think makes you special as a man? why do you think this is happening? why do you think so many people are attracted to you?
you feel pride that again and again you advance your game. is that something that gives you great pride, rafa?
with 13 of those major trophies, i think you only trail pete and roger now in the alltime list. can you give us a sense for what that means to you? can you anticipate catching those guys? i mean, you are only 27.
you have won already wimbledon, australian open, us open, but everybody until last year had considered you mostly the greatest clay court specialist. for you, you were proud of course to have won eight roland garros or whatever. (laughing.) but it's something different now, because you're proving everyone that you're the greatest or one of the greatest also on hard court? does it make a difference for you?
but you were never unbeaten on hard court like this year.
there was a 54point rally in the second set. what was going through your head during that rally? and were you concerned when you were broken that it might mean something larger?
during the match you were down several break points, and i was just wondering what your strategy was, because novak was making some great shots, and you were too, but what was your strategy to come back from break points and save your serve?
with your problems with your knees before this season, you were talking about how the hard courts affected your knees more than other surfaces, but yet you had the bestever year of your career on hard courts this year after all those problems. i'm just wondering, did something change in your strategy on hard courts or your attitude on hard courts to make that possible? it just seems on paper very surprising.
when you won the third set and you were doing a celebration and the crowd is going crazy, can you try and put into words the emotion of that moment and that adrenaline?
what do you remember of watching a year ago the us open finals on television? do you remember what you were thinking, what your emotions were?
do you think too much is made of your comeback? meaning that before you came back, did you really believe that, i'm healthy, i'm still competing for major titles?
did you think before you came back, if i'm healthy, i'm still going to be close to the top of the game competing for major titles?
to an observer, this match was really defined a lot by surges of momentum. you were so dominant in the first set, and then in the second set it seemed almost as if novak took the court away from you of points. and in a way also, you guys have played 37 matches now, which is a record in the open era. you're kind of entering into new territory as a rivalry. within that rivalry, even within the rivalry, you have had moments where you had many wins in a row or streaks. i wondered if you could just talk about your sense of the rivalry and going through this experience with novak and also the changes in momentum.
when do you leave for madrid? after such a long month, how do you feel about playing in a different surface in just three days?
novak's coach said that the biggest challenge for tennis sport is beating rafael nadal in paris. i think we have to modify the statement. beating rafael on any surface can be the biggest challenge in the tennis history, the tennis sport. what is the challenge for you next year? probably making calendar grand slam can be a challenge for rafael nadal?
you had said after the semifinal when asked if you would look forward to playing, you know, the final against novak, you said no. you were quite honest, and you said you'd rather have an easier path to win the championship.
listening to you now and hearing you describe how you match up, and he pushes you to have special, tough matches, in hindsight, looking back with the trophy and having won, is it a little more special now having won that having played novak?
roger said earlier in the tournament that his love for this sport is more important when things are going badly than when they're going well, when he's winning everything. i was just wondering if you feel the same.
two questions: one, i think he broke you three times in a row. do you remember that ever happening? second question: a lot of amazing points out there, but also novak had 50plus unforced errors. were you surprised by that?
just 12 months ago, were there ever any moments that you thought that maybe you would not be able to play this sport again?
when you were injured, were there ever any moments when you were concerned that your body would maybe not allow you to play tennis again?
you said you watched the match last year on tv. you were a great sport. after the match you texted andy congratulating him. have you had a chance to check your texts yet?
$3.6 million is a lot of money for working three tennis tournaments. what are your thoughts about that prize money? are you going to give some to your indian school, and is that school going well in india?
how many chances do you give to yourself to become also an indoor specialist and winning the masters cup? why you haven't won it yet?
each of the remaining men and women have won one grand slam this year. what would winning a second title mean towards determining who had the most successful 2013 season?
i asked you earlier in the tournament about wins in montreal and cincinnati, and i phrased it in such a way as, are they great confidence builders for this. you very clearly said, they're more than that. they're great accomplishments in their own right. then i just heard what you were saying here. so do you think that too many times we make greatness all about grand slams and maybe put too much emphasis on the grand slams?
what's your opinion?
what was the key for you in this match today?
in your opinion, will monday's men's final be a higher quality because you and novak will have tomorrow off to rest, or can you say?
you like the day off?
this will be the 37th time you have played novak. how much do you enjoy playing him?
john mcenroe said that gasquet came to the net, served and volleyed, 18 times, won 18 points
why he wasn't coming in more? do you think it was your strong returns? your passing shots that kept him back? he was scoring a lot serve and volley. were you aware of that?
yes.
a nontennis question: i just wondered what your reaction was to the olympics announcement. were you disappointed?
third.
there is a feeling novak is maybe more nervous on the court this season than past years. do you share it? do you have the feeling that novak is more nervous, tense, on the court than he was last year? do you share this?
you said earlier that you were being very blunt in saying i'd rather face somebody you have an easier chance against. when you are able to prevail over novak to beat him, afterwards, is that victory one you savor more than one over another opponent?
i know it's so soon after your match, but you had a great run here. are you able to look back and take a lot of positives out of the tournament as a whole?
he comes in with such a great record on hard courts, and he hadn't lost serve. you changed that. you could take some small victories out of that, too. you played him well.
judging this year's performance, one of the best year of your career, one semifinal, two fourth round, and wimbledon third round. how are you looking back?
how much of a confidence builder has this tournament been for you?
third game of the fifth set obviously started turning into its own little thing. how did you come back from that after such a long game?
stan said he found you were extremely nervous today. he said maybe because of his game you couldn't find a game plan. was it the maybe reason, especially at the start of the match?
the warning for coaching seemed to take you by surprise. did the umpire explain the reason?
you have gotten through this tournament thus far with relative ease. in hindsight, perhaps is it not such a bad thing to have had a real test like stan gave you today going into a final.
this is four in a row for you. you have been on this stage before. talk about that remarkable achievement.
first of all, congrats. good run.
i think you can say that maybe no one in history has played and actually lost two more notable games than the game today in the fifth set and then that incredible last game of the wimbledon final, which was so historic and so tough for you. can you take a moment and just talk about what it's like to get in the rhythm of these long games and what goes through your mind? can you possibly compare those two incredible games?
you play a lot of guys who come out and they get on fire and they start hitting lines and get a break, whatever, and you outlast them and have to be patient. but today stan's level was so consistently high throughout most of the match. was there any point where you're tempted to panic, or were you thinking, well, gee, i have to be more aggressive because this guy is just playing too well?
going into those break points, especially in the third game of the fifth set, it appeared that when you won the deuce point, got the ad, that it happened quickly, and all of a sudden maybe did you not have enough time to mentally get ready for the next point? it seemed to vanish before you were actually ready.
i was going to ask you that.
you alluded to this a little bit, but the confidence you have entering that fifth set, is that more a function of conditioning or is it experience or an equal combination of both of those things?
there has been a lot of talk about andy murray missing a little bit of edge this week because of what he went through at wimbledon. but you have had a brutal summer as well, playing even more matches than he has. i wonder how mentally fresh you feel at this stage.
you didn't seem to be too happy when he took the medical timeout. what was your reaction?
what do you feel about the monday final? i suppose it's nice to have a day's rest after the semifinal after a match like that, but at the same time, does it give you much time to recover for davis cup?
when you're on the court facing rafa nadal, how would you describe the mental and physical challenges?
what does this battle for ranking of no.1 mean to you?
there was a moment in the match when you were getting the crowd excited. reminded me of the match in 2011 against roger federer. my question is: what role does emotion play for you in the kind of match you played today?
you won the first two sets, lost the next two. going into the fifth set against a guy you have only beaten once before, what's going through your head?
you lost a lot of close fiveset matches in your career. what does it mean to you, this match, and the last match against raonic?
we don't know for sure who your semifinal opponent is, but if it is rafa, your record on the pro tour is not so great, but can you talk about i was trying to be nice but can you talk about the match you played when you were 13?
can you tell us how weird that was?
where was that, do you know?
your record against ferrer wasn't so good, either.
but today what was the difference?
it's been a while since you have been to a semifinal.
that fifth set, you know, it's very hard to put ferrer away, but you showed a level of maturity that, you know, since that all the hard work you have been doing, a lot of fitness. and since that pays off, like how is your confidence in the fifth set? certain times you are playing a little defensive. how did you change to continue being aggressive?
if you play rafa with the record you have had, how do you maintain confidence going into the match? and do you feel you're playing at your highest level you have played in recent years?
do you feel like you're playing at the best you have played in the last few years?
this is the second fivesetter in a row. how are you holding up physically? how are you feeling right now?
how did you make it past hewitt?
sorry?
can you describe your emotions after that? you were out there for almost four hours and there was some fantastic tennis. just describe your emotions.
if i heard right, you were thanking the crowd on court for their providing you energy.
novak got through 63, 6love 6love. he is your next opponent. talk about atmosphere. it will be on ashe. just talk about what you expect in that match.
what helped you, even though you're down in the fourth set and fifth set, to stay strong and ultimately come back and win the match?
do you feel like you had a very good rhythm and you seemed very aggressive in going for your shots.
what do you think you will need to do besides the obvious of play great tennis? considering your own game, what are the things you're going to need to do to beat novak?
is there anything today that you say, i have to correct that for this match? is there anything that you fell short of today?
it's a cruel sport obviously sometimes. can you talk us through the emotions of all that, the last couple of sets?
one of the greatest moments of your career obviously came here when you won the title. how would you compare, you know, today? was this almost as painful as that was exhilarating?
those crucial games, 4all in the fourth, 5all in the fifth, and errors are coming, is that just tightness from wanting it too much or is it fatigue? what sort of causes those little hiccups sometimes?
now that it seems like you're pretty healthy again, what's the biggest difference between you now and you when you won this title?
people who have been significant in your past here are all retiring: sampras, now blake. all these guys are getting older. i wonder, do you have a ceiling? do you want to be here when they finish the roof when they in 2016, 2017?
what does this mean to you, this run? you played great tennis and obviously have come back from the surgery and so forth. in general  i know it's hard at this point having just lost the match  but looking back at the last week, talk about what that's meant to you in terms of your confidence and ambition?
who's the best tennis player, nadal, sampras, or federer?
you say this gives you some confidence and everything. talk a little bit about that in terms of the davis cup that's coming up, the tie next week.
does the mental aspect of the game in terms of closing out matches at all get tougher as you have been around longer? you're young you don't realize what's at stake as much, but further into your career...
presumably when you're with a team at the davis cup, you're experienced, a little older. do you relish that role?
pretty tough. new york crowd breaks out the, aussie, aussie chant. what goes through your head?
in 2001 when you won here you were much younger and on your own. now you're traveling with your family. does that give you more perspective about the tennis losses?
how difficult it's going to be to maintain this level on clay court? what's your thought about polish team? not sure about janowicz; he's injured.
cahill was out watching you today. did you know he was coming? i guess even though you didn't get the result, was it kind of nice to have that kind of support from fellow aussie?
has anyone ever played better against you?
is it possible to play well in the fourth round after having played five sets first round, second round, and third round? it was going to be hard to be ever have a chance today, i guess.
what did you think about the atmosphere against smyczek? he was saying it felt a little like davis cup. did you agree with that?
what do you think about his potential as a player?
nole won the first 25 points today on his serve. was there something he was doing especially well on that?
when is the last time you played that great?
you played against sousa, granollers, and now youzhny. do you think you have a real advantage physically?
on court you said you played flawless after 3all in the first set. is that as good as you can play, those last two sets? can you play better?
you seemed especially sharp at the net today. is that something you have been working on at all, bringing a little bit of that variety perhaps into your game?
your opponent was getting almost a bronx cheer. have you ever been on the short end of a 60, 60, at any time in your pro career?
along those lines, can you remember the last time that you felt you were really in the zone in a match and playing flawlessly?
you were, let's say, a skinny guy who grew up by a pizza parlor in the serbian mountains.
i will send you a copy.
but then you end up at the un. what was that like? what was the coolest part of that?
your message is that sports can be a role model?
if i could ask you a question about rafa. you played him not so long ago on hard courts. it appears he's not serving as hard as he used to. i'm wondering if you agree with that, and what he's doing effectively with his serve versus in the past, because he's holding quite regularly?
you had some amazing fights against federer here and other tournaments. what do you think when you see him go down against robredo on hard court here?
you had a great game, especially after the first set, but i was wondering if there was anything you thought that you weren't happy with that you might focus on for your next match.
today the nominations came out for davis cup. could you talk briefly about the semifinal, and also that your team will be without viktor and that although you have a home tie, their team is mostly serbian?
what does it mean to beat roger federer for the first time in 10 tries?
roger said you didn't play any different than the previous times; that it was all him making the mistakes. do you agree with that? what made the difference this time?
we're seeing a lot of the older players doing well in this tournament. what do you put your success down to?
did you have a feeling going into the match it would be different this time around?
this has been a big year for you coming back, tournament wins. you had a great victory in the french open, epic match. could you talk about what this year has meant to you.
lleyton hewitt has had a similar comeback from injury. what have you made of his performances here so far?
when you had the match with evans, it was a similar style. you play on armstrong and beat evans. no way you can compare evans to federer. do you feel in some ways the match with evans actually prepared you for roger today? do you feel you had an advantage coming into this match?
not to be too philosophical, when a match is that close, is it hard to figure out why one guy won and the other one lost?
he was getting a lot of looks in your service games in the fifth. just a matter of your serve tiring out a little bit?
you seemed to play well fending off all those breakpoints. any consolation in that?
you looked a bit tired on your serve, but you looked fresher than he did.
why did you feel heavy?
davis cup coming up. how are you seeing that in terms of how your prospects are looking brighter, you and vasek after montral?
how soon do you get on clay?
losing after you have a match point, how much tougher is that?
have you talked to your coach after the match?
what do you think will be the basic stuff about the chat?
he really kept going on the backhand chip return of serve. are you saying you went there too much?
thinking of how you went out of wimbledon, no fun losing this one.
it was a tough match for you today.
so what was the difference between winner and loser, do you think?
with the rain delay and so on, any effect on you?
you played on grandstand today. grandstand is going to be moved the end of next year. what do you feel about that court?
obviously a difficult day for you. a disrupting day as well. did the fact you had to switch courts, was that a difficulty at all?
what went wrong for you? physically your game, you couldn't find a rhythm?
do you think also it's a matter of confidence at this point that when things go wrong, you start to, i don't know, get angry at yourself or nervous, you're not as evoluted as you normally are?
being more negative?
was the back an issue today?
anything going on there?
i'm sure you're not happy with your performance, but what is going on through your mind?
what about the anticipation, maybe the disappointment of not getting into the quarterfinals against rafa?
the conditions seemed slow. did you have a chance to practice before the rain? how did you feel during the warmup?
did you feel all right during the practice?
you're known as such a great closer, 2 for 16 on breakpoints.
no. could you talk about your difficulty on breakpoints? secondly, were you overall surprised by your performance today, by the result?
i know it's right after the match, but do you anticipate you're going to make any changes to your training program or regimen?
i don't know if the masters cup is one of your goals or not, but you are a little bit in trouble. would you change maybe your schedule in order to do that, or is not really that important for you to be in the top 8 at the end of the year?
you played robredo a lot in the past. did he do anything differently, show anything different from when you played him in the past?
you're such an instinctive player. the game always has seemed to come so easily to you. do you think it's even more difficult, someone who is a natural touch player when the timing is off, it even looks worse when we're used to you hitting the ball so sweetly?
what was that like for you out there?
what was that like, being the last american guy?
what in your mind did he do well or you not do well in the fifth set?
were you surprised he could hang in there? he played two fivesetters coming in.
you were talking about having another chance to break. there was one point i think you were down to one challenge where it looked like i think it was a backhand might've caught the line. do you remember if you thought about asking for that one?
it was 43, two breakpoints, and it was the second one.
you only had one left. it was sort of a tough one.
didn't cross your mind then?
obviously it's not on you that you were the last american in there. since you are, do you go around thinking about american tennis very much or are you just doing your own thing?
this is the first time there's not been an american man in the fourth round of a grand slam ever.
what were some of the new experiences for you being the last american guy here?
were you feeling any pressure out there? didn't look like it.
what was it like to have the entire place cheering for you?
not to pin it on you again, but you see some positive signs. it's fair to say we're sort of hitting bottom here and the only way is up.
i was talking a little bit more about american tennis, men's tennis in general.
17.
how did this tournament make you reassess yourself?
fall schedule?
will you eagerly be awaiting the rankings next week?
there's no rankings this week, so you have to wait.
different kind of match today. pretty pleased with how you handled it?
i think 31 net approaches or something like that?
is the net rushing because of the opponent or something you're trying to do in general?
was there any danger of a letdown for you given how big it was friday night?
with all the surgeries you had, was there any moment you thought, i won't be able to come back?
when roger was in here he mentioned a hit you guys had on monday that went for about three hours.
tell us a bit about that.
with regard to roger, a lot of people looking ahead to a possible rafa/roger match and talking about who could be the greatest of all time. any thoughts on that?
if it would be tommy haas in the next round, you haven't played him like in nine years. you both have a lot in common with the injuries, the age, and doing well lately. what are your thoughts?
why do you think more and more top players are almost 30 years old?
is it nice not to go playing a young buck this time, either way?
roger said earlier this year you were sort of a role model for him. have you heard that?
have you heard that he said that?
before you got here, had you entertained the prospect of being here in the fourth round?
how was your play today, and how do you feel like going to the next round?
the first set you went to a tiebreaker, but after that you seemed to have the match pretty well in control. were you surprised that he sort of backed off after that first set?
were you surprised? normally a left hander has a good advantage in the ad court. he seemed to double fault a lot there today.
how do you grade the performance today?
did you figure him out more as you went along?
did you have enough suntan lotion on today?
possibly gasquet in the next round or tursunov. what do you think about that?
how is your confidence level, given the quarter that you're in?
how are you feeling?
we're here in newyork, kind of helterskelter, loud, noisy. well, it's america, and america and canada sort of have the friendly rivalry. just talk about how it affects your career being a canadian player? do you think it would be different if you were an american? the pluses and minuses of the fact that your parents moved to canada and you're playing obviously as a canadian.
so are you saying it's more relaxed just to be a canadian, just a little bit under the radar screen compared to what americans would be?
your comfort level at the us open compared to any of the other grand slams, how would it be?
obviously davis cup is two weeks from today. is it anywhere in the back of your mind or are you 100% us open?
talk about the heat today and the conditions.
heading into the second week, how do you feel the level of your game is at?
did you watch any of the del potrohewitt match yesterday evening?
nobody knows what will happen tomorrow, but when you're seeing hewitt playing at his age, can you imagine yourself playing at his age here in the us open, or do you think it's very improbable?
32, 33.
what are your thoughts when you see the bryan brothers, who are now going for the grand slam in doubles?
what goes through your mind when you see them play, if you get the chance to see them play at all?
would it be a little bit of a relief if you didn't have to face isner who is in a struggle right now? how would you feel if you did have to face him?
one of the papers published an interview today with francis roig, and he said when you were off for the year you did a lot of target practice trying to hit water bottles and knock one over. is that an important part of your training? roig told the wall street journal start of the year you were trying to hit targets on the court, water bottles.
slightly related to that, you're sort of four weeks into this hard court season. happily it's going very well. are you practicing any differently because of the issues that you have had obviously in the last 12 months to kind of preserve yourself and your body and stuff like that?
you have been invincible on your service through the tournament, you know, not a single loss of serve.
it's coming without the benefit of that many aces. last time you came, you brought a big, big serve into flushing meadows. can you talk again on how you're using that first serve to advantage? it's working.
is it your accuracy or the way you're kind of changing the serve?
what is it about your game that seems to have matched up against john so well here the last couple of years?
what was happening when the chair umpire went over to talk to his box?
if tim smyczek loses tomorrow, there's a chance that no americans would be in the second week of any major this year for the first time ever. what would you make of that, and your part of that?
what do you make of playing nadal?
how much was the thigh at the end a factor?
before the match?
when you broke in the fourth?
were you trying to engage the crowd?
what effect did your previous match and the way the crowd reacted have on your thinking today in making those moves to get the crowd charged up and yourself charged up?
what were the reasons, you think, for getting that amped up?
do you think he had confidence from the fact he beat you here last year?
smyczek is the last player remaining in the draw, american player. i know you don't really care what he's doing, but if he loses it will be another first. we've had a man in the fourth round here at least since the open era began.
obviously you know tim. first time in the fourth round of a slam. what do you think of his being this far in the tournament and his chances against granollers?
you were saying you were feeling a little bit beat up and it's been a long year. what are you going to do now, and is there anything you can take from this to help yourself be a little bit more prepared and not feel this way at the end of the season?
obviously we talked in cincinnati about your record in the u.s. has been better than outside it. asia and european indoors are circuits that should suit you well. how about your focus to get big results there?
you guys out there are under incredible pressure. you had a problem, if i read it right, with a late volley; venus had a problem the other night with her volley; same as roddick. is that a particularly tough shot to execute at crunch time?
i'm talking about executing
yes.
yeah. you netted a volley.
yeah.
you said you were going to get away from tennis, but one tennis story after you've left this tournament will be the bryan brothers going for the grand slam. can you just share your thoughts on what they mean to the sport and on their pursuit of the grand slam?
speaking of football, if you can transform a tennis player into the nfl, choice of maybe nadal or andy roddick, maybe juan martin or somebody else, who would you think to make a switch pretty effectively into the nfl?
would you root for him?
have you ever seen a chair umpire walk over and talk to people about their cheering in the stands or anything like that?
to your box.
i think so.
at the ncaa championships?
you were saying that your goal is to get back into the top 10. today you used too much energy on the court. do you feel perhaps you're putting too much pressure on yourself, and that's why you exerted yourself too much out there on the court today?
a question nothing to do with tennis. i understand you have been going to donate 20% of the prize money to america's vet dogs.
could you talk a little bit about why you're doing that and what your work is with the organization?
on the delay, same sort of issues as last time?
how was it? your second fivesetter after reynolds here last year. 20, not bad.
first time at this stage of a major.
how does it feel?
that was going to be my question. you just played four hours on a friday night in new york. what are your plans after this?
what does it mean to you to make it to the third round of a slam? you're not young.
are you still in disbelief or what?
you have granollers. do you know him?
you've seen him play, obviously.
good serve.
loud grunter.
it's just you and sock and isner left.
kohlschreiber.
planning on running out of gas at more majors?
he was the guy driving the car that rescued you?
he's worried about you.
there's some chatter that maybe the car broke down.
it was not mechanical?
all these prize money increases, not a bad payday for you.
do you have your sights on anything?
could you bring us up to speed on your wisconsin connections, background.
what town?
did you play much in the tennis center there? are you a badger fan?
when you saw your draw here, duckworth, bogomolov, not seeds, did you feel like you had more of an opportunity here?
it sort of continues. another unseeded guy next round.
what do you want to do in the next year or two? talk about your hopes.
will you play a bunch of challengers after the open? go out to california?
do you know what you're playing? tiburon?
for top 100, i think you're projected at 100.
but the rankings don't come out for another week.
you get into slams directly at 105.
his level seemed to drop a bit in the second, but then up in the third. was that how you saw it?
you've had a lot of tough matches on that court. is it kind of difficult not to have that in your mind?
did you feel focus was an issue at all for you?
you seemed frustrated at some points.
we're doing a story about the evolution of racquets. how was it for you since you started to play to nowadays, and how does it help you in your game?
you're the only one of the top seeds so far to play out on armstrong. were you hoping you'd seen the back of that court now that you're defending champion?
don't you mind all the movement and everything that's going on all the time? doesn't seem the best stewarded of courts?
you said ahead of the tournament it was your first time coming back as a defending grand slam champion, and with that of course being in new york, there were a lot of ancillary things you had to do; those things could be a bit of a distraction. is that largely behind you now?
how would you assess the way that you're playing right now? pleased with the way you're playing? are there things that are of a concern to you?
another mayer next. florian is quite a tricky player.
specific challenges to play three such different players backtoback?
have you spoken to dan about robredo at all?
will you try and watch it?
fourth on armstrong, so tomorrow night.
a question about football. i know you like it. what do you expect from the match between scotland and belgium next week?
it looked like the first set was a bit of a struggle. how did you feel out there today physically and in your game?
question away from tennis. neven markovic, your close friend, is playing football in switzerland, second league.
can you talk a little bit about your friendship and about your common story.
you mentioned the tricky conditions. is it just the wind, do you mean, or was there something else that bothered you?
a little followup on the wind. i mean, you prepare for various things in your training. is there any way you can practice or prepare for dealing with the wind?
away from tennis, i would assume your uniqlo deal lets you walk into any store and order anything you want.
yeah.
now that you have adopt this had glutenfree diet for a few years, what are some of your favorite dishes and what are some of the dishes you miss the most?
are there foods you miss having?
i tried your diet for a couple of days. i found it to be challenging.
your diet. i did the whole thing from the book.
you can read all about it. well, my question is, you know, a lot of people talk about gluten, you also don't eat dairy, so not much with caffeine. were you a big caffeine drinker before that?
i found the honey quite challenging, but maybe it's my palate.
there was actually a new story the other day that uk officials are investigating whether there is fraud with exports of manuka honey out of new zealand.
at some point today you looked like maybe you had breathing issues or something. was it the weather or anything else?
a lot of work out there today. talk about the match.
the tiebreakers in the first two sets, what is it that makes a difference?
between winning and losing.
do you feel like you were more confident in the tiebreakers than he was? did you see any weakness?
you played in this tournament now 11 years in a row. last year you had a breakthrough when you beat roger. do you feel more confident this year based on the fact you were able to have a breakthrough last year?
how important is experience when you're playing in a pressured environment for a twoweek period?
are things clicking for you right now?
what do you know about your next opponent, benneteau?
such a good start. bit of a concentration lapse at the start of the second, couldn't quite get it back?
you said 'afraid.' did you feel you can hit it in?
were you surprised by his confidence? he seemed very pumped out there.
where do you feel he hurt you the most?
does it surprise you that he's 179 in the world?
your hitting partner is a brit?
he knew him pretty well, didn't he?
what is your brit partner's name?
there's more tennis to play this year. it's obviously the end of the grand slam run. could you assess your season.
any sense why so many ups and downs?
you mentioned davis cup just now. you and janowicz are the young group of guys people have been talking about. have you been following his year since the breakout in paris? i can't remember whether you played before. what do you think of his game? talk a little bit about the polish team.
last year you said you played too much. that was part of your issue. what do you blame this year?
the issue with your dad has dragged on for a lot of months now. are you looking forward to that being resolved to get it done?
you spoke before about slowing the pace of the ball down a little bit, you're not sure why you do that sometimes. is that something you're working on removing from your game or will you continue to change the pace of the ball?
are you going to be able to watch rusty tomorrow?
will you get a chance to play doubles in the davis cup?
how do you like playing here at the tennis center?
you're one of two guys playing singles, doubles and mixed in the tournament.
why do you think that's so rare today?
you wouldn't have played doubles otherwise?
can you see anyone winning all three titles of a major anytime soon?
talk about your match a little bit, singles.
feel better than the first round?
have you played tipsarevic?
what do you know about him?
did you watch james' match last night?
from your hotel?
what were you thinking as it wrapped up?
a lot of nerves in that match knowing it could be his last match tonight?
sort of cool to have been there for his last one?
did he get much sleep?
do you have any idea what he's been doing since last night?
talk about the progress of the americans in tennis, you and isner and the others.
on paper you have a pretty decent draw. the next round will be a test and battle. how much are you looking forward to getting to the latter stages of a major?
has james given you anything in terms of your game on the court?
can you just talk about the match. lot of close sets.
you sound like you felt like you were playing well last round. did you feel the same today? did you feel your level dropped?
for this year, it's been sort of an upanddown year, especially the slams. paris was pretty good, but the other ones disappointing. fair to say?
mardy was talking in indian wells about how guys don't understand the pressure that comes with being american no.1 till they get it. you got it in march. was that something that made this year tougher at all?
i don't know what your expectations are for yourself. there's a lot of people that would say you would have made it past the fourth round at a major at this point. what do you think is missing to get to the next step?
what are you looking to build on specifically from this match today?
is it disappointing to not perform like you would like to at this event?
you always seem to deal with wins or defeats fairly well. you seem to be a relatively relaxed guy. how do you balance putting pressure on yourself and staying fairly chill?
where do you think that answer would be? is that in talking to a coach?
any of the offcourt stuff affect your performance here?
when serena left the court, she said it was really difficult conditions, very windy. how did you find the conditions today?
pleased with the match?
can you talk about how fitness preparation and training have changed since you arrived on the tour?
i heard that you have lined up daniel evans to practice with. i don't know whether that happened or not with the rain, but he's just beaten bernard tomic, so after the next round you could actually end up playing him.
have you seen much of his game? what do you think of it? would you normally line up someone to practice with who is in your half of the draw?
interviewed maria bueno. she had nice things to say about you, and said when you're in brazil i have to see your backhand. let's go out and hit some.
if you could see some strokes or hit with some fabulous players who in the past you never hit with...
as a student of the game, if you can play against borg's backhand or jack kramer's serve, is there one or two that you might enjoy in your imagination playing, going up against and seeing what it's like?
business question. i see the famous federer cap. so popular. did you design that or who was the designer? how many units have you sold of it?
has nike told you how many units you have sold of that?
can you talk about what kind of influence arthur ashe had on you both as a player and your offthecourt endeavors?
with your recent meeting with nadal, how much did you take away from the state of your own game and the state of his game? secondly, just when you look at the overall season by your standards, it hasn't been the best, the actions you've taken with the other tournaments and testing with the racquet. how much of that is your own sense of searching or questioning, you know, where you are?
is that the best win of your life?
was that a nerves thing in the first set?
at one point you had been broken, 30love down and said you've got to get the ball in the fing court. are you pleased at how well, you pulled yourself together?
have you played in a tiebreak, in a pressure situation, as well as that?
roger federer said some nice things about you today after you hit with him yesterday. you could meet him in the fourth round. could you talk about that, without looking too far ahead. something to aim at, isn't it?
when you look back at what happened to you in the challengers, losing those finals, having had match points in both, is that a characterbuilding thing? that strengthened you coming in here?
how was hitting with federer? was that paul annacone who set that up?
did paul ask you?
can you talk us through the sensitivity in the medical timeout?
have you had that before?
there was a tweet about you trying to practice with tomic in miami and him saying no.
have you spoken to bernard about it?
this year, was it?
how do you actually feel you are playing?
exciting to be in the third round of a grand slam?
robredo is up at the moment. assuming he wins, is he a guy you've had anything to do with or know anything about?
maybe have a chat with andy, because andy played him at wimbledon.
did andy tell you anything about tomic?
you going to let us know?
with the heat today, your conditioning must have been pretty good. reasonably long match.
are you in the best shape of your life, would you say?
what's the reaction been like back home?
give us a blowbyblow on getting here this morning.
what time did this happen?
were you off the freeway?
of the freeway?
what was your driver's explanation for running out of gas?
this is probably a dumb question, but has that ever happened to you before?
generally for transportation at tournaments, is it usually without issue?
talk a little bit about the match.
what happened after? you were getting treatment.
where were you cramping?
you couldn't grip the racquet?
ever cramp in that area before?
it was a pretty lengthy fourth set.
50 minutes.
back to the transport. you play a lot of different level tournaments. when you're not at a slam for transport, how do you usually get to and from tournaments?
usually it's a big perk when you don't have to do that though, right?
did your driver seem surprised she had run out of gas?
do you know where you were exactly?
what was your reaction during all that?
you weren't originally given a wildcard.
what do you think about your next match?
what do you make of each of them?
do you think you'll be checking gas gauges from now on?
other players joke about it when you got here?
any prime material from anybody?
do you think your driver was joyriding around and ran out of gas before she came to pick you up?
how was it out there today?
ten years ago was the last time an american man won a major. you're the last american junior male to win the us open junior title. what do you have to say about that?
two weeks from now, it's going to be the usual suspects. are they so above us that we're hoping to play for runnerup status?
seemed like pete and andre got to that level a lot faster.
what do you like about new york, this tournament?
in your own game, where do you feel like you are? how do you feel about your season so far?
on the women's side of american tennis, there's so many young americans. a little less so on the men's side. can you reflect on that, the issues involved in that?
when we see you a year from now here, where would you like to be in the atp ranking?
when did you make the decision to turn pro instead of going to college, was that something you discussed with your family or was it a decision between you and your coach? what advice would you give upandcoming kids who are getting ready to make that decision?
do you ever regret your decision?
what schools were you considering?
you have a distinctive last name. ever had a foe with a more distinctive pair of socks than today?
ever seen an opponent with socks like he was wearing out there today?
how much do you feel the absence of roddick and james blake, mardy has been off tour, do you feel anything? are you young guys in your own world doing your own thing that it doesn't have that much impact?
how tough were the conditions out there today generally?
would you say the serve was the big weapon today?
how close do you think you are now to winning one of these big ones?
do you have to wait until those top two or three fade a little bit, or do you think you can raise your level to that?
were you a little surprised at how much of a game this guy gave you in his first grand slam match?
how much did the serve help today? maybe a bit more than normal?
you hit a few very nice backhand down the lines, but on the whole what would you say about your game today?
what would you consider to be a good us open for you this year?
speaking of tough to say, if i could just go back to the situation in montreal that happened in the quarterfinal. obviously just sort of happened real quickly. you made some comments afterwards that you wouldn't have approached it differently. have you had a chance to reflect on it? if that occurred again would you call the...
andujar in the next round. are you a bit surprised it's not de bakker, and how do you feel about andujar?
there are three 22 years olds now in the top 25: you, jerzy, and dimitrov. do you keep an eye on those two? is there any sense that this is your new peer group rising through the ranks?
to reach your incredible level in this sport, everyone gets a tremendous amount of advice as they emerge. if you could focus on like the one or two best pieces of advice that you've gotten...
how do you think you carried that out since san jose?
djokovic bought a tournament in serbia, as you know, and we're desperate to get a tournament back in the bay area where you've kicked butt. would you consider underwriting a tournament and bringing the tournament back then?
maybe in the future?
a little bit of ice on the knee. how about the neck? shoulder?
we do that all the time. how often do you do it?
no, how often? once a year? twice a year?
talk a little bit about the match today.
you have known james for a long, long time and been in a lot of different experiences with him. what's the best one or two stories you can come up with that reveal james blake as a guy or player?
do you sense how sort of the tide is changing? obviously andy pulls out of the game last year and now james and mardy obviously has not really been active. do you sense how things are changing and that the focus is on you and john in terms of american tennis?
have you lost much money to him?
smart move.
i'm sure in your career you have had a lot of back and forths, both great wins and some setbacks. but over the years, can you think of one or two pieces of good advice that you have gotten from coaches, family members, fellow players, something that's stuck with you a little bit?
what's the joy that you experience on the tour? what are the biggest problems?
john was just in here, and a lot of reporters were asking him about with andy retiring last year and james retiring this year, you and he are the two seeded guys now for the country. do you feel that added pressure and added excitement out there?
what's the update on your social life? you're engaged? do you have a date? what's shaking?
i did want to follow up from the train of thought we had the other day, which was just briefly before. james said that he'll miss the big moments, the match points, the breakpoints. talk about just your mindset at that point.
good start, john? feeling good about the match?
how did you feel about making a switch from ashe to the grandstand because of the rain?
you have had some incredible life experiences with james. could you take a minute and share one or two of your favorite james blake stories?
what does he mean to the tour? what has he meant to the tour?
you spoke a few minutes ago about the state of your game today. what is the state of your game in general, and what do you think you have most improved in?
with andy not here this year, does it feel a little different for you being as you are the best american here obviously, clearly? does it put a little more responsibility or feel...
in the tournaments leading up, obviously the two finals, how much confidence can you derive from that coming into this one?
rafa has been playing great tennis. you had an opportunity to face him in a final. how much of a learning experience is it when you go up against one of the best players ever, peaking right now, and to face him in a final coming into a grand slam?
you played kevin in the atlanta final, who of course had a fabulous collegiate career like you. just talk about college as an option. is it still viable? downside? upside?
is there sometimes more pressure when there are 5,000 fans in athens rooting for you? talk about that and the pressure.
speaking of colleges, what are your thoughts on georgia's football opener?
james was a tarheel and you're a dog. did that get to be dicey when you're going back and forth with james blake in terms of college...
you had the crowd behind you today obviously, and i think most of the time when you play here you do. newyork crowd is kind of notoriously rowdy. do you feel like u.s. tennis players have an advantage when they play in newyork?
when you see guys like ryan harrison and rhyne williams go out in the first round, i know you say you don't feel any added pressure, but it diminishes the number of americans in the draw. do you feel that coming into today, and what do you think of those guys going forward?
you did a really good job moving forward in the court. was that the game plan coming in?
were you fazed much by having to switch schedule?
were you pleased to hear they're going to put a roof on the stadium?
some players are interested in the glutenfree diet. what do you think about that?
with james blake announcing yesterday his plans to retire after this tournament, what are your thoughts on what he's meant to the game?
can you talk specifically about james' forehand. how would you compare it with the other big ones you've faced as a weapon?
(question about practicing after match today.)
james is at a stage in his life where he doesn't have the passion to want to continue. it's not physical. with yourself, is it unforeseeable right now for you to say you would ever lose the passion to play this game or do you see that day someday coming?
is your passion as high as it's ever been?
what do you think about berlocq? you played against him once in rome. what do you think about the thursday match?
like a father, which lesson do you take from sports after so many years which you would like to give to your daughters?
very disappointing result, i guess, for you.
were you surprised at all by the level that he played at?
did you know much about him before? had you seen him?
were you surprised on court about how well he came out and played such a big match his first us open?
do you have any physical issues this summer?
do you plan to play davis cup?
i mean, which way these results or these weeks impact the chances of japan in the next tie?
how do you see tokyo for the olympic bid, and if you spoke with rafa or david?
how do you see tokyo for the olympic bid?
do you think that japan is going to be the favorite in the davis cup tie?
how much did you miss this place last year?
150 and the two wins coming in on hard court, do you think you're playing the best hard court tennis of your career?
your level of confidence coming in this year...
what are your thoughts on what james blake has meant to men's tennis and to the tour in general?
in recent years some players have tried the glutenfree diet. i was wondering if at some point you were interested in that or not at all?
how do you work to stay happy, and how do you work to be mentally fresh?
american men's tennis, they're looking for the next one. ryan, what does he have to do to get into the upper class?
what aspects of your game were working best for you today and what do you think you need to improve on in the later rounds of the tournament?
how tough was it for you to get rafa in the first round?
what are you telling yourself going into a match like this?
you played him before. is he doing anything different?
have you lost any faith? you struggled a bit this year. have you lost faith you're going to be able to make a big breakthrough?
obviously james is retiring. you just mentioned you're 21. what kind of effect has he had on your career?
the season is not over, but the grand slam season is over. how do you feel about where you are right now in 2013?
do you feel like you got some good lessons out of the first six months of the year or do you want to wash it away?
your success, are you saying you were coasting a little bit? it had gone to your head a little bit?
is there something particular you're going to focus on now?
for the match tonight, talk about your opponent. only 18 years old. what do you make of his game?
with all of the traveling you do as a pro tennis player, when you do long flights to asia or australia, what do you find is the best way to get over jetlag?
you've reached the quarterfinals or better in the last seven grand slams. do you feel that you're this close to actually winning one?
you had some big losses to rafa this year. how difficult is it to get by not only rafa the way he's playing now, but andy is playing fantastic tennis, novak...
there is that gap that might exist between you and no.4. there's some space you're not able to bridge?
rafa says he's always looking to improve.
your hard court game has also gotten much better in the last 12 months. you got to the finals of miami; you played a great match against murray. you're saying they're better than you, but it seems like the gap is closing.
rafa had that extended knee injury. the way he plays tennis, to see him come back, people thought he couldn't be the same player. he's playing the best tennis of his career.
rafa, it seemed like it was a very emotional victory for you, you know, falling to your back after match point. can you describe what was going through your mind at that time and what this title means to you?
rafa, the last time somebody won montreal and cincinnati, the guy won also the us open. do you know that?
what problems does isner's serve present beyond the obvious speed, especially on the hard court?
rafa, i know you've had tough matches against john before, but do you feel like he's become a more complete player?
now, after last year missing a lot because of the injury and coming back and having a phenomenal year, not that you need motivation from your internal self to want to win, but how have the fans both on the court and their response, on facebook and twitter, to this great year helped you and made it even sweeter?
rafa, in your experience, why is it so difficult to win both canada and cincinnati back to back? is it the different conditions, different balls, time of the season?
rafa, this year you won more masters 1000 on hard court than on clay. that's a little bit surprising, no?
maybe improving on hard court, what i mean.
rafa, when you're facing a player like john with a big serve like that, what do you tell yourself to play calm in those tiebreak moments?
rafa, when you look at the top 30 and you look at some of the younger guys, do you kind of pick out raonic, janowicz, and dimitrov as maybe the next wave of future champions? or are they the ones that stick out to you?
raonic, jerzy janowicz, and grigor dimitrov do you see them as the next wave of future champions in the game?
are they the guys you would pick out or somebody else you see?
last week you came from montreal saying you didn't know what to expect and you were prepared that you could have lost early. but now in two weeks, you played ten matches and also played some doubles. how do you feel physically? how are you progressing from a physical point of view, and how does this affect you going into new york?
john, you got a taste of it yesterday when novak double faulted in the tiebreaker, but what was going through your head when del potro double faulted on that match point?
john, in atlanta, you were winning, but you were playing pretty long matches, a lot of small margins. seems like in cincy, you've been playing from the baseline pretty well and giving yourself much more cushion a lot of times in these sets. do you feel like you're playing that much better over the last month?
from a technical perspective, what were you most pleased about today?
john, as you're going up to shake your opponent's hand after a big win like this, what's going through your head?
yesterday you said your record in the u.s. is shockingly different from your record outside of the u.s. did you find any explanation of that?
john, on that 54 game, he double faulted on match point, but overall in the whole game, i think he double faulted one other time. at 3015, he had a routine forehand that he missed. and even on the excellent point that you broke, he had a couple of chances to take charge of that point, and he backed off. do you think overall he got a little bit tight on that last game? did it feel like that to you on the court or not?
john, you mentioned the sun a couple times. was the breeze any kind of a concern on your tosses down there also?
john, what does a second masters final mean to you, and what would a title mean to you at this stage of your career?
your thoughts on nadal and berdych each?
john, juan martin was very complimentary of you in the press conference. he called you a big guy and was proud of you for the win. have you guys always had a good relationship?
john, any concerns about winstonsalem next week and your participation there?
rafa, in the first set, it looked like you had a hard time finding the range on your shots, like your forehand was sailing long and your backhand was landing short. was there a problem with your range at the start of the match?
rafa, how would you compare how you served in the first set and the third set? it seemed like roger was really anticipating your second serve more than the first.
rafa, how do you think that you turned that match around? at what point, and what adjustments were you able to make?
you said it took about a set and a half to get the moves down to actually start returning the serve better. at that point, do you think the caliber of his serve dipped a little bit, or was it mostly you making those adjustments?
rafa, for next week's rankings, for the first time, roger is going to be out of the top 5 in about 11 years. just wondering if that ranking has any significance at this point of his career and what it reflects.
at this time in his career, does the ranking mean anything?
rafa, you played so many meaningful finals with roger. now you're meeting him in the quarterfinal. did you approach it any different being a quarterfinal versus a final?
rafa, your next opponent is tomas berdych. can you talk about that matchup and what you're looking forward to doing in that match.
andy, you said beforehand sometimes you view this tournament as fine tuning your match before the us open. did you achieve any of that today?
andy, tomas has a pretty good overall record against you head to head, and you knew that going in. but with respect to the quicker conditions and everything, were there any things that you were going to do a little bit differently against him given the conditions here?
is it a bit difficult out there with all the noise that is generated at center court? it seems like a disco sometimes out there when you're trying to concentrate as a player.
you've got to concentrate even more so and try to block out all the extraneous stuff that's happening around you out in that grandstand? there seemed to be a lot of movement, a lot of noise.
you mentioned a couple questions ago that it was very quick out there today. this is your second consecutive match on grandstand. was the speed of the court, was that actually quicker today than your previous match the last round?
will you take a couple of days off now before you start practicing for the open in?
can you compare this win to when you beat him at indian wells, and also just to other big wins like roddick at the us open.
john, it's not necessarily a usual match for you. you had a ton of breakpoint opportunities throughout the match. you were getting a lot of looks at his serve. what was getting you that many looks, keeping you from converting, and then finally broke through at the end?
being more aggressive and running around, taking cuts at returns is what you think accounts for this good record lately, as you mentioned?
john, were you surprised that you didn't go to a tiebreaker at the end?
john, how would you rate your form today in terms of like best match that you've played since...
what do you mean a guy like you?
john, i know, when it was brought up earlier in the week you were fairly dismissive of no americans in the top 20 thing, saying it didn't apply to you. you've gotten two top10 wins this week and it's been one of your best in a while. do you think that was bulletin board material for you in the back of your mind?
last time you beat djokovic is when you broke into the top 10 the first time. can you just in general terms explain why the dips happened since then?
john, i don't want to cut short your enjoyment of this win, but can you talk a little bit about your next match. that's going to be a tough one coming up.
is there anything you might adjust from that match going into tomorrow?
he's talked about having some problems with his left wrist a little bit this week. he's had injury problems before. he had back problems in d.c. and stuff. is that the kind of thing you would ever look to exploit in a match, or are you just not that xs and os in general?
john, there was a time violation that novak got there in the third set, and it sounded like you kind of backed him up in terms of his frustration with getting the violation with the crowd going nuts and stuff. can you talk about that a little.
would you want to see it like the clock starts when the umpire announces the score and go from there?
because then the crowd would have died down by then.
you had your first serve going at 74% today. when about in the match do you realize that, okay, it feels good today? and do you look at your serve as independent from the rest of your game; whereas, you know, maybe you feed off of how well you're playing in other areas with your serve?
novak, obviously, a tough match. you had a lot of chances on your serve that you kept fending off all until the last game. did you notice something different than before? it seemed like he was getting more chances than usual.
was it a mental issue today, novak, or physical?
novak, just talk about isner's serve today and how much trouble it gave you.
novak, after he beat you at indian wells last year he got into the top 10 for the first time, and i think a lot of americans hoped he would stay there and be a regular top10 guy. do you think that still should be something that he's capable of with the kind of tennis he's shown you?
novak, will this loss affect your preparations for the us open at all?
were you focusing on getting to win all the masters at all here? does it make it more disappointing than a normal masters loss?
novak, you mentioned this is both mental and physical. are there any physical concerns you have going into new york?
what's next for your schedule after cincinnati? how many days off and then...
rafael, it looked like a straightset win. you were in control in the second set and then let him back in the match. can you go over that period of the match, please.
rafa, a lot of people have compared dimitrov to federer stylewise over the years, and obviously you played federer a lot in your career. can you sort of compare differences between them that you've seen, or similarities.
who do you put into that list of other top young players with dimitrov? who do you see coming through?
rafa, were you happy with your level of aggression in this match? you've tried to be more aggressive in your matches. were you happy tonight with that?
congrats on the match today. do you have a preference of playing at night or during the day? how does that affect your routine overall in prepping for each tournament?
rafa, you've played roger so many times throughout your career. when you go into tomorrow's match, do you see it as i'm playing roger federer and you get maybe extra excited, or is it just another quarterfinal in cincinnati and you treat it the same as you treat any other opponent?
rafa, within the last couple of years i've noticed pretty much between every single point, you touch your ears and nose and shirt. every single point now pretty much. i was wondering when that started and why you've been doing that.
rafa, just asking you a little bit about marion bartoli. were you surprised to hear that she decided to retire here last night?
rafa, the us open announced they're going to put a roof over arthur ashe stadium. a couple of years ago, there was all the discussion about how the rain was dealt with. what's your reaction to maybe eventually being able to play under a roof at the us open?
andy, in these summer masters events where everything is so condensed, how advantageous is it for you to be able to take care of business quickly and get off the court?
either berdych or robredo next. your thoughts on that next potential matchup.
not sure if this has been asked or not, what was your reaction to marion bartoli's retirement, andy, and what are your memories of that night, that champions dinner when you both were celebrating your titles?
you're wimbledon champion; you're current us open champion. were you a little bit surprised to see you were scheduled for grandstand today?
you had a pretty interesting match with julien here a few years ago, the 50ball rally and whatnot. that was an epic match as well. what was he doing today that gave you some problems earlier on?
roger, you really flipped the switch really early in the second set. what made the difference after having troubles in the first set against tommy?
with respect to 3 of 12 on breakpoints, 1 today, and i think you were 2 of 10 last match. something that you've seemingly struggled with the last couple years. can you elaborate a bit on that?
on those questions, are you moving well? do you feel like you're where you want to be?
roger, was there ever a time you thought that maybe you were out of the match? you haven't been in this situation that often.
what's the dominating feeling now? is it a relief, a sense of relief, and now the tournament really starts?
roger, you struggled a little bit with your back last year when you won wimbledon. does that give you extra confidence now, as you're dealing with some of the same problems, that you were able to achieve a lot of success even despite that? it's been something you've been dealing with.
you might play rafa tomorrow. what do you think about the way he's been playing?
what do you think that you think you're lacking most in your tennis? is it match play? is it confidence? is it fitness?
roger, i know marion bartoli is a big fan of yours. what was your reaction to hearing that she retired?
roger, before, when you talked, you sounded like somebody who's looking for answers. is that true? do you feel that way? if so, have you ever been in that position before?
could you sense that tommy was getting a little tight in the second set during crunch time?
hi, novak. very, very quick match today, and some people were saying it almost seemed like a warmup for you. how did it feel from your end down on the court?
you've been playing really well since you hit the grounds here. what is it about cincinnati that feels good for you?
your next opponent is john isner. what are your thoughts on that?
would you rather have played raonic instead?
andy, cincinnati in known for not just getting you ready for the hard courts in new york, but also the heat that awaits you there. heat didn't really show up today.
you've been coming here eight years. in those eight years, tell us about those cincinnati fans, how you've enjoyed playing in front of them and enjoyed the crowds.
andy, the usta announced they're going to put a roof on the main stadium at flushing meadows. i just wonder if you had any thoughts about that idea.
do you think it's unfair to the ones who don't get to go out there? they can be left behind, and then some players will be on course, you know, like with every other day.
people have talked about how the wimbledon crowd gets rowdier under the roof or louder. what do you think a us open crowd would become amplified under a roof?
what sort of reception do you think you're going to get this time in new york? i mean, you've always got a pretty good reception, but you're going back there as a champion. has that thought occurred to you that it might be a little different this time?
i'm a little surprised that you're not more happy about the roof that the usta proposing, because you were there a couple of years ago and it played havoc with the schedule and water bubbled up on the court. you were part of the people that went and talked to the tournament. i know you like to play an outdoor tournament outdoors, but don't you think that's a pretty strong solution?
how'd you feel about the match today? did that go pretty much as you expected it to?
just wanted to follow up on that. it sounded like in your tv interview you weren't real happy with your volley. can you talk about that? was something not working right for you in that regard?
how's your body felt through training and preparation this week? and then also, do you think you'll be tuning in for the scotland versus england international friendly this afternoon?
relatively easy today?
looked like you were moving pretty good, john, in both sets. do you think that maybe surprised him a little bit?
when you were sitting in atlanta with that trophy next to you you said you hoped to not see it for over a month because you were going to be on the road. did it feel good to actually have that seven days, six days off, and you think that's going to pay off the next couple weeks at the open?
how has the weather here affected you at all?
i was just thinking because when you get to new york it can be really awful out there. is there anything about...
well, humidity and nastiness.
john, you're talking about conditions in new york, and the usta, they announced they're going to have plans for a retractible roof over ashe. just wondering what your thoughts on that were.
i don't think they've said yet.
do you think it's something the tournament needed?
john, can you talk a little bit about the bryans going into the us open. i know you know them pretty well. and how much they've achieved, it's like pretty incredible.
have you been able to take any lessons fromthem?
john, i was just wondering what your reaction was to your grandpa's homemade shirts.
have you seen it in person or just via picture?
is he coming to the us open?
could you just take us from monaco serving at 54 in the first set and the next three games.
a lot of times the players say how the conditions are different. how would you describe them? and then looking ahead to the us open, how do you think cincinnati is a good prep, or is montreal maybe a little bit better for the surface?
how concerned are you that the atp hasn't filled the ceo position yet?
yeah.
you talked about the conditions and getting used to them. how long does that usually take you in a tournament?
in the semifinal against delpotro at wimbledon, he hit some pretty massive forehands. it seemed like he was hitting them harder than he was in the past or used to in the past, or did you notice any change in the way he was hitting them?
does it feels like he hits it harder on the run maybe than anybody?
after the match, you went up to a girl kind of on the side and gave her a hug.
three girls. were they your biggest crowd support today?
you and andy and all the top guys, whenever you win a tournament, you both turn to compliment your team on the job they've done and you compliment the other guy's team, not just your opponent. obviously you weren't playing 10 or 20 years ago, but has tennis become more of a team sport? obviously, it's you out there by yourself, but to what extent has it become more important to have a group of people around you?
do you have any sense why that's changed, even in your career, since you started playing?
john, it's a pretty solid win. seems like you've been not needing tiebreaks much the last few weeks. how are you feeling on your return and just playing overall?
how do you feel just overall about your level this summer?
are you playing next week?
and the knee thing that happened at wimbledon, no recurrence of that? just a freak incident?
what are you doing differently?
as a guy with one of the bigger serves in the game, i'm wondering what you think about the essential disappearance of the classic serve and volleyer at the top of the game. i'm curious if coaches along the way have tried to convince you into doing more of it or that's just not reasonable anymore?
why do you think it's pretty much disappeared or disappearing?
what sort of sports options beyond tennis did you have growing up? why did you stay with tennis? and if you would, in your opinion, why do you think more big, athletic american guys are not taking the route that you've taken?
why do you think that more guys have not taken your route? why have more guys, in essence, played basketball or football or what have you instead of tennis?
had you grown earlier, spurted earlier, might your decision have been different?
john, obviously, it's been a pretty good month for you playing, but this being the first week of no americans in the top 20, i was wondering if you think that sort of milestone means anything?
that said, would you have ever thought that the topranked american man in the world would be 22nd?
you don't know?
many congratulations. you said to us before that nothing would probably top the us open. are you changing your mind on that at all?
at the end it looked like you didn't know whether to smile or cry. has it sunk in yet? if not, when do you think it will?
the word 'disbelief', to watch you when you got the trophy and going through the halls, you had this look on your face. can you describe the disbelief that's gone on? are you aware that you're the first brit to ever win this tournament in shorts?
it was a straightsets win, but it must feel like one of the toughest fivesetters you've ever played.
dunblane was absolutely deserted today. any message for your hometown?
is your biggest achievement making ivan smile? and what did he say to you at the end?
in terms of a daytoday thing, what difference do you think he's made to you working with you?
the moment you won you seemed not to turn to your players box. you seemed to turn to others in the crowd. we couldn't quite work out who. was it anyone in particular?
what was going through your mind in the break before the final game? a lot of thinking time to consider that you just have to serve it out and you win wimbledon.
you managed to shut out the occasion?
you've had an incredible progression in your career. could you talk about what has been the key to your growth and success?
now that you've had the release of the win, can you speak a little bit about what it's like to be the standard bearer of british tennis at wimbledon and how you've endured it through all these years, how difficult it is?
were you surprised how much novak dropshoted you today?
back to ivan. at the end of the match when you went up to the player box, i think ivan was the first person you went to. as you were going up there, were you thinking he was the one person you want to congratulate, to share it with first, or were you thinking should i go to kim, your mother?
nobody has ever heard noise like that at wimbledon before. did that surprise you? was it like the olympics? is that an indication of how people warm to you? do you think it will change things in your life?
was it more like the olympic feeling than a normal wimbledon?
i think you had a couple of glasses of champagne after the us open. are you going to have a few more glasses tonight? how are you going to celebrate?
what would you tell fred perry if he was alive now and will you start wearing his shirts?
i doubt that you knew fred perry, but i knew fred, and every year i'd come to cover wimbledon and i'd say, is this the year? he'd say, i don't think so. it went on like that for several years, and finally fred couldn't make it anymore. so he said, i won't make it, and you don't look too well yourself. anyway, he kept hoping this day would happen. i'm glad to report that it did happen.
during this cycle, where was the point you felt the most negativity and doubt? do you feel vindicated? did you always feel this was going to happen, this day?
now that you've achieved your longterm goal, have you had any thoughts about perhaps settling down, having a family, popping the question to kim?
tough question to follow. you were asked about being the standard bearer of tennis in british tennis. do you worry that in 77 years the top british player is going to be asked what andy murray would say to him or what he would say to andy murray?
what do you tell miss bartoli at the ball tonight about the francoscottish alliance at wimbledon?
it felt at times in that match that you couldn't get your game quite organized. did you feel the same way? did you also feel the semifinal took something out of you?
you hit quite a lot of dropshots in the match. what was the reasoning for that?
the match statistics had 40 unforced errors against your name. that's very unusual for you.
can you appreciate the history that just went on here, and if you were in his shoes what this must mean to him and everybody in this area?
it's hard so close after the match. when you're getting out of a match where you haven't played your best tennis, what are the reasons you see why it happened today?
did the crowd affect you at all? what was it like playing in that atmosphere?
in hindsight, was the epic performance on friday, did that take too much out of you physically?
how much of the going for dropshots and maybe the being more aggressive of the two just comes out of how similar your two games are? did you feel more pressure than usual to mix it up?
as someone who has known andy for so many years, what are your observations as to his physical and mental development that have gotten him to this point with all the pressures involved?
talk a little bit more about that, his progression from all the frustration here, last year, the olympics, us open. where do you think that mental side has given him the most strength?
what words did you exchange at the end with andy? you understand just how much this means to him.
what will you take away from this day?
it's been an incredible year for andy murray. can he top this? if it's possible, do you think he will?
how do you feel the game would have gone if you would have won that last game?
is this loss tougher to take than the us open loss?
are you the kind of player that analyzes what has gone wrong? do you go back and look over games very closely to see what went wrong or what you could have done better?
looking ahead a little bit, the hard courts are coming up in the u.s.; three different slam winners. how do you see things shaking out the summer ahead?
you said on the tele or the radio that your emotion in the moment of game, set, and match was different this year to last year. can you just expand on that a little bit.
given the fourth set you won in 35 minutes, was it the wrong call to close the roof?
you seemed pretty angry at the time when you were told.
did it help you, that sort of anger? did you use that?
what did andrew jarrett say to you?
was he apologetic at all?
my question is: what does the olympic gold medal mean to you? more confidence, less pressure, further expecting, or something else?
can you speak on jerzy's potential, what you felt from his game today, what you think of him going forward?
did you feel any difference in him today as opposed to paris?
i'm wondering if you can carry any of what happened last year here, the great run, into sunday, what you might have learned from that. also, if you could bring him back right now, what kind of a chat would you have with fred perry?
what do you think he would say to you?
did you watch any of the first semifinal?
on the previous issue of expectations, how might your expectations be different than last year going into this year's wimbledon final and your mindset?
do you feel there are a good number of similarities between your game and novak's? how do you think your game differs from his?
who will have the psychological edge? will it be you after winning here at the olympics, or will it be novak after winning at the australian open?
there is such a small age difference between you and nole. you know each other very well. how would you consider your relationship with novak? is it a friendship or has it moved on to a rivalry now?
what do you consider his main strength? is it the mental part of the game? do you consider that mental part so important?
i know there's sort of the ranking of achievements can be tiresome sometimes, but because of the weight of history, 77 years, fred perry, would winning wimbledon mean more to you than winning the us open? where do those things sit in your mind?
you won 71% of secondserve points today. the last few times you played novak, he's often won more than 50%. he's one of the best returners in the world  maybe of all time. how do you feel your second serve is working now and how important is that going to be in the match?
you won your only previous match on grass against novak. do you think this surface gives you any advantage?
djokovic has said that he keeps calm by meditating. there's a buddhist temple in wimbledon he goes to. i was wondering what do you use to try and focus, keep calm, et cetera, before the final?
despite your disappointment, do you draw confidence from the way you played out there today?
how did the break when the roof was closed affect you?
what did you say to him after?
you had a great couple of weeks here. can you go into a little more depth about it's always a process to get there and learn how to win these big matches as you get older. can you appreciate that, too?
andy murray was pretty angry about the roof being closed when it was. he said it was just because you were pressuring the umpire from 8:00 onwards. what was your view of the situation?
did you want the roof closed earlier, then?
what did you think about murray complaining about it being shut?
did you understand that he was angry about that being closed at that point in the game?
what did you do while the first semifinal was going so long? how did it affect you waiting? were you watching the match?
andy murray said during the interruption of play you looked pretty relaxed and you were speaking on the phone. can you tell us who you were speaking with? was it about the match?
how good do you think you can be in the next few years? you certainly have beaten the best players in the world and are getting better.
i noticed at one point you hit the net with your racquet. looked like you were getting quite frustrated. do you find it quite hard to contain your frustration in a match that's not going your way?
how did you cope with the wimbledon crowd and the support they were giving andy?
can you tell any difference in andy as a player since paris? is he the same or has he improved since you played?
you looked pretty much in control until 41 up in the third set. like you said, you had your game plan. what went wrong after that? was it something in your head?
if you could put your days here this year at wimbledon, express it in one word, what would that be?
how so?
have you ever had to dig deeper to get a win than that?
how do you explain you've become such a master in long, long matches like that?
as well as you know him, have you ever seen him have so much fun in a match, especially with the importance of it on the line?
can you talk about this mental side after the fourth set when you had two match points and you had to come back for the fifth.
in seven of your eight last grand slams you've played an epic, dramatic fivesetter. when you get to the fifth set, how much is mental and how much is physical?
take it a little further on the art of the epic match. how much is stroke analysis? you focus on your breathing. talk about the dynamic within yourself in these great matches.
you mentioned the interactions with juan martin. when he came onto your side of the net, what were you guys saying to each other?
what did you say to each other?
with you again reaching a major final, what are your reflections on the childhood coach you had and recently lost and what she meant to all you achieved?
do you think you have sufficient time to recover physically? what will you do tomorrow to recuperate?
when it gets to the stages it got to today, you're playing somebody you regard as a friend, how difficult does it become when you're facing him across the net?
is it a good thing at this stage of a tournament to have a real tough test like that? is it something that is useful for you psychologically?
how hard a match was that to play? looked like it was difficult because you were playing someone from your own country.
how difficult is it to try and break him and deal with his serve?
how did you find the occasion, playing in your first grand slam quarterfinal on such a big court?
you know jerzy's game better than most players on tour. does he have it in him to win wimbledon this year, do you think?
a lot of emotions at the end. you went around and swapped shirts. how did it come about that you swapped shirts? did you suggest it?
even though it obviously must be disappointing to lose, does it make it perhaps a little bit easier that it is a friend of yours that is going through to the next round?
it was pretty unusual to see you swapping shirts at the end. was it the first time you did it on a tennis court?
how would you assess your fortnight here? what are your thoughts after reaching the quarterfinals?
how does this moment rate in your life?
what does it mean to you to represent your country and make it this far?
what is the reaction in your country? what are people in poland saying and doing in response to what's going on here?
it was a very emotional match. how difficult was it to play against a friend?
what has the success and the support of your countrywoman agnieszka radwanska meant to you?
are you close with her? do you know her very well?
you were clearly very emotional on the court. you still seem a bit taken aback by everything.
what are those emotions in your heart and head as you're speaking right now and as you finish the match?
it looks like you used a lot of energy. what do you plan to do to recover quickly from the psychological point of view?
obviously at the end you swapped shirts, which was a nice touch. people don't normally see that in tennis. how did you see that from your point of view?
how do you prepare for the semifinal? you don't know who you're going to play against, but what do you think?
it looks like andy murray is going to be your opponent. he has match point right now. what would it mean to you to play against andy murray in the semifinal knowing about the country's emotions here?
how would you describe andy as a player?
any thoughts on the other semifinal, djokovic against del potro?
you talk about your emotions being so strong partly because of the struggles that you've had getting to this point. what does reaching the semifinals at wimbledon mean to you as a player going forward and an icon in poland?
i'm wondering how andy did against your serve when you played him? have you played in such an intense home atmosphere before?
have you ever asked your opponents what it's like to try to return your serve?
i saw an interview before. you said you thought your forehand was your biggest weapon. do you think your forehand is a bigger weapon than your serve?
you mentioned your previous match against andy murray when you did very well. what helped you do so well? what was the key to the match?
he won, so he's going to be your opponent. is there anything else you can share with us about what it's like to play against andy for you?
how much did his early injury timeout affect the match? looked like it might be pretty serious.
did the injury make you change the way you played, your game plan?
a question about nutrition. what do you eat during the match?
a lot of people have been talking for the last week or so, and everyone seems to have put andy and novak in the final already. is del potro playing well enough that he could cause an upset?
there were rumors on the internet saying you had to cut short your practice session because of an injury. did you play with some sort of injury today?
did you feel the pain more acutely during the match?
you will be no.3 in the next rankings. everyone has been talking about the big four for so long. how proud are you being no.3?
was the issue with you physically the ankle only or the toe as well?
you've been playing very intense tennis for a long period of time now. do you feel you've been playing so much tennis you need a rest?
where will you go to rest?
now that you will be no.3, does it change your expectations at all going into the u.s. season?
do you feel like you need to making more finals or win more tournaments?
how did you think del potro would play after he had that fall?
what did he show you by the way he played? were there any surprises in the way he played?
did he show you anything about how tough he is after that fall, to play as well as he did after?
when you come back from two breaks down against a player like berdych, what kind of confidence does it give you?
your first time at this stage of the tournament without dropping a set. is that reflective of how you feel your form is and also your confidence level?
now you'll play del potro. last time you played on grass was in the olympics. how do you expect the match to go?
you spoke a few minutes ago about how you're feeling as you're progressing through the tournament. can you compare the feeling you have now with other times in your career, or is this somehow different?
you mentioned del potro's injuries. it seems that he's carrying on at the moment. does that affect the way you go into the semifinal tactically?
what did you think of nemanja vidic coming to see you rather than taking a seat in the royal box?
how do you assess your own situation now? can you get much better?
how much out of 10, would you say?
over the tournament we've seen a lot of players slip over on the grass. you haven't so much. what do you put that down to? do you have natural balance? is it experience?
have you watched murray's side of the draw with a little bit of envy? cilic, tsonga, nadal, federer all go.
can you explain how that nemanja came? did you invite him?
do you want him back for the semifinals?
another nutrition question. what do you eat and drink during the match? is it always the same even if the match is shorter or longer?
it's your 13th semifinal in a row in grand slams. you're no.1, expected to go all the way. is there a special feeling when you reach the last four of a grand slam?
does it feel like business as usual reaching the semis?
we know your dog pierre is an important fellow.
have you brought him over?
he's here?
there were a couple of incidents in the second set, like when the umpire called a fault, which would have made it a doublefault. was that a distracting factor at all?
on the set point down, were you distracted by novak's cry when he slipped on the baseline?
could you describe specifically what's improved in novak's game since the last time you played here three years ago, when you beat him, in terms of tactics, mental game, strokes, physically?
when you had a doublebreak lead in the second set and lost the three games in a row, was that more you losing focus, or do you think he improved there?
was that the story of the match: you giving him too many chances?
do you think he's the favorite to win the tournament now?
the tiebreak in the second set was crucial?
was there any point in the match where you thought you had a real chance?
did the crowd make things difficult for you today?
how far do you think andy can go?
your record against andy wasn't good before today. did you go in today with particular plans to do anything different?
can you describe what it's like to play andy murray, what are the particular difficulties he poses?
when you're 52 up in the second, did that set turn around because of your mistakes or because of andy's good play?
do you think the performance from andy today is good enough to beat djokovic?
what will be your main memory of this wimbledon?
you seemed fairly comfortable out there today. is that fair?
you looked happy at the end when you did your little dance.
you better tell who the singer is.
now you're in el dinero because you win.
looks like you're going to be facing andy murray in the next round. he hasn't been the greatest of opponents for you.
will you treat the centre court or no.1 court to the dance if you win?
what kind of guy is gil reyes? what impact has he had on your career?
andy is close to a lot of the spanish players like feliciano lpez. are you close to andy away from the court?
can you remember the first time you played him?
further back than that when he was young?
how close were you to winning that match?
what do you think was the difference between the two of you, if you can isolate it to one or two things?
tomas was saying he was a bit disrupted by the speed of your play and that it took him a couple of sets to get into his own rhythm. was that a deliberate tactic?
what do you talk away from this week as a whole, mate, considering the few months you had leading into it?
what ways do you think you're, say, better than a year ago as a player based on your experiences here?
do you revise your rankings goals now?
what part of your game do you think you really need to work on, given your experience in the last week?
you mentioned feeling a pinch after four tough games. if you win one of these things, you'll have to play seven. can you get to that level of physical fitness? and if so, how?
were there any times tonight when you felt you had the edge in the match?
who do you think will win now?
do you feel like the way you played this week showed you probably should be ranked a little bit higher, and is that something you will focus on for the next six months?
is the seeding in new york a realistic goal given the way you played this last fortnight?
what are your plans? head back to oz or head back to the u.s.?
you are often compared to dimitrov and the other guys, raonic. do you read much into outperforming them here?
is your image important to you in terms of trying to prove anything to the australian public in terms of what you're capable of?
do you feel that you're a little bit misunderstood, that people don't understand the real you?
the coaching situation with your dad and whatnot, is that going to be something you look at and reassess, or have you accepted that's how it is now?
now that it's over, can you tell us what disguise your father was wearing at these matches here?
tough result. sorry about that. i'm working on a feature, so it's not exactly about this match. if i could just ask two or three questions in general, is that okay with you?
can i ask you one question? just talking about the difference between doubles and singles, what do you see is the main cultural and sporting differences between the two different disciplines, and how does that strike you the most? you seem to be the most qualified person to answer that.
no, the cultural difference.
but when you're in the locker room, for example, the atmosphere between the players, is it different in doubles to singles?
perhaps more friendly between the players?
tell us about the dance, the cancan at the end?
why the cancan?
you had a lot of practice with it this week.
do you do it after doubles as well?
so this is about the first time you've done it four times in a tournament.
and you don't cause yourself any injuries with it?
can you talk about the fifth set? the first two games there was a turning point. the first game of the fifth, eight dueces. do you think that was the turning point of that fifth set?
what made the difference as a singles player? obviously you come into singles, or your record in singles has been far better in the last three years than it ever was early on in your career.
so when you were younger you didn't like playing or didn't react very well to playing on the big courts, the big matches?
in terms of jerzy, obviously you finished your matches pretty much at the same time. must have been great to know he had got through as well and you're going to play each other.
do you a laugh and a joke normally when you see each other?
have you got any funny stories about him? he seems a character on court. off the court is he the same?
anything funny about him that we should know about from someone who knows him well?
what's the polish tennis scene like? are a lot of people playing as kids?
it seemed to take you a while to get to grips with jurgen's style. a little bit of a slow start today.
can you believe where you are now? a year ago you were a qualifier. you're ranked 22. must be a bit of a dream for you.
what is the scene in your country for tennis? is there a lot of youth tennis going on? how did you get into it?
who did you grow up following? anybody from your country?
how do you get on with lukasz? what sort of relationship do you have?
funny stories about him?
there's a story that you were offered qatari citizenship at one stage. is there any truth to that at all?
why not?
have you spoken to lukasz?
any banter or jokes flying around?
can you tell us how much more comfortable you feel on the grass than when the tournament started last week?
how well, if at all, do you know the radwanskas? and did seeing agnieszka make the final here make an impression on you?
what do you think of lukasz's dance routine at the end of the match? have you not seen it?
what do you think about it? have you ever thought about doing anything like that?
can you talk about how your life changed since paris last year?
about the prospects of playing andy murray in the semifinals, is that in the back of your mind?
you played him twice on grass before, and he said he wasn't really comfortable to play on this surface. what do you think was the difference today compared to the other times?
seems like you really enjoy the tennis after your comeback. do you feel that it gives you additional strength to continue your career?
you played many great players through the years. can you talk about the way djokovic is returning the serve?
what caused the 10minute delay before you got on court? is it your big toe again?
after you lost the first set, did you change your game plan at all?
your results here at wimbledon have gotten progressively better over the years. this is your second time into the quarterfinals. what do you put that down to?
having made the final at roland garros recently, does that give you more confidence coming to this match?
two rounds ago i asked you a question about the tradition of shorter players in our sport. you said it was a little too hard to answer in english.
are there times that in some ways you feel there's an advantage to be short?
is there one shorter player in the past, laver, rosewall, hewitt who...
you had some success with volleying today. could we see you serve and volley?
you seem to have volleyed more this wimbledon than we've seen before.
can you run us through the physical problems you were talking about.
and your big toe, have you still got a problem?
pain is normal?
with roger and rafa out, there's a lot of media attention on novak and andy. is it an advantage not having as much media attention?
you have a strong record against both of those players. any thoughts ahead of that match?
yes.
how do you assess tonight? looked like a good workout.
you used to play with more creativity a few years ago. you switched to a more defensive style. do you think the creativity would prevent you from being no.1?
you played more aggressive few years ago style than now.
two fabulous backhands out there tonight. a lot of great backhands in the game. arguably it's the most interesting shot of the different strokes. talk about the backhands that are out there, the advantages of the onehander and twohander.
the backhand that gives you trouble out there?
obviously when you played tomas here a few years ago, it was a semifinal, is it fair to say it was a low point in a way because you were struggling to convert matches at that point?
can you talk us through the end of the match from 53 till the end. what kind of mental battle is it?
(question about staying calm.)
athletes often say more they learn more from losing than winning. do you believe that, and if so why?
serena obviously went out today. did you pay any attention to that?
what does the next 24 hours have in store for you? are you going to do another questionandanswer session online?
in your career what were the one or two matches that you learned the most from?
was there a sense that sometimes you just can't get what you want?
would you support an idea to give winner of grand slam tournament 3,000 points?
you're obviously playing very well on the grass.
your next opponent is andy murray. can you tell us something about him and what you think of him and how you expect to play him.
will that give you a sleepless night?
how will you react to the fact that the crowd will all be for andy? you were popular today, but it will be different.
how do you compare the styles of your game, you and andy murray?
can you remind us what your record against andy is.
what is your celebration with the racquet on your head?
andy said there's an interesting story about you and your coach. can you tell us what that is?
he said it was an interesting story.
where did you meet?
it's unusual to stay together for so long.
do you hope your match with andy tomorrow will boost your profile as a player in this country?
could i ask how you found court 2, the surface? was it okay?
you're known for losing your temper in the french open where you smashed your racquet. is that still a problem for you?
do you think you have a bad temper, you lose your temper easily?
was that a good deal easier for you than you expected?
you served very well, didn't you?
he had only one break point, didn't he, beginning of the third set? he immediately got a warning. did you hear what it was for?
time, was it?
so that confirms how well you were serving, really, one break point.
after you play on monday, should you win again, there is a possibility that you may be on centre court facing andy murray  if all goes well for both of you. do you permit yourself to think that far ahead?
what does this win mean for you right now with the struggles you've had the past month? is it different?
we've heard a lot about the situation with your dad. has being here on your own given you an extra sense of maturity, you're sure you can do it on your own?
even though your father is not here and you're winning these kind of matches, there's probably no need for him to be here, is there?
what are you doing with your dad then?
to put it positively, you're suggesting he's got a more positive influence on you than we're understanding. there's your opportunity to explain that a little bit for us.
have you spoken to anyone what it would be like to play on centre court today?
you always seem to produce your best tennis at the big events. what is it about the grand slams that brings the best out of you?
did you get a chance to see your sister's match?
(question about his sister's ankle.)
did you ring dad straight after? what did he have to say?
australian sport has had a bit of schtick recently from this country. the rugby team beat the lions today. you've won your match, and it looks like sam is going to win her match. do you think it's been a good day for the aussies?
were you aware of the rugby result? did you have any interest before you took to the courts?
you were asked afterwards about the lions. the interviewer got confused about the brisbane lions. what was going through your mind at that point?
you said you called your dad right after the match. what is it like for you when you're out there, one of the biggest matches in your career, you look up and you don't have your dad there? what do you feel?
you mentioned berdych. can you describe the challenge of facing him.
did you hear the applause or some of the noise coming from court 2 with laura? did you realize what was going on when the centre court broke out into a cheer?
did it break your concentration at all?
what do you think was the key today to beat richard?
i know you take a lot of interest in other sports. do you follow the tour de france? are you aware that the australian team won the tour de france stage today and caused massive disruption?
are you following the australians in the tour de france?
i know you said there's no point asking to let your dad go back in. if you were to go deep, quarters, semis, whatever, would you try again?
is he sneaking in?
do you think he was on court today?
potentially set up a clash with novak. is that something you're working towards, given 2011, also hopman cup earlier this year?
can we have a lions prediction for next week?
this great record of yours this season, fiveset matches, 77, what do you put that down to?
do you have a particular mentality when you go into a fifth set? boris made that famous quote about it's not about the tennis, but about it's about who wants it more and about the heart.
kei just said that you looked totally different player after the first set. how did you turn things around?
how frustrating was that, to let the lead slip away?
you had a couple of timeouts for treatment for the pain on your back. how bad was the pain?
was the injury something that happened during the game or were you already feeling it before the start of the match?
how long have you had it for?
do you think you were playing in some way less than 100%? how badly was it affecting you?
would it have any impact on your schedule now? will you have to miss any time?
what will your next tournament be?
do you think you can make a big impact on the hard courts?
after losing the first set, how pleased were you that you were able to recover and win the match?
were the conditions out there tricky at all?
you were playing a guy in his 30s today. you're in your 30s. why do you think that's happening now, a lot of men and women?
monday is a highly anticipated day for fans because it's the entire fourth round, the only major that does that. we'll see a lot of different faces as a result of all the upsets. from a fan's perspective, how do you look at that situation?
where did you feel that went wrong for you?
entertaining match for the crowd. could you feel them enjoying it?
did you hear the noise coming from court 2?
it didn't unsettle you in any way?
you had four tiebreaks in the tournament. you lost them all.
why do you think?
jeremy wants to know if you can read his mind because he can't understand how you are always guessing. was that a perfect match for you?
did you ever feel sorry for jeremy at all? the ball hit the baseline, incorrectly called out, you looked like you were going to challenge it. did it cross your mind you didn't want to put him through too much pain?
has that been almost a perfect first week at wimbledon for you, not only in the way you have played but the way other results have gone?
nothing to do with you, but we've had a lot of upsets here this week. going into monday, which is a unique day in grand slams, a lot of different faces. what do you make of that?
how do you assess your game on monday with tommy?
presumably the match in miami was a little misleading?
obviously the level of play in the atp is getting better and better. how would you compare your game now to where it was when you first won here?
do you think your serve is better now?
do you prefer playing with or without the roof? yesterday andy said he preferred the roof is open.
andriy shevchenko has been watching you. do you know each other?
how did you come to know each other?
can you tell me more about the smiley faces on your bag.
you mentioned you were superfocused tonight. when you were fielding questions yesterday on social media, focus was one of the questions that one of your fans, kevin spacey, was asking you about. are you guys staying in touch at all?
just because of the support for andy murray, do you expect in the second week the wimbledon crowd will be largely against you?
you have to be happy with that one.
what is it about kevin anderson? he's never beaten you before.
did you think his serve dropped off a bit in the second set?
problem with your back, everything okay there?
you mentioned on television that you had a fleeting last couple of performances here. do you feel as though you're in a good frame of mind, your game is where you want it to be, the courts are heating up a little bit and playing into your favor?
are you surprised at how popular you've been on twitter since you joined it a few months ago?
yes.
do you feel this could encourage you to have more fun in press conferences or on court, now that people have enjoyed your personality on twitter, you can bring it more places?
what do you make of bernard tomic next?
were you that surprised at the results of federer and nadal in the first week? or given the conditions that were here, it didn't surprise you all that much?
do you think it's better for men's tennis to be less predictable like it is this tournament?
have you wished you were on the bottom half at any point?
not quite as many people here today.
today just didn't work. had lots of chances.
how has it been the last couple of days? hard to come down?
no one can ever take that away from you.
what do you think you should have done today?
when that's going on, are you recognizing it while you're out there but you can't get yourself to change?
you were trying to relive the magic of the other day?
apart from the fact you had a very fine victory, what will you take away from wimbledon this year? prize money?
have you had any messages from people that you didn't expect to hear from?
do you think you were underprepared for today's match with everything you've had to deal with the last 48 hours?
can you see how that happens?
what's it like when you're playing as well as that against a tough guy?
two sets up, were you aware of robredo's reputation for coming back and winning fivesetters?
you tweeted earlier in the day that you weren't that keen on the roof, or you missed not having the roof. does it make a big difference being under the roof?
quite useful to get a match under the roof, not like you can go out there and practice in those conditions, is it?
you've been made aware of the fact we're all getting ahead of ourselves with some of the early exits of fancied players. is there even a part of your heart that lifts when you see rafa going out, federer going out, or do you not allow yourself to think about that?
the davis cup coming up against croatia. can you share some thoughts and compare the teams between 2007 and teams this year?
serena said she would like to play you. how realistic do you think the chance of that match is?
would you try and make it happen?
you've got the weekend off now. what are your plans between now and monday?
are you happier it's worked out this way for you this year? do you prefer that?
back to davis cup in september, how much will the fact that it will be played on clay make things difficult for you and the british team?
keith was down with his guitar today. i wondered if you managed to catch up. what do you think of it?
to what extent do you think we've seen the benefit you've had of practicing extra time on grass?
share a couple words about youzhny and troicki.
congratulations.
i thought your returns were very good today. did you have a good read on his serve?
do you think it's tough for him to follow up a match like that on centre court the other night and come out to an outside court? or were you really thinking, crikey, this guy can be dangerous?
you play jerzy janowicz next. quite a tough match. he's in good form, he's hitting the ball big. what do you think of that?
i know tennis players often use the mantra, one match at a time; don't look too far ahead. can you help it? i mean, in your half you've had nadal and tsonga drop out. do you look ahead at all?
a lot of players get into their 30s and talk about their experience in the game. talk a bit about if you're an older, wiser player, how that maybe helps, and maybe give some examples.
because you've already experienced this stuff?
i'm sorry if this is a repeat, but when you're playing a guy that has just come through that kind of win, is the object to get out there and just try to demoralize him a little bit right a way?
is it a vastly different game plan when it's a guy that loves to serve and volley?
i was doing some of research on your ambidexterity.
your righthanded and lefthanded play. it was in german and my german is rubbish. is it correct that in everything else in life you use your right hand?
every other sport?
that's quite strange, because normally if you're ambidextrous you do all of the sports with the right.
could you talk about playing mixed doubles with your wife?
can you tell me the disadvantages and advantages of playing with one's wife?
not at all?
good communication is the key, yeah?
what's the injury?
the centre court crowd seemed to take to you quite warmly today. they seemed to like you.
when you saw the order of play, saw you were going to be on centre court, what did you think?
you seem to be very relaxed. you were still warming up when laura robson's match was already over. you need very little preparation or how do you approach those matches?
i think one of your serves today was measured at 140 miles an hour, which is the quickest in the tournament so far.
it's clearly a weapon even on the slower grass courts.
do you feel comfortable on grass?
there's been a lot of casualties. people don't want to look too far ahead. there's a realistic path for you to go a very long way now.
for a long time polish tennis was mostly associated to fibak, the radwanska sisters. now you're coming, kubot, doubles players a lot. do you have an explanation as to why so much is coming from polish tennis right now?
can we desperate u.s. journalists count you as the last american in the draw?
had you actually considered playing for the u.s.?
what led to the decision not to?
could you talk about the conditions out there that have troubled so many of the other players?
were they trying to get you to play before you felt it was safe?
did you know much about jimmy wang?
how would you describe the emotional, mental effect of all the injuries over the years that you've suffered?
how has that affected your appreciation to compete now as you are?
you have lpez next.
you played roberto out there today. he made it difficult for you, didn't he?
and how do you feel that you're progressing on grass?
you now face a quick turnaround before your next match. what do you do in the period in between?
you are a great hard worker. don't you think that slowing down all the surfaces, including the grass, it's unfair for the players who prefers a different variety of shots, creativity, and for the crowd who there was no real choice? most of the players just hit and run faster, are hitting harder.
what have you done to change your game on grass?
how would you assess your performance today? you seemed to struggle on your serve at times today. were there any frustrations in the way you performed?
there's so many great tall players in the game now, but there's also a tradition of shorter players. have you thought about some of the shorter players and have you learned things from them?
were you entirely happy with the state of the court?
there has been a lot of talk about the slippery courts. you fell a lot of times. do you feel was it dangerous to play out there?
you say it was the same for you and your opponent, but you were the one that was serving today, and you slipped at 30all. suddenly you had 10, 11 minutes to sit down and contemplate match points against you. that must have been tough.
one of the arguments about the people who have fallen over is a lot of them haven't had a chance to get used to grass. you played queen's and boodles. how would you compare conditions here to those ones?
given the damp conditions, what are your views of how today should have been handled if at all differently from the way they were?
how fit are you? will you play the doubles tonight?
so you're fit?
there was a bit of a row at the beginning of the week between maria sharapova and serena williams. can you imagine why serena williams might have described you as the man with a black heart?
this match, the way it worked out, might have been the kind of match, had you won it, would have been a big confidence boost for you. how disappointing is it not to get through it?
asking again about sitting there for 10 minutes. it's hard not to think about, when i come out, i've got to serve. were you thinking about the weather? were you thinking about coming out to serve?
going back to the courts, you said it's the same for both players, for everyone. a few players have come in here and suggested the courts perhaps aren't what they were in the past. is it something the players have talked amongst each other?
i'm sure you're glad when your girlfriend comes and sees you at the match. do you feel a bit more pressure when she's in the stands or not?
since you won the boy's title here, your name has been one of the names of the players that is going to potentially break through. does that actually put more pressure on you?
you signed a lot when you left the court. do you think your story resonated with this place?
do you think your story connected with people here?
you seem to have fun on court. do you play for yourself or crowd or both?
i know you played another guy from the challenger circuit today, but what have you noticed are the big differences between tennis at this level and the tennis that you play normally?
i mean the tennis against hewitt and what you've seen here.
yeah, i meant the tennis you're playing against lleyton hewitt and the tennis you see around you, guys in the top 100, top 50. do you see a big difference between their game or your game?
you have the twitter handle on your shirt. you gained about 15,000 followers this week alone. have any of the players talked to you about that?
but you think other players are going to start doing that as well?
does this experience make you focus more on singles or are you remaining more doubles? have you thought about that strategically? does it make a difference to you?
the surface on the atp tour is very slow. when you play in challengers, there are some tournaments that still have fast surfaces. is it a better chance for you to show your game?
do you think adding more money to challengers should be a priority?
i wanted to ask you about the ranking system. the players who choose to play challengers don't receive any money, any points, they just go through qualifying. do you think it's fair?
where do you play next?
today you were clinical when it mattered in securing the breakpoints in each of the three sets. how much did that please you?
your serve was very consistent all the way through. must be pleased with that.
how are you finding the way the courts are playing so far? would you put those injuries down to the grass? is it difficult to play on?
what is the talk in the locker room? in australia and the us open people moved from grass to the hard court. do you think wimbledon might go that way?
when you see federer and nadal go out so early, how do you strike a balance between this being a great opportunity for you and not letting the pressure get to you too much?
you said you would speak to the all england club and ask them if they would have a rethink about your dad. have you had that conversation? if so, what was the response?
you're playing so well. do you need him?
what do you think before the match even started, a whole group of australians singing? is that motivation? what do you think about that whole scene?
pulling out of the doubles yesterday, was that precaution? are you confident your leg's going to hold up?
did you just conclude that it would be pointless to make a formal appeal about your dad, or were there some communications?
in the next round, if he continues as it's going, it would be gasquet. can you describe that matchup.
do you allow yourself to think back a couple of years as you've started to get into a bit of a roll here?
you have a stat sheet in your hand. how much do you pay attention to that?
considering all the circumstances, could you at least understand why there's a reluctance about having your dad come on the grounds at tournaments?
you are one of the few players who uses different variety of shots  slice, serve and volley  and it's not very common now. at wimbledon, those players can do their best. what do you think players can do to change the situation with the slowing surfaces?
and how about the other surfaces? is it hard for you to play your game on clay? on hard?
how well do you feel you played today and how well did you feel you had to play?
did you feel any uncertainty on his side, maybe like when he lost his serve the first game of the second set?
how would you describe his game on grass?
did you sense anything coming into the match from him that this may be a good time to play him because he hadn't been playing that great the last couple weeks?
you have not common dutch name. i've heard that your mother is serbian.
and i spoke last year with nedovyesov. how long do you now him? is it from juniors?
can you describe the match today? pretty tough. always going to be against djokovic.
were you inspired by the upsets this week?
you were the last american standing in the men's draw. worst display as a country for you guys for quite some time. can you put your finger on why that is?
you have a couple of young women that are very good. do you think there are the guys there of that talent ready to come through?
obviously wimbledon is a biggest event for a lot of guys. i guess yours is starting in a couple weeks. you have a 32match streak to defend. what are you looking forward to in that? do you feel any pressure?
i presume that's your first time on centre court.
you're 30 years old and have been at this a long time. talk about the feelings of being out there on that hallowed ground.
what's the one special quality of that tennis court?
when you were practicing on some backcourt at your club, did you sometimes think of the big arenas, stadiums?
what is so great about djokovic?
notwithstanding the fact there is talent in the pipeline, young players coming up, how do you think we got to the stage from the agassi and sampras days to a low like this?
was that in your mind at all? were you aware of this statistic at all, of the fact that you were the last american man?
you made reference to memories you'll carry with you of being out there on that court against that guy in this tournament. is there one or two particular either shots or points that stick out the most for you right now coming off the court?
the roof made it hard to pick up the ball?
how about a nicer, more pleasant memory that you'll take away?
can you possibly compare teamtennis on the one hand, which is team, coed, rowdy, american, unconventional, versus centre court, traditional, english? can you compare the two?
you got a set the last time against this guy. what happened today?
except that he was better.
was he better than nadal was when you took the set off him at roland garros?
have you played djokovic?
have you ever played murray?
so it would be hard to say whether you think berdych can win the tournament, i guess.
next time you play him, what are you going to do differently?
that's what you did against nadal in that first set.
but you couldn't do that today?
are you and berdych about the same height or are you taller?
i'll look.
so maybe you have to bend a little more.
where is your home?
how would you describe your game today? were you scared or worried going into your game today?
now that there is no federer and no nadal, do you see yourself going to the finals?
what was your reaction yesterday when federer lost?
how does that change the psychology for everybody else when people like that lose so early in the tournament, do you think?
how do you feel physically and mentally compared to when you made the final?
you've not dropped a set, so you're obviously feeling good nick?
you were on court 2, as well, which was supposedly slippery yesterday.
are you under any pressure from yourself or from your country to do so well?
you tweeted a picture which included genie bouchard and some lyrics to the song. what was the thinking behind that? is there a blossoming romance potentially?
she tweeted you back.
i don't think she was offended at all.
in that case, if you are not a tennis player, would you want to be a musician or something?
what would you do?
rockstar?
you be a rockstar?
how do you relax apart from tennis?
can you sing something for us today?
in your next tennis match you play anderson. would you describe that matchup, please.
what has been the biggest difference for you to earn those wins?
was it your tactic to keep coming and serve and volleying as much as you could? that was like a 1980's grass court performance.
where does this match rank in terms of your career to date?
i think you're more known recently to tennis fans for whipping out your cell phone during a match, tweets about equal prize money. do you feel like you've distracted yourself from your tennis at any point and people should have expected more from your game, including yourself?
you've had a lot of other stuff.
could you tell us what did you say to each other at the net?
were you annoyed or in some way intimidated by the two shots he hit straight at you during the fourth set?
i was asking you.
what does roger federer's career mean to you and to the sport?
given all of that, how would you describe what you said and its impact on your feelings about what you accomplished today?
after the match you said something like, when you play roger federer, you play two roger federers, the player and the ego. what did you mean by that?
you feel that on the court?
at what point in the match did it occur to you that you could possibly win this?
it was that late?
have you ever volleyed that well?
federer was the seventh former no.1 to lose today. did you feel a different energy around this tournament today? it was seen as a very unusual day, even before your match.
the serveandvolley game, how would you describe its importance to you and maybe the possibility of starting a revival?
you grew up as a fan of sampras and rafter.
years from now when you're an old man, what will you tell your grandkids on what a ukrainian did on a summer day in 2013?
do you feel the grass this year is playing faster?
if you were to see these results against these top guys, nadal and federer, people would wonder what you're doing outside the top 100.
what was your level of belief going into this match today that you could accomplish something like this?
sometimes we see after incredible results...
how are you going to put this aside and focus on the next round and come out with a great performance?
how is your fitness? you have an ice pack.
it's a big day for injuries. were you aware of that?
what are the players saying?
tell us about your match today. how did that go?
you missed wimbledon last year. how happy are you to be back here and playing well?
you have a tough match coming up next. how do you rate your chances?
what is your record like against andy murray?
do you enjoy playing him?
what do you feel is very strong about your game at the moment?
what did your run at the french open do for you in terms of your confidence?
is this the best you felt on grass, the best you're playing on grass?
can you remember what made the big difference in your previous games against andy when you beat him?
las vegas 2006.
in madrid in 2009. i was just asking when you have beaten him, what have been the main factors in those matches, the main reasons you've been able to beat him in the past?
would you like to talk us through your match today. how did it go?
in the wake of the injury carnage today, how are you feeling? you're fine, aren't you?
can you see any reason there were so many people with so many injuries today?
have you ever known a day like it at a grand slam? is it sometimes difficult to keep your own concentration or...
with what's happened today, what may be happening with roger, as well, one of your biggest battles here is about handling expectation. it's cranking up. do you feel this might crank things up even earlier?
what was your experience of the court today? was it the same as any other year?
do you look at how the draw may or may not be opening up or concentrate on the next game?
having suffered with injury yourself recently, does the condition of the courts worry you at all?
victoria azarenka said on court1 was where she hurt herself. did you find it any different today?
you've played robredo four times now. what sort of challenge does he pose for you?
you said you've done a good job of keeping the level head, and it has been noticeable. that's long experience, isn't it, that you've learned how to do that?
do you think you've ever felt in better form going into the third round of a grand slam?
you said when you came off court you were being a bit tentative at the back of the court at the start of the match. what was that down to?
how impressive is it to see somebody like tommy, 470 in the world when he came back from injury last year, and now he's back in the top 30?
how does a match like this stick in your mind when you walk away from it?
do you think sometimes there's more strength and depth in the men's game than we give it credit for? you were talking about the range of challenges that are out there even when some of the top guys go out.
take us through what happened.
so the trainer wasn't able to manipulate it in any way?
bone, muscle? what did they think?
so you had a scan?
mri?
it's been tough luck two out of the three slams. remind me, australia was the right knee, right?
did you feel your foot like slip at all? a lot of people have been slipping on this grass. that wasn't it?
you landed fine?
was it like the front of your knee, sides?
how does the way the draw was going and the opportunity you had affect your emotions right now?
i think there have already been five people out of this tournament with injury. right after you darcis pulled out, and then azarenka just pulled out. do you think where this tournament lies in the calendar or the surface could make all these injuries happening at once?
what's your summer schedule like? usually a big part of the year coming up for you.
are you surprised this happened on grass? you think of this as a more forgiving surface. is that an illusion?
as you leave here, what do you think will be weighing on your mind most  the next few hours, at least?
are you planning on doing newport, atlanta, d.c.?
do you have any sense of what you were planning on doing schedulewise here to the us open?
how do you sum that up?
you said you didn't know much about him. did he shock you in a way with the way he played?
how tough is it, you're playing a guy swinging from the hip like that, to get any rhythm going?
he was serving and volleying effectively at times. showed good touch at net. difficult to pass. talk about his net game. was that the difference in the match?
a bit more broadly on sport in australia at the moment. today here, woodward said about australian sport that it seems not to know which direction it's going, the various storms over the last few weeks. now you're out of wimbledon. do you think australian sport is losing its way?
but more broadly?
so when you won that tiebreaker, what was your sense? how did you feel you were positioned in the match at that point?
you've seen a lot of tennis over the years. what does it say about the depth of the men's game today that a guy ranked 189 in the world can play like that?
because there's so few servevolleyers in the draw, is it difficult to adapt when you come against one?
what does the future look like of the young guys coming through for australia?
dustin is one of the more eccentric, recognizable characters on the tour. can you assess what you make of him as a player, as a person, how you see him going forward?
what about going forward?
you've been around for many years. from the start in your career, tennis has been a physical, demanding sport. you've had so many injuries. talk about, is it getting even more physical? all the withdrawals today. is that a problem, the sheer physicality of it?
what's the number one most physical tournament? who do you think the most fit player has been of your opponents over these years?
about the withdrawals, azarenka said the court she played on was not in good condition, more slippery. you know these courts better than anyone really. what's your feeling?
are you definitely going to be back here next year?
do you get the buzz every time you come to wimbledon?
some of the commentators were suggesting you'll go away, have a think about continuing. is that how you see it?
what were your expectations coming into the tournament?
i believe the last question of your press conference after you beat wawrinka, someone asked you how deep can you go. you said you wouldn't speculate on that. as soon as you take a guy lightly you're going to be ushered out of the tournament. you didn't do that, did you?
do you have a sense about the next couple of months, your schedule, what you're planning to play?
can you share any of those?
a pretty full schedule?
back to the slams and the difficulty. we know the french can be grinding. the australian heat. the open in new york can be wretched. in a way is wimbledon the easiest physically?
that was not the most satisfactory way to win in terms of him having to quit. give us your impression of how it was going to that point. do you feel you were getting back in the game anyway?
yes.
obviously your match was one of the seven retirements or walkovers that happened today. your match was further along. but has there been any weird atmosphere, vibe, among all the players about the carnage that's happened today, because a lot of big names are going down hurt?
yeah.
what do you think people aren't seeing?
you're talking about mental recovery. like for example, nadal playing the french seven matches in a row and winning all seven but long matches, and the twoweek turnaround you think is not enough to get ready for another grand slam event?
what's the solution then?
there has been a bunch of talk about possibly having men switch to  because of the physical nature of the game  bestofthree for slams at least maybe for the first week of slams. how would you...
no fifth set breaker, too?
when we talked in halle, you mentioned last year you felt like you should have done more with your draw at this tournament. now you're in a section of the draw that has opened up again. do you see this is as an opportunity you have to take?
when the draw opens up, does that put extra pressure on you?
you have some supporters?
any?
a lot of players  wozniacki, sharapova, after they both lost and fell several times in their losses, have been criticizing the surface. saying it's too slippery or different than other years or maybe more like it was during the olympics than wimbledon last year. just different grass. have you felt anything different out there in your two matches?
how about here to halle, any difference?
have you ever thought about winning grand slam?
this year.
you have chance?
anything else you want to say? anything else you have on your mind? you want to thank somebody?
can you just explain your emotions when you came off the court, what you were feeling.
i think your fans will be mourning the end of the amazing 36slam sequence.
is that in your mind now?
essentially 137 straight matches in these early rounds. was there something different about today? did you have a sense it was a tricky one today as the match progressed?
you played so well in your firstround win. the all england club asked you to change your footwear. i'm wondering whether that had any effect on your movement.
what is the challenge now for you to live up to the standards that you've set?
coming off court we could hear some fans saying that to them it felt like the end of an era. can you see their point of view? does it feel like that at all to you?
what were your biggest issues today on the court regarding his game and your game?
it seemed like you played better than you did against tsonga in france in that loss. how would you compare those two?
in this era of baselining, he came to the net 96 times. was that a strategy you expected? what does it say maybe about serve and volley as a future tactic?
are you surprised you couldn't figure it out and figure out a way to win?
you probably heard about the controversy regarding the condition of the courts. you slipped a couple of times. have you noticed a difference from last year, for example?
not just tonight, but looking back over the past six to eight months, how would you assess where you are right now?
a tough question, but can you in any way compare the emotions and feelings you have after dropping a tough final in a competitive situation to today where it's an earlyround shock?
when do you think you'll really be able to appreciate what you've accomplished with that streak of reaching quarterfinals at majors?
there's a lot of talk about that streak. does it free you up at all?
you talked about having an appreciation for the other players that maybe don't get as much press.
respect. what would you say to those guys who are going to get to a quarter maybe for the first time or go places where you've gone so many times before?
you hit the ball directly at him a couple times. how much of it was tactical and how much was psychological?
is there anything you might want to change in your routine or organization at this point?
can you confirm what the problem is and when it happened?
it's your right shoulder?
do you think it was adrenaline that got you through that match on monday against rafa?
must be difficult to put into words your disappointment.
could you describe how you fell.
you don't think you slipped; you think it was the diving?
do you have a diagnosis for what you have or not?
you'll obviously go home with happy memories, despite what's happened today.
can you describe monday and tuesday. did you get many greetings from your friends and family?
who will win wimbledon now?
when did you first begin to feel the pain? you felt good in the match. were you okay all through the match?
it was after the match?
what's next for you?
in the longterm?
is it the shoulder with your tattoo on it?
can you just explain a little bit about your decision to withdraw.
how long have you had the problem, would you say? a couple of weeks?
i know that injuries are a personal thing. there's been a big trend of people pulling out today. do you think it's something about the surface? is this all just a coincidence?
is tennis just too physical a game now somehow?
do you think there's something about the slipperiness of the grass that has made this particular year worse than usual?
how does this injury affect your schedule? do you see yourself being out at all because of it?
bestoffive matches are important to the nature of grand slam tennis. martina navratilova the other day said it's getting so taxing that the men might someday have to play best twooutofthree. do you think there's a chance that could ever occur?
you haven't detected any difference in this surface here at wimbledon in the last few days, have you?
that wasn't the reason why?
roger federer has been remarkably injuryfree. could you talk about that.
how did you feel at the end of queen's club?
have you had to make that decision before in any tournament?
you've never had to stop because of problems, injury?
having such a sensible hand in the half volley, have you ever been trying to paint?
how did you feel today? you were emotional. is this such a big deal for you because you've tried so long to achieve something like this?
is it right that you were in tears at the end?
why was that?
we know you traveled the challenger circuit around europe in a camper van. was that on your mind as you were shedding a few tears? tell us about that van.
you've obviously spoken about the financial sacrifices you've made. how do you think that will change after this tournament?
in terms of lifestyle, traveling around in a camper van, do you think it will change after that?
i've read and heard at one point you entertained the idea of playing here in great britain or claiming british citizenship. could you walk us through that? did the lta respond favorably to that proposal?
can you tell us a bit about your tshirt.
are you going to sell them?
you maybe have the coolest look on the tour. do you have any stories you could possibly share about your appearance and the interaction with the tennis world?
just on the british point, would you have liked to have represented britain or would you like to go forward?
would it have been different if the lta made more of an effort to persuade you?
what happened in the third and fourth sets with your health?
what was the difference between that fourth and fifth set? where did the new energy come from?
did you consider stopping?
what was the diagnosis? there was a lot of people around you. what did they give you?
the aussie fans got into it right at the start of the third set. did that give you a bit more adrenaline, raise your level?
did your dad manage to come and watch you play today?
do you think wimbledon was a bit harsh to ban him?
any chance of that changing or is that decision fixed?
there's a suggestion your dad might have been getting a ticket up at southfields. have you spoken to him? is there any truth in that?
can't shed any light?
have you spoken to him since? obviously he must be pleased that you won?
he's here?
what does having your dad courtside add to your game? what do you get from him being there?
your next opponent is james blake. could you give us a little bit of a scouting report of what you expect?
after a tough year, a tough couple of months, what does this win today mean for you?
with your father, given that other tournaments have overlooked the ban, let him sit courtside, is there any chance you would write to wimbledon, ask wimbledon specifically to see if they can relax the ban a little?
who is in your corner now that he's not there? who do you turn to with him absent?
with australia struggling in cricket at the moment, how important is it for you to fly the flag for your country?
i spoke to sam about 10 minutes ago, and he's obviously a little bit unhappy with what happened in the fourth set. he said if you're feeling dizzy you should play through it. you shouldn't be allowed a 10minute injury timeout. what do you say in response to that?
the dizziness, will you get that checked out by the doctor? what did the doctor say courtside?
were you not well this morning?
i know you're not blaming wimbledon, do you think the club have been prejudicial towards your father when nothing has been resolved?
when did that conversation take place? when did you know that?
did this happen before queen's or after queen's?
who are you going to try to talk to?
why do you think you were called into the main interview room?
you must have thought you were on the brink of your first victory in a grand slam. you got so close to it.
you seemed quite upset with the umpire at the end.
how has it been psychologically, given all the developments that happened with the tony bosch clinic and you being linked to that?
what is your connection, if any, to tony bosch and that clinic?
you said the reports have been erroneous.
what are your thoughts on the sport's testing policies?
you're currently in ongoing discussions with the tennis integrity unit?
just in terms of they've halved your suspension based on the fact that you would help them out with some information?
i thought this was an ongoing thing where you would continue to supply information.
when was the last time you supplied information about doping?
a year ago you said you'd never provide that information.
what have you learned, if anything, about the origin of the reports that you described as erroneous earlier?
have you found out anything about why those reports came out?
did you get tested by the itf after march, after the reports about the clinic came out?
you haven't had any direct contact with them?
if you could change one thing in your career, what would that be?
do you think there will always be a cloud hanging over your career?
do you feel it's fair?
what is the atmosphere in the dressing room right now? some players have come out scathingly against you, andy roddick in particular. i was under the impression you were continuing to talk with the authorities about match fixing and doping. what's the reaction to you in the dressing room?
do you speak to andy?
do you think it's unfair that you have this reputation as a whistle blower when there are a lot of people giving information?
it is a fact.
you must have been pleased with how it went today.
you had a good run here and the olympics. got to the quarterfinals. has that helped your confidence playing on grass?
you've had two fairly strong runs at the grand slams this year in australia and france. do you believe you can go further, maybe to the last eight here this year?
shuzo matsuoka was the last japanese man to do that in '95, to get to the quarterfinals here. was he an idol growing up or do you know him?
who do you know of your next opponent? argentine, i think.
do you speak to roger federer much about playing on grass? obviously his record here is remarkably good. has he given you any tips on this surface?
you needed six match points today. any nerves as they were slipping away?
what part of your game were you most pleased with today?
your backhand especially?
you became the first japanese player to win the japan open. how has that changed you popularity in japan, and has it had an effect on the sport?
clarify the reasons for retiring from the match.
you've been in bed for the last two days?
have you not been able to practice at all?
congratulations on your win. just as one of the older men still left in the competition, how have you adapted your training regime to cope with the tournaments you've entered into?
i spoke to datekrumm, and she is 42. she said it was the recovery time that is the most crucial to her. is that the same with you? the intensity may be the same, but the recovery time is more important.
few years left in the tank yet?
i suppose with your injuries it's been difficult to look too far, hasn't it?
michael stich tipped you as one the players outside of the big four that can win this. is it possible for a man over 35 to win a grand slam in this era with the players that are around?
you had two very heavy falls during that match. are you okay now?
tell us about what happened.
which ankle?
you are one of the best returners in the game. which surface is the hardest to return on and why?
were you surprised about how well he played in the second set?
after your first fall, did you lose some concentration?
when you fell, did you find the court conditions different this year than last year?
you didn't find it to be more slippery?
but nothing unusual?
have you ever fallen twice in wimbledon?
have you had tests on the ankle?
what will you do, have ice pack on it?
was that after the first fall or the second fall you had the pain in the ankle?
it's important if you play two sets under a handicap rather than the fourth set surely. you were not handicapped after the first fall? were there any difficulties after the first all?
your first competitive match since roland garros. no rustiness.
it was a pretty tricky first round because he has a special game. was it special playing well against a tough opponent?
what were your thoughts when rafa lost, about the loss and what it signified to you?
is it always a reminder to yourself and roger and andy, when you see a result like that, that you can never take anything for granted?
the key point in the game in the second set at 55 when you broke him there, that seemed to turn the game in your favor at that point, didn't it?
can you describe what it means for you to be in the zone, the feeling you have in this case?
is it rare? does it happen often?
your coach passed during all the frenzy at the french open. there you said you wanted to sustain her legacy. have you had a chance to reflect anything more about her and your relationship? also, what kind of services have there been for her?
the story is told how as a young boy you show up with the headband and the bag all packed.
in portugal, besides your tennis career, you're also known for being a benfica supporter. i don't know if you are aware there are seven serbians playing there, and matic is one of them.
they're hiring.
you have had a tough four years here, last four years, must be nice to get a win, no?
you've played enough years on grass. i know it's not your favorite surface, but a bit comfortable on it? i think you had three wins in eastbourne. i know they were in quallies, but it's a good sign coming in at least.
does your movement suffer more on grass than it does on clay? if so, why?
along the same lines, how much more stress do you feel on your legs? you have had knee problems. you saw nadal yesterday. do you feel the difference with the bending, and do you feel like the transition from clay to grass is pretty hard on your lower extremities?
what was your reaction when you learned that nadal had lost yesterday?
your contemporary, serena williams, is on a different march to history than nadal. what are your observations of her play right now and your thoughts on her place in history.
how do you put perspective on being 87th ranked now when you've been a top 5 player in the past and stuff?
the women are obviously surging now with madison and sloane and jamie, etcetera. american men are a significant step behind. no offense to jack or to ryan, but why do you think that is? is it genderrelated to american culture?
you talked about taking a longer time for men to develop. when you started, it wasn't uncommon to see a teenager win an atp tour event. we haven't had a teen win since 2008. what do you attribute that to?
training technology helped that at all?
nelson mandela is in critical condition. can you provide your reflections on his life and legacy?
must be pretty devastated. could have been there for you.
seemed pretty peeved about some the decisions with the line calls.
it was a bit strange because it's a show court, but it's got no hawkeye or anything like that. do you think that should be expanded for the rest of the courts?
do you think it's a disadvantage playing on that?
it's been a pretty miserable day for the brits, apart from andy murray. you put up a fight. you must take some positives from that.
can you sum up the general picture today for the brits?
you and he were the only two that won a set today.
you set yourself up to win your 13 break points and couldn't convert them. is that a sort of frustration as well?
will you watch andy's game on wednesday and think, that could have been me?
how do you think lu will get on against andy murray?
how do you reflect on the summer? missed opportunities at queen's; missed opportunities today. any positives?
will there be any communication between you and andy tomorrow?
any pitfalls he should watch out for?
which challenger is next?
what would you say went wrong today and what went right, if anything? what happened?
we saw you limping a little bit out there. was there an injury reason or physical reason for this loss?
what did you do after the french? how long did you have off? how long did you practice maybe on a hard court at home before you came to the grass?
how much of a blow was it for you not being able to play at halle in the context of this tournament?
how is the situation similar or different from last year when you lost here?
well, last year you said you were hurt after the loss to rosol. how is the situation now with you?
with your physical condition.
did you have any sign at practice in previous days that it was going to be a tough first round here? how big is the disappointment?
you turned a lot around your backhand to play your forehand, and also you didn't move that well. was your knee 100% today?
you talked a little bit in paris about your schedule, adjusting it. i'm wondering if you think you might need to look at that more closely. obviously you love playing on the clay, but it's a lot of matches. is that something you think going forward you need to look at more closely?
in paris you talked about your schedule, maybe adjusting it. i'm wondering if you think physically it's a lot on your body to play so much on clay, even though you love that surface.
i'm wondering if you need to look at your schedule.
to play less in the spring.
yes.
do you still feel you can come back and win this championship again?
last year after you lost to rosol we didn't see you for seven months. what should we expect this time? can we be optimistic and see you when? which tournament are you planning to come back?
when you came back over here in february, was the french open always your priority? of the three majors left, was the french your priority or was it equal with wimbledon?
even as well as darcis played, that has to be a disappointing loss. are you able to let it go right away or does it sting for a few days?
you've said that only an arrogant man would not have doubts. you've said that a couple of times now. do you have some doubts on your play on grass? and are you proud of your legacy on grass for a person who was brought up on clay?
but you're proud of your grass court play?
not today. over the years, what you have done on grass.
was that pretty much the perfect first round?
you looked quite comfortable. how is the back feeling?
have you got any other rehab tonight or tomorrow extra that you might not have had?
nothing out of the ordinary?
the win makes you the most successful british man in grand slams ever. were you aware of that?
is rafa's defeat good or bad news for you?
you've said previously that you're now relaxed with the idea that it's possible you'll never win wimbledon. realistically the expectations are even higher this year, get higher every year. is that difficult for you, knowing the weight of expectation behind you?
you said you fancied a game against james ward, another brit. how much do you know about yenhsun lu?
were you aware at any time of how rafa was going on because there were mumbles from the crowd when it came up on the screen?
you say you're surprised rafa is out. are you disappointed he's out?
can i ask you about the documentary yesterday? how did that come about? did you ever have any doubts about doing something so personal?
not talking about specifically today, but in general terms when you're trying to focus on your match, a score, for example, if you were in a quarterfinal and the other quarterfinal, which you might play the winner of might be playing on court1 at the same time, and the score comes up in the corner, how easy is it to forget about that and keep focusing on what you have to do?
i don't know if we missed it, but we've become quite familiar with your hand gestures at the end of matches. did you do it today?
are you prepared now to explain why you were doing it?
can i ask about your olympic partner, laura robson. what do you think her chances are and her chances for future years?
winning tomorrow, wimbledon, and in the years to come.
the side we see of you on court and in here is much more relaxed than you were when you started because you're older and wiser. are you different away from the court, as well, during wimbledon? is it easier away from the court?
great to see ross in the royal box.
i am doing a story about the serve, so i won't ask about the match but about your serve. is the serve your favorite shot?
with what mindset do you serve? to hit as many aces as possible? set the point up? and what's the difference between first and second serve?
and is the serve for powerful now on grass? do you see advantages with your height?
you are one of the big guys serving, but you are also a returner. who's the best server in the game for you?
yes.
last question from me. i'm from switzerland, so can you talk a little bit more about roger federer's serve? is it tough to read?
where does that win rate?
vintage performance for you out there. felt like old times. can you describe the emotions you felt.
when were you last in this form, fitness?
were you aware that nadal was out while you were playing or before you played? did that act as some sort of inspiration?
what do you know about dustin brown?
obviously beating a seed opens up the draw a little bit. what do you feel like is possible?
what's turned around for you?
what was it like? a lot of rowdy aussies in the stands today. did that help you?
when you come here, do you have to make a choice to block out memories because you've had a lot of success here, but you've also been through so much, or do you think about that stuff?
when you talk to the surgeons last year about your toe, what was the advice? did they say something was possible? did someone say you should retire?
was this the kind of match you were expecting, or do you really go into these openers with no expectations?
with nelson mandela in very serious condition, what are your thoughts on his life and legacy?
this is your sixth time out there on opening day as defending champion. does it now feel familiar, or do you have a sense of excitement and nerves? would you wish this were a longer match, to have longer on court for the first day?
obviously quite a quick match. what do you take from it?
i think you said in the past you've improved in the last 10 years.
what specifically is better about your game? what do you say is the weakest part of your game that you would want to improve?
back to mandela. no other great leader has had such an interest in sports. he said sports has a transformative quality. in your many years traveling the globe in this sport where the locker room has croatians and spaniards, japanese, so forth, can you talk about whether tennis touches people's lives, whether it is transformative in any way?
do you think the game brings fans of different cultures?
given how the discourse has been over the years with you and rafa and the other top men's players, such as djokovic and murray, pretty much calm, respectful, what are your thoughts on what took place this weekend with sharapova and serena williams and their swipes at each other?
you've been involved with politics, you're on the players council. can you imagine a situation here where players boycotted the tournament, defending champion didn't show up, making those types of sacrifices?
can you imagine the situation where you, as defending champion, would skip the tournament for whatever the issue was?
well, it happened here at wimbledon.
do you imagine that situation could happen today with today's players?
what did you think of your first experience of the all england main draw?
i know you practiced with some of the world's top players. have you ever consistently suffered power coming across the net so consistently?
there was a spell where it got away from you, but in the final set you made him serve it out, saved those match points? you could have just folded.
in terms of what you have to develop, what has the last three weeks taught you?
what is the experience like, the first morning of your first wimbledon? are there extra nerves just walking in the place? does it make you feel 10 feet tall?
a good nervous probably.
greg rusedski, has he helped you with the mental side of things, as well, with the pressure of the big stage?
greg has been saying good things about you, as well as andy and tim. how important is that to you, those words?
what are your goals for the remainder of the year in terms of ranking? have you set targets for that?
if you look at the average age for the men's tour, it seems to have gone up over the last two years. younger players are finding it harder to break in. what would you put that down to?
did you surprise yourself today?
how much of a battle towards the end was a mental battle to keep focusing on the game and not get too excited?
what are your strengths as a player and why do you think you were able to win today?
you mentioned that he did not play his best tennis. did he seem to you to be physically all right with his knee?
you were asked earlier about the mental side of this. what about the mental approach before the match? what did you do to get yourself ready and what were you thinking about this match?
were you ever thinking about rosol and what happened last year, in the middle of the match, saying, i could do it if he did it?
years from now when you're an old man, what will you tell your grandchildren about the day you beat the great rafael nadal?
before today, what was your greatest moment in tennis?
you have the dvd of that match?
did you feel you had a performance like that in you? how much were you inspired by the crowd and surroundings?
how important do you think the secondset tiebreaker was?
can you tell us what was your very first thought on friday when you saw the draw, rafa in the first round?
i understand your nickname is the shark?
can you tell us where that comes from?
why do you have the tattoo?
there's a lot of talk about who the greatest player ever is. in your mind, where does rafael nadal rank?
so how does that make you feel, knowing where his place is in history?
if someone has seen you playing today, he wouldn't understand why you are no.135. can you explain it to us? some regrets, something you should have done in the past you were unable to?
this is unquestionably the best moment in your career. what was the toughest moment or toughest time in your career?
you said you love sharks. have you been up close with sharks, swam with sharks?
would you like to?
bad luck.
have you played that well and lost very often?
are you playing some of your best tennis ever at 32? do you feel you have ever played this well consistently every week before?
you're definitely still heading to eastbourne?
have you set any targets for wimbledon in terms of how far you want to go in the tournament? you have been very consistent over the years.
you're not the only one who is playing their best tennis at 32. this question has been asked before, but what's your explanation why so many over30s are playing maybe their best tennis?
what do you think about grigor's position in his career? people have talked about him in terms of being a future grand slam winner. do you think he's there or thereabouts now?
does that generation just have to bide their time, not rush things, simply because the top 4, they are not going away any time soon?
obviously very different conditions in eastbourne with the wind and everything. what are your thoughts about making that transition?
when you've had a really tough loss like today, how do you go about getting over it?
is grass now becoming your favorite surface as you have been so successful on it?
someone who is used to playing clay, was brought up on clay...
so you're happy you have an extra week of grass next year?
well played. i don't think we have seen you as fired up as you were when you turned that around when you were in trouble in the second set. it seems this final meant an awful lot to you.
the last man who held that trophy went on to win wimbledon. do you feel that you're perhaps approaching the point at least where you're a genuine contender at that level?
a nice gesture at the end there, what chris has done, plucking you from a lowish ranking, giving you a wildcard. that was a nice touch.
how nice is it to share the moment with maria? how important has she been to your progress over the last year or so?
you have been described as a rising star for so long. do you feel this is like a comingofage, if you like?
how pleasing, the three times you have won, have all been on different surfaces?
do you think in the long term will wimbledon be your best chance of winning a grand slam given that you have won on three different surfaces but grass is probably the surface most people have the most trouble with?
you seem to have become a lot more professional in the last couple of years and really learned the trade. has having roger and maria around you, has that kind of maybe helped show you the way of how you need to be to maximize your potential?
how encouraged are you in the finals that you have played you have come back against ferrer, come back against anderson, come back against lopez, that you actually had to work very, very hard and be pushed to the end to win and you have come out to win those finals?
tricky out there? it looked very slippery.
has it been a while since you have broken a racquet?
physically how much force does it take to break a racquet like that?
it's not hard at all?
where do you think your grass court game is at the moment? how many levels up more do you feel you need to go?
i'm sure you're aware that wimbledon don't do the seedings straight off the rankings.
and the chances are that you will drop from no.3 to no.5. what are your thoughts upon that?
have you got any more games or matches or exhibitions planned?
you spent a lot of time in grigor's company this week, played doubles with him. ever since he won the juniors, people have been comparing him to roger and saying he plays very similar to roger. what do you think about grigor's game? what do you think he can achieve in this sport?
if you had to bet on one of them beating the big guy, who would it be?
a very swiss answer.
you must be delighted with that performance.
there was a point in that tiebreak, wasn't there, that was particularly important? it was quite a long rally.
you must be pleased that after that you were, i suppose, able to just get on with it?
you're playing grigor next. i think the only time you have played him was actually here a few years ago when he was still a teenager.
how do you think his game has evolved since then? will you change the way you have to play him? do you remember that match?
how do you view your week so far?
yeah, just generally.
maybe you'll make up for it tomorrow.
no, you're playing tomorrow.
you'll make up for the loss.
whatever happens tomorrow, will you be pleased with the week generally in terms of looking ahead to wimbledon?
were you watching the match last night with other spanish friends?
you can still be world champions?
is that an england shirt?
how does it feel to be in the final?
do players play with a little bit more freedom at this tournament, like ahead of wimbledon, which, you know, there is so much riding on that?
you have been identified as the next big thing for years. do you feel under any kind of pressure to make the breakthrough to legitimize that?
do stats and records mean anything to you? i ask this because if you win the final, you'll be the only player on the men's tour this year to have won on three main surfaces.
andy murray won this tournament last year. he didn't play at the french. he had a bit more time to practice on grass. do you think in a way, going out comparatively early in paris, did that help you here? did you have more time to prepare on grass?
did you take that time off just because you felt you needed to rest, or was it because you were frustrated?
how long does it normally take you to get over a loss? and the loss in paris, did it take you a bit longer than normal?
did you stay in paris that week?
when you were going on your walks, where would you go?
yeah.
there wasn't any sort of one specific moment or thing that made you realize you (indiscernible)?
well, just in terms of you saying how you got over that...
can you take that nothingtolose attitude into tomorrow and then wimbledon, as well?
maria was here obviously watching you at the start of the week. is she going to come back for the final?
how pleased are you with that victory and your form?
can it sometimes be a bigger test against someone like that who is in form and has already knocked out a couple of seeds, and then, as a result, does it make it even more...
in terms of grand slams this season, obviously you have had two very extreme results in australia and in paris. what are your sort of expectations for wimbledon?
you mentioned upsets in the first few days. do you think that happens more at wimbledon or just at every slam?
yours is one of three singlehanded backhands in the semis. yours is regarded perhaps as one of the best. how on earth did you choose to play that way when you began?
was that the last time you made such a major change to any of your strokes?
not tempted to try anything, any big changes now?
is there anything specifically you did last year that's helped you you say the little things, but...
andy murray was saying yesterday that this time last year his run here and then an extended time into preparation for wimbledon really paid big dividends. i'm guessing you're hoping that you could have something similar, the fact that you've had if you have had a run of matches and you're feeling confident, hopefully that will pay off, won't it?
you talk about the big 4. you're obviously ranked 3 in the world. we all talk about the differences between that. do you sort of look at trying to crack into those four, or is that something we just talk about and that doesn't really worry you?
i think you played with grigor in the doubles. did that give you any tips of how you might play him tactically?
you must be very pleased with how you performed after the first set.
you spoke yesterday about the benefits of experience. did that come to bear again today in terms of holding your nerve almost and waiting for the opportunity?
are there many matches when someone's hit 15 aces at you and you've won that way?
78?
who was on the other side?
do you have that kind of memory for all your matches or just the ones that stand out like that?
that must be really useful.
some players do have that kind of memory and some seem to blank.
when you're remembering it, are you seeing it, too?
does it help you plan how to win future matches? do you use it that way?
is the game a little bit like chess in that way, that you remember moves and countermoves and what to do next?
in that way, is it sometimes tougher to play the unpredictable players even if they're not at the same level?
you're playing singles and doubles here. a lot of the guys talked about moving from clay to grass, have talked about picking up some different aches and pains because of the switch of surface and having to keep low. is that something you suffer from, or does your game and your experience in doubles help you make that transition more easily?
which muscles do you actually work to prevent...
regular people commute by car or bus or train. somebody in your lifestyle, you commute by airplane every week. i'm wondering what you think is the good things about that and the bad things.
do you have any certain rituals when you get on the plane or things you bring on to make a flight more comfortable?
you like grass. your game is suited to grass. does it ever disappoint you that you haven't actually won a title even in doubles on grass yet? does it surprise you?
perfect example that a set is never over till it's over? second set?
very, very close, wasn't it? start to finish?
can you talk a little bit about your serve? did you have a strategy going into it?
radek said yesterday that he thought the grass courts even here were slowing down a bit. do you think that's the case, as well?
do you think judy murray will be disappointed you're not playing her son in the semis?
what are your thoughts about that?
quite a few of the top seeds have fallen out of the competition now. is there any specific reason for that, or does that just indicate that the level of...
you're unusual amongst spanish players in choosing the serve/volley style of game. what took you down that road in the first place? do you ever have any regrets about it?
that was must have felt good? 50 minutes?
he's a big guy, got a good serve. he had to be very dangerous.
what do you change in the shift from clay to grass? what do you change?
it must be quite a change for the body, as well. what kinds of things do you find hurt when you make the change?
any tournament you play now, there's more attention on you. but going into wimbledon is a little bit different than going into...
what factors into your decision whether to play here or halle or other weeks where you have a choice of tournaments?
what are your thoughts on that, andy?
did losing the tiebreak, did that carry over into that service game on the start of the second?
how will this affect your preparations for wimbledon? will you be looking to get some more matches in than you would otherwise or not?
is it a blessing in disguise? you'll have more time with amlie now, a little extra time than you would have had?
what is it that you want to work on?
i think rafa's losing in halle at the moment. roger won in three sets today. with what's happened to you today, does that show how next year and the extended grass court season can't come quickly enough?
this comes as a bit of surprise to all of us. how big of a blow is it to you personally today?
(question about the winning stretch on grass.)
when you say you're going to take a couple of days off, you mean absolutely not touch a racquet, not do something else? what will you do for a couple of days?
watch the world cup?
is there a grass court style that is least attractive to you as an opposition? someone who comes in a bit like radek who chips and charges, all that kind of stuff?
you didn't have any injury issues today, did you?
after you have been away for so long and back home, what things are you looking forward to doing back home, things you miss particularly when you're away on the circuit?
do you mow the lawn at home?
do you find peace and quiet pushing a lawnmower?
how is the ankle and the hip?
could you tell us what happened with the ankle?
at the time, what were you thinking?
it looked like you thought you were in a bit of trouble.
do you think there is any danger that you'll miss tomorrow?
i suppose you just have to do rest and hope that you can...
what's your thoughts on the victory? you must be delighted with it.
you said he taught you a lesson a few years back. you must be very pleased to come through this today?
that doesn't make up for today, then?
second seed obviously in the three matches that you have knocked out in the tournament. how pleased are you generally with your form?
what are your thoughts on stan?
when you weigh up your injury for tomorrow, how much do you factor in wimbledon?
when you were saying the hip is worse than the ankle, where do you feel it the most in the match? moving sideways, up and down?
was that fairly comfortable for you?
is it easy to stay quite calm when you lost the break? do you get a bit angry?
in the surface shift to grass, you have to move somewhat differently, so which muscles are hurting you most right now?
you obviously had a lot of time after the french open after the loss. what do you do after a loss?
gulbis said he went to the casino after roland garros. is that not you?
disappointed you only got five games in?
do you know what the problem was?
you didn't really get a chance to get much sense of how the grass is playing then, really? although doubles last night, as well. are you feeling pretty good after a couple of matches?
talk us through what happened after paris. not only that you didn't touch a racquet but what you thought about the game of tennis, that sort of thing.
you didn't have a pang of jealousy that you weren't able to do it yourself? you didn't sort of feel jealous that you weren't there?
what happened in australia? do you think people will have a different mentality approach if they play you?
the point is having that feeling of winning, you'd love to do it again at such a special place like wimbledon?
have you had a chance to think about why you didn't feel so comfortable at roland garros?
when people look at switzerland, people think of roger federer. would you love to achieve maybe half of what he's achieved during his career?
is he the kind of player you used to watch and think, i'd love to emulate what he's done at wimbledon and the other grand slams?
are you a friend of grass?
there has been a bit of a debate going on about the greatest coach of all time. magnus norman's name has been mentioned after obviously the success that you have achieved and he had with robin soderling. what do you think about that?
how did you see that, bernie? tough match?
that's obviously the sort of hitout you want and need at the moment?
what are the things you're working on?
what are you going to do from here?
did you ask for a wildcard at eastbourne?
obviously working your way back from your injuries. how is your confidence level at the moment?
how did you find that match?
two tiebreaks looks like it could be tight, but you're pleased with how you played?
how are you feeling on the grass?
obviously andy murray is playing now, but there is potential that he'll be the guy you face in the next round. what are your thoughts about potentially facing him?
do you think that the crowd will have any part to play in that? obviously they'd like to see...
one of the things everyone has been talking about this week is the fact that andy has appointed amlie mauresmo as his coach. what's your view on that?
is one of the important things about changing coaches looking for any kind of edge you can? is it the small things that make the big differences?
with the win today, are you happy with your form going into wimbledon?
do you feel you could be one of the underdog big surprises this year?
heroes at wimbledon, who did you used to look up to here at wimbledon?
obviously the world cup starts tomorrow. there is a lot of rivalry in the locker room at the moment?
does the quick turnaround of surfaces make that an even better performance?
how did it feel with having amlie in your player's box than having ivan before?
what kind of input is she giving you so far?
your first time back on grass since that famous moment a year ago. does it bring all the memories flooding back now with what happened?
i assume you had a lot of options to think about in terms of coaching. what made you go in amlie's direction? what did you think she could bring to your game?
assuming it becomes a longterm arrangement, can you clarify roughly how many weeks a year you would expect amlie will be traveling with you?
but would you expect it to be similar to ivan?
more?
more than ivan?
before you kind of made the final decision, did you consult with the members of your team and say to them, look, this is the kind of direction i think i'm heading, and are you comfortable or how do you feel about that?
you're being regarded as something of a trendsetter, no male players have chosen, of your quality, has ever chosen a lady to work with him. what's the excitement of having a lady in your corner other than a chap?
do you see any advantages to her being a woman?
you have been around the courts the last couple of days. what's the reaction been in the locker room?
your thoughts on that?
not a typical grass court match, somebody serving like that?
where does this leave you with your wimbledon prep? couple of weeks now for some training?
a technical question about your serves, when you go into the match do you have a kind of strategy? do you kind of stick to that game plan when it comes to serves or did you mix it up today?
(indiscernible.)
playing lefthanders on grass, is there a challenge to that as opposed to a regulation righthander?
just your thoughts on the tournament and your great successes here over so many years.
what sort of mindset will you take into wimbledon? you spoke in paris about feeling like you wanted to give trouble to the big guys on any given day.
will you be breaking records and come back next year as the 16th year?
it's amazing you have made it to so many tournaments here.
what pleased you most about that apart from winning?
how are you feeling being off the clay and on to the grass?
when you got a draw like that, haven't been here before, is that a good record here? how do you approach it? do you think, 'oh, shit'?
you said in paris after the first round you felt that win sort of freed you up. do you think it really has made a difference?
even in a nonslam?
is this a good tournament, a steppingstone into the rest of the grass season for what's to come?
can you put a target on this tournament now?
what are the key messages you have been getting from mark?
is volleying natural for you?
mark was a little more animated today?
you talk about the old school aussie way is that about imposing your personality on your game?
plenty of, like you say, sort of strong will?
can i just ask what are your thoughts on amlie mauresmo and her appointment with andy murray? is it something that  obviously it's unusual, but is that...
not at the moment.
some people suggested there shouldn't be a sort of separation. do you think it's hard to...
one of those matches where you get fleeting opportunities and it's just about making them if you get them, isn't it?
must have been difficult with him banging down serves like that?
is that the first time you've played someone like a karlovic, an isner? the first basketball player you've played?
because of the nature of the match, it probably doesn't hurt your confidence so much because you didn't think you really played, as you said?
everything okay with the knee?
feeling okay?
andy was hitting with aljaz bedene this morning. obviously his british citizenship issue is going on. what are your views on that? he's not ranked much above you.
one of the most important things about davis cup is the team spirit. your thoughts on that?
(indiscernible.)
speaking of football, are you going to fit watching the world cup around all of your tennis commitments?
how excited are you about wimbledon at the moment? how much are you looking forward to it?
you like playing on the grass. what was it like playing against someone with a massive serve?
there was a tweet that the crowd won't get behind you in the same way the french crowd gets behind monfils. did you feel like that?
did you feel pretty comfortable out there?
do you think the early exit at the french might be a blessing in disguise?
what's your approach this year going into wimbledon?
do you think that's possible?
the crowd here really seems to take to you. do you enjoy that?
you know another member of the old england club quite well. what do you see as the benefits of being a member of wimbledon, then?
do you like cucumber sandwiches?
that's what you have there when you go for tea.
the rally for bally bracelet, everyone seems to really be getting behind that cause. is it a big part of the tournament?
how important do you think this tournament is to take form into wimbledon?
andy said on sunday that come this tournament and come the grass court season there is a buzz in the locker room. everyone is maybe a bit happier again because it's been a long clay court season. is that how you feel?
what went wrong today?
you said you had trouble adjusting. the last two years you have managed pretty good here. what's the difference this time?
how do you think this will affect your preparations going into wimbledon?
obviously with andy murray winning last year, the nation is behind him again. do you think he can win again, or do you think rafa will come back strong ?
just a question i am asking all players: who was your wimbledon hero when you were growing up?
special memories?
just away from tennis for a second, you're playing with a brazilian in doubles here. come thursday, what's that going to be like when brazil plays croatia?
you started the year in sparkling form, really. how do you assess your form going into wimbledon? you went out in the third round of the french to djokovic. disappointed defeat today. how do you assess your form overall going into wimbledon?
you mentioned goran. how much of a difference does it make going into wimbledon having a man of his experience in that tournament in your corner?
what happened last year with the suspension  we're now in june  is that now a distant memory, is it a memory, or do you still think about it kind of once in a while, still have that anger or resentment towards them?
you mentioned the controversy last year with your withdrawal from wimbledon. do you feel you have something extra to prove this year? more unfinished business with the tournament?
good to get back on the record grass?
dimitrov the next round. is this the bit of surface in which you fancy yourself to beat a player like him?
you reached the semis here a couple of years ago.
what was your reaction when you heard about andy hiring amlie to be a coach?
shouldn't make much difference if it's male or female, should it?
would you do it yourself?
good answer.
someone mentioned earlier about women allowed
how much confidence did you gain? how much confidence did you get out of the french open?
how tough was the heat out there today?
are you noticing the benefits of working with darren tandy now?
is your family here?
a good way to get out of that one?
after the run you have had with the injury and the results, was that just kind of a relief today that you got the win?
why do you feel you didn't play your best today?
the line call in the third set, did that unsettle you a little bit?
a match that tough for you, did you kind of get down on yourself at all?
how many days have you actually been on the grass? in paris you were saying you were thrilled to be off the clay. how many days have you actually spent on the grass?
does it give you confidence to come through a match like this where you didn't necessarily play your best but you still won?
pretty straightforward, wasn't it?
what pleased you the most about the way you played?
how long does it normally take you to get your footwork at a high end on the grass when you're coming off the clay?
bernie was saying in paris that the french open is a tournament that he does not like at all.
bernie tomic. and that he's thrilled, thrilled that he was all over and done with it over there, that he could get on to the grass over here. has your mindset changed at all about that sort of attitude? i'm talking about yourself and going away from the clay and coming on to grass.
do you always like the french? because what he actually said was, i really like paris. i like paris and the city. but i hate the french open.
but what about yourself?
is this place closer to you in terms of enjoyment?
you won your first title in four years at the start of the year. you're close to your highest ranking in about three years. do you set yourself these landmarks, targets during the year to keep the motivation going? what are your targets for the rest of this season?
what about your history here? obviously you have got a great record here. does that sort of color how you approach it? does it add to it?
with andy announcing amlie as his coach through this grass court season, what are your thoughts on that?
it's been, by my reckoning, 11 years and 6 matches. how does it feel to finally be able to beat him?
you kissed the eastbourne sign at the end, didn't you?
you must be as sorry as anyone that it's not going to be here again this year?
your first win over richard, as well?
what do you think was the difference? what made the difference?
the two time warnings. was it a bit harsh, or does it feel a little bit...
you seemed a bit upset, particularly once the second one was issued.
even the first one, though, you paused with the wind.
will you be in good physical shape for wimbledon after such a tough week?
no aches or pains or knocks?
have you looked at the wimbledon draw?
do you enjoy wimbledon, all the trappings and the atmosphere?
what makes it so special?
you won here today, and roberto won 'shertogenbosch. it's been a good week for spain on grass?
yes. how much grass court season if at all did you play in spain when you were younger?
you have been twice watching caroline wozniacki's matches. are you good friends?
was that a tough defeat to take? it was a close match.
he was particularly difficult in the first sort of set and a half.
overall, though, can you take consolation from the week after the injury problems you have had earlier in the season?
have you looked much at the wimbledon draw? have you kind of analyzed it much?
how do you kind of feel you are going into this wimbledon compared to previous years?
are you disappointed it's the last eastbourne tournament? you have been down to eastbourne the last few times.
congratulations.
clearly the back is completely better?
your confidence must be high both in your physical wellbeing and your form.
two difficult opponents, either lopez who has won here or querrey with a big serve.
in terms of your wimbledon preparations, how do you feel about the fact that you'll be going straight into it? do you think that's a good thing?
after such a great season in 2013, how frustrating has it been for to you have to deal with all these injuries?
how much does wimbledon excite you in your current form?
the weather has been very kind to you in eastbourne.
are you still working with sergi bruguera?
how has that been going?
is he working with you more on the technical aspects of your game or...
how is the back?
what level would you say your fitness is at the moment?
are you pleased with the way the week has gone so far?
you won this tournament back in the day when it was played at nottingham twice. it's going to be the last year at eastbourne. it's going back to nottingham. do you have any thoughts on the venue here and how it compares?
do you think it's a shame that it's leaving here?
obviously the weather yesterday and today is a help both with your back and your preparations?
the wind is usually a problem here, but it seems very still.
obviously made for you in your preparations.
are you a football fan? will you be watching the world cup?
some missed opportunities for you, given that you were serving on top of him and everything else?
i'm sure you probably would have wanted more matches but it was a pretty good hitout?
what do you do between now and wimbledon? what things do you work on?
have you got enough over the last two weeks to feel like you can be a threat next week?
what is it you like most about wimbledon apart from the surface?
james, what do you think?
any reason why?
you had a long wait to play.
what happens now?
i presume you'd hoped for a good run here at eastbourne?
it's quite uncharacteristic for you, particularly on grass.
he played pretty well, didn't he?
how are you going to lift your spirits?
will you be giving yourself a day off just to clear your head?
how much does that upset your preparations for wimbledon?
anything you've got to work on specifically?
he didn't miss at all, did he? he barely missed at all? he didn't miss much.
you seemed to be quite frustrated with some of the decisions, as well, that didn't seem to go your way.
what will your preparations be now?
how is your knee feeling?
does the grass make it especially tough? because it does kind of call on different muscle sets.
wasn't?
were you looking for a run in this tournament?
sometimes the week before wimbledon people have a different approach.
what did you make of that? you certainly gave him a run for his money?
how is it going with greg?
is it possible you will have a fulltime arrangement?
you said there are a few things you're working on, perhaps changing. anything in particular?
you had your first win on the senior tour here last year. how far do you feel you have come in the last 12 months?
after your experience at wimbledon last year, how much are you looking forward to getting back out there next week and enjoying it again?
could you just tell us a little bit how you felt out there tonight. were you tired? feeling good? basically just what happened?
just in regards to the australian open buildup, your first round opponent said that you're just such a great player at home. that's where you play your best tennis is in australia. do you agree with that assessment?
just in regards to the crowd, it was pretty electric out there for you today. so many people cheering your name and trying to boost you on. is that in many ways a bit more difficult than some of the away games when the expectation isn't as high on you personally?
personally are you happy in your assessment of where you are at the moment? you've always had lofty expectations. do you sort of look back and give yourself a pat on the back about what you have achieved, or are you still hungry for more?
can i ask you your feelings when you did see the draw. a bit of a doubleedged sword. did you think, yeah, it's a good opportunity, and then a bummer too playing the no.1 seed first up?
you going to play doubles or mixed down there? thought about it?
you say you have to focus on this match and prepare the best you can. what exactly will you be doing before the match with rafa?
do you think that you can go in thinking that you have nothing to lose so that you can fire yourself up a little bit more?
you played very well this week. you also played well tonight to hang with del potro up to 3all. i know you said he had a great match, great second set. was there something else that happened at 3all? what sort of happened there?
ken rosewall came up and said a couple words to you in the chair. do you remember what he said to you?
i was going to say, i suppose it's 12 months away, but would you like to come back to sydney for a third time?
so your confidence hasn't taken any kind of hit?
i just wondered if you had any chance to talk to any other aussies about their draw. ash barty has a pretty tough assessment on her own.
four matches here. another one tomorrow. is that the perfect preparation for the australian open?
it's obviously impossible not to talk about the australian open. has rafa copped a horror draw himself?
you said yesterday you didn't mind a top see. did you think you would be sitting here 24 hours later...
look ahead to tomorrow, juan martin, one game against him. how do you play tomorrow night?
how did you go? the second set you called for the trainer. the body okay? probably a bit sore.
did you get to see any of the del potro game? i suppose you were preparing for yours, but what's the most dangerous thing about his game?
a little more on that, bernie. entirely different matchup with juan martin than the last two matches. dolgopolov mixes it up and stakhovsky does, but juan martin is a little more straightforward.
how big is it going to be for you to serve well? he's going to come with the big serves.
do you feel kind of chuffed? you've got to two finals in a row here. do you feel pretty pleased with your week?
compare your fitness last year to this year. last year you played hopman, came through here, and won it. this year you played three matches in hopman; have come through here. do you feel like you're in better shape now?
over the last couple months, is there a shot that you feel like or a part of your game that you feel like has improved more than others? if so, what is it?
is that as good a win you've had this year given your record against him?
his unorthodox ball, that's hard to play, or is there more to him that makes him difficult?
you looked like you were very pumped from the word "go." was that the occasion, or you knew how difficult he was going to be?
it seemed you were seeing the ball really well. what's the feeling like playing at the moment, your rhythm and...
the last time you beat him it was a fiveset slog, and today was quite convincing. is this kind of an indication of how far your game's gone?
do you feel your game has gotten to a point going into a grand slam you're going to be that much more confident?
do you have a preference?
talking about playing this match on your terms, is it just about focus or going for your shots and not getting caught up in what he's doing?
does it kind of feel like you're playing a mirror of yourself at times on the backhand side?
yeah.
i got to ask you about your jacket. looks like it's something for martians. did you pick this?
does this mean you're out of this world at the moment?
you spoke about playing smarter. has that developed over the time i guess, not going in and just playing your own game, but knowing what to do to beat the other person?
when you play a guy six times coming into match, are you watching tape, doing strategy sessions with your dad and new coach, or kind of on you to figure it out yourself?
looking ahead to the australian open, is the only thing you're worried about the draw? are you confident that regardless of who you play  the top 4 would be difficult  but is that in the back your mind, hoping the draw is not too difficult early?
as you said earlier, the rain delay was kind of a crucial point today. is that something that you've had issues with before, switching back on after an unexpected delay?
you cruised through your first match. were you expecting a tougher encounter today?
are you happy the way your form is? if the australian open was tomorrow, are you happy with the way things have gone?
you've made plenty of headlines in the last couple of months and there has been a lot of i guess talk about where you sit in the hearts and minds of the australian public. do you feel like the australian public is behind you?
do you think winning tournaments affects that either way?
not all australian players really thrive at home; some seem to find the expectation too big or the spotlight too big. why is it, do you think, you do thrive at home competing?
you were saying earlier that coming in as a defending champion players want to beat you. are you approaching things different being that hunted player?
you played with painted racquets today. i think in the past you played with yonex. how you play with head; is that right?
you change sponsor?
what didn't you like about the yonex racquet? was it the form of the frame?
must be a nice feeling to be in another quarterfinal?
feeling more and more confident?
conditions are almost night and day to brisbane temperaturewise. that hasn't been a problem, adjusting t that?
how much did you learn from getting to the quarterfinals last week? not talking about playing roger federer, but how much do you learn from your experience?
do you think that you have gained a lot of confidence from playing roger and having some wins in this tournament early that you can take through to maybe even your best result here?
obviously your next player beat the greatest of alltime at wimbledon.
what is your mindset going into that? i imagine you would be more comfortable playing him than roger.
is it hard not to look too far ahead? i guess you have a good opportunity. del potro is on the other side of the draw; i guess bernie possibly in the semis. is it hard not to look forward?
so having the crowd support behind you here in sydney and australia, how does that actually come out in the way it affects your play in a positive way?
beating the top 15 players and whatnot, do you feel as though you're a top20 player now even though you're not quite there yet?
you said i guess yesterday you didn't mind playing third fiddle to lleyton and bernie. i guess you strolled in here with no one recognizing you, no one setting it up. does it affect you at all? do you think, where is my attention?
perfect started to the tour year. a bit nervous at the start and then it all clicked?
i don't see that they gave permission here for john to be in the crowd. this court last year was a place you had a nice moment. nice to have him?
with the new coaching staff, how much is john still having input in the whole thing?
is there some contingency there for melbourne given that he can't go on the grounds? do you have chats with him after matches and that kind of thing? is he going to be down there supporting you in other ways?
when you came here last year you had just beaten novak in perth. can you compare how you feel like you're traveling now compared to here 12 months ago?
last year you said that by the end of the year you hoped to be in the top 10. where do you set yourself this year since that didn't eventuate last year?
do you look at last year as a disappointment given you didn't reach that goal of top 10?
no james magnussen here? no lucky charm?
obviously a very difficult occasion for you emotionally. did your back go when you played that forehand in the first game of the second set when you doubled over?
much as it's not easy to talk about, could you share with us what happened when you went off the court? presumably to have treatment.
yes.
you said you felt it go in the warmup. can you explain what you were thinking? did you think it was going to get better throughout the match?
how did you feel about the crowd reaction when you came back onto court after the medical timeout?
by the end they were shouting your name, cheering.
did you sense that he was getting particularly nervous at the stage when you began to play with a bit more rhythm? he began to miss a lot.
right up until tonight's game, has your campaign over the past two weeks been as good of tennis as you've been playing in your career?
you've had great victories here and won the championship. last year you were out and in years past there have been physical problems, then again this year. is that just a part of sport? is it a coincidence?
despite your injury, were you impressed at how stan came out and played, the game plan, serving and volleying?
you couldn't play much better out there tonight. can you agree?
how critical do you think it was to win that firstset tiebreak to get in front?
do you think he was more aggressive than usual in the first set? he was coming to the net more often.
because you have such a good record against roger, do you go on court with a very clear mind against him?
a couple days ago roger said that stefan had a couple ideas on how he should best approach you for this match. did you notice any different tactics from roger this time that you hadn't noticed before?
you served almost exclusively to his backhand. is that knowledge you require by knowing him so well, playing him so many times?
it seemed from watching that you were moving as freely as you have done for quite some time. do you feel as though your movement is exactly where you'd like it to be at the moment?
have you watched any of stan's matches this week? what do you think he's doing differently in this tournament or recently that makes him a better player, being able to beat djokovic?
you took a timeout because of the blister. you said the other day you were having trouble serving. any problems with that tonight at all?
having won 12 times in a row versus wawrinka, is it a relief that you have to play bestoffive? he has never won one set. he can win one; he can win two; but to win three is even more difficult. don't you think so?
before the match they were having some problems opening the roof. did they talk to you about that?
were you concerned if the roof was closed it would change the conditions a bit?
you have a wonderful record against federer; you've won recently on all surfaces. can you talk about success against roger.
you said on court it was emotional for you. how much does it mean to get to the final, especially when you weren't able to be here last year?
were you aware that apparently just after the start of the second set, when you were having your treatment, that roger had quite a long exchange with the umpire suggesting that you were grunting a little louder than normal and it was putting him off?
what was the most frustrating about tonight?
did you feel like you didn't play as well as you hoped or is it just that rafael played too well tonight?
how satisfied do you think you'll be overall with the fortnight, with the new racquet, stefan on your team?
you said on wednesday that stefan had some ideas on how you could try things differently against rafa. anything specifically you tried tonight that was good?
i think we heard you tonight complaining to the umpire about rafa's grunting. was it worse than normal tonight? do you find it distracting?
have you complained before?
is nadal the guy that distracts you the most?
he's had a decent record against you in the past couple years.
you just lacked that extra kick in your step tonight. after going down to someone that often, does it start denting your belief that you can beat them?
did you feel a bit slower today than the other days? was the reason because of your backhand didn't work today very well on the return maybe?
pete sampras told us earlier today that he was pretty amazed by your mindset, your freshness at this age. when he was your age or younger he felt beaten down by the grind. having said that, are you excited about this uptick and the whole the vitality of the early part of the year, does that give you a lot of juice?
what advice will you have for stan for the final?
clearly it wasn't a difference in the result of the match, but the grunting and also the serial violating of the time rule that rafa does, do you feel that umpires generally are too lenient with him? you seem to be waiting all the time.
you won 142 points and stan won 143. does it make it any harder when it's so close?
what did you feel was the difference out there tonight?
harder time than usual reading his serve?
do you feel on another day it could have been your match? do you think that way?
you used to buy watches every time you had a big result here. is this a watchworthy tournament, making semis?
what do you take, if anything, out of the match tonight?
do you remember the last time you played such a close match?
you've played stan quite a few times in the past year. do you feel he's improved every time you've played him?
grigor got very emotional when he talked about missing set point in the third set. how important for you was it to win the third set?
you've been in tough positions in your career before with injuries. today it looked like the serve was not your normal serve, then maybe the forehand to the other side. is it a problem holding the racquet?
dimitrov said he felt you stepped your level up in the fourth set. did you feel that was the case?
yes.
normally with your forehand you're very effective versus those players who have onehanded backhand, like federer. do you think that dimitrov has a way that he's able to control even your forehand, he has some special ability for that?
one of the players who really loves you is serena williams. it seemed like last year a lot of times when you won a tournament, she would win a tournament. after many years of not playing indian wells, she's in the entry list for indian wells this year. what are your thoughts on that, and do you think it would be good for the game for our greatest woman player to come into the tournament at indian wells?
it's too soon to talk about the next match, but if you play against roger or andy, can you talk about it?
your opponent mentioned he was impressed with your physicality. was there a stage in that match where you felt you were physically on top of him?
you said on court after the match that you were suffering. when you're suffering out there, can you actually enjoy the match?
deep into the match you sprinted and you hit a stab lob, then you ran back and hit a tweener, then a spectacular forehand. is that one of the better sequences you've had in a while?
was it just too good from roger in the end?
amazing resilience.
how were you physically in the fourth set?
are you pleased with the resolution that you've shown not only today but in the championships so soon after coming back?
was your back bothering you at all?
what would you have done differently?
i'm guessing you'll reflect on a good tournament, given what's happened, given the buildup.
as well as roger played in the first two sets, did you feel you were pretty close to getting that breakthrough?
you've played him going back to sort of 2008. where would you put his level at times out there tonight?
is your sense of frustration heightened by the fact you know from the way you played today that you feel as though you're almost there? is that the sense you come off the court thinking with?
going down two sets to love, did you still feel you could pull back into the match?
on court roger was saying basically the difference between his play this year and last year was he felt more freedom of movement this year. could you talk briefly about the importance of movement and quickness.
did you expect to be able to play the level you played tonight when you first came into the tournament?
with your short turnaround getting back to full strength, how tough and challenging is this quick switch to clay for davis cup now?
the women's tournament is so surprising now. do you have any thoughts on it? agnieszka radwanska is...
did you get worried when you lost the third set after all the opportunities you had or were you feeling tired, angry with yourself?
formulating the game plan is one thing, but executing it is another. are you impressed with how you've been able to execute the last couple games?
if there had been the odd subtle change in your game, it seemed you were able to turn defense into attack, reaching balls you may not have been able to reach a while ago. is that your back feeling good and the racquet as well?
how did you see the ball that you went in for? murray had a long debate with the umpire about whether the ball was up.
for him it was pretty long.
you have a new racquet, a new coach, a new level of fitness. could you talk about how they all come together? it's not a new roger federer, but is it energizing and invigorating for you.
what would you say about the allswiss final?
when you're watching stan's matches, are you just watching it quietly or do you find yourself occasionally coming out with a, c'mon?
given rafa has had a good record against you in recent years, especially in slams. do you take any comfort in the fact that he is struggling a little bit with his left hand, which means he can't serve quite as well as normal?
you said before that you're physically back. do you think you're also mentally back? tonight you had 17 breakpoints and you transformed only four. why?
after losing the third set, did you think he had the form to take you to five?
you mentioned age in a previous answer. do you think people get too obsessed with your age and they don't look at the player?
as somebody who has been an ambassador for the game for a long time and also on the player council, what do you think of the tournament not penalizing david ferrer for shoving a linesperson during his quarterfinal?
you mentioned about murray. he thought you played particularly well in the first two sets. are there one or two points you can identify in his performance that gave you the clue that he wasn't fully recovered from the back operation?
do you think you'll look back on this match as an opportunity that got away or a step forward in your progression?
you exchanged some words at the net with him. what did he say to you?
what have these two weeks done for your confidence and belief going forward?
going into that fourth set having lost the last two tiebreaks so closely, how hard was it to go into that fourth set?
rafa said after the match that you have all the qualities to become a great champion. do words like that mean something to you?
you mentioned his physicality in the fourth set. do you see that's an area of your game you still need to improve?
if you had that forehand again on the set point...
sorry. would you go the same way? were you worried about his forehand?
second set.
he's been playing very well here. what were your thoughts?
david, of course you're not happy because you lost, but how do you feel being no.3 in the world that this room is not full?
you had a time where you shoved a line judge.
how do you rate this tournament for you? are you more or less satisfied even if you lost today?
since you're 28, every year you did better. are you somehow worried that every year is more difficult?
some people say federer is getting old because he's 32. do they tell you also that you're getting old?
do you expect to get fined for touching the official, for shoving the official, a penalty?
where do you feel the difference was tonight?
what about the way the match ended? must be disappointing.
how wary were you about playing him again?
you've had epic battles on that court the last few years. what's going through your head when you're out there on that court?
because of your history in fivesetters here, did you think going into this fifth set, did you feel confident?
sometimes you were watching boris and your coach team trying to understand what was going on maybe?
will tonight influence your decision regarding the davis cup next week?
in a game where there was so little between you and stan, what do you take out of it going forward?
now is wawrinka able to win the tournament or would it be a huge surprise for you?
how do you sum up your work with boris here?
your winning streak, at some point it would have had to have ended. did you ever think about how it would end?
physically how did this compare to the last two fivesetters you played against him?
less taxing physically than here last year with him?
can you talk through your decision to serve and volley on match point.
you leave with a 25match winning streak in melbourne. how proud are you of what you've accomplished at this tournament?
did the faster conditions hurt your chances this year?
how does it feel to go through to your first semifinal here?
you've been a top10 player for a number of years now. how is it possible it took this long to win on laver?
you probably won 10 matches on hisense though.
you played so well. you exploited ferrer's weaknesses on the hard court so well. was there something you did research on before the game?
do you prepare before the matches in the way of relaxation of reading famous czech writers or you have some other way?
what happened in the third set? drop in intensity, did you feel?
maybe djokovic next. do you feel like you're playing well enough to win against him?
you've had so many accomplishments on the atp tour and in davis cup. what would it mean to you to win this tournament?
do you feel in your gut when it's all done you will be able to lift the trophy, that you can win?
you still have ljubicic behind you in a way? was he doing something for you in management?
is he still there?
are you jealous of djokovic having becker, federer having edberg, murray having lendl? you have krupa now, who is not that famous.
in your preparation for the semifinal, do you just hope that you execute as well on that day as you did today or do you tailor a game plan to your opponent, whether it's wawrinka or djokovic?
what are the one or two best things that ljubicic brought to your game?
you've been right up there in the rankings for a long time now. do you feel you're hitting the ball better than ever and are better equipped to deal with the pressure situations on rod laver?
you won two davis cups. you must be very proud of it. what is your reaction now that it seems that not many players are going to play it? federer is not going to play. nadal is not going to play. ferrer is not going to. what should be done, in your opinion, to preserve the competition as it was? are you going to play?
is your serve something you've worked on over the offseason?
what do you take away there the match today?
so there's some satisfaction?
each set took more than one hour. how difficult was it to keep your concentration against kei?
the game looked a lot closer than the scoreboard suggested. is that how it felt out there?
is that the sort of workout you wanted for the first day of the second week?
last time you played kei in french open was way easier than this time. was it the difference in surface?
if you could change the rule for the time between points, how would you change it?
maybe after really long points or if it is very hot, do you think it would be appropriate to make a little more time?
how is your hand doing?
is that one of the worst blisters you've ever had?
is that why you didn't manage to push as deep as you usually do?
you didn't bring a second pair of shoes to the court?
you make dozens of routines before each serve. why don't you do this during practice sessions?
been an unusual tournament in the way you've played three guys you've not played before. has that been one of the trickier things this week?
what's your sort of overall feeling after that one?
did you enjoy the context and artistry in that third set?
you normally leave with your racquets intact. not entirely today.
on the racquet smashers, have you ever studied the great masters, the gulbises, the baghdatises?
and you wanted it to die?
do you recall the last time you did that?
easy matches in a grand slam are always good. do you feel like you've been adequately tested in this tournament so far, facing three opponents ranked outside the top 100? your next match will be against a top10 player. do you feel you've had those good matches that you need?
do you think, now faced with a very highquality opponent, whoever it is, you're more likely to play up to that level? is it less pressure?
if it is roger, is there still something extra special about playing him?
if you do play him, will you look back at last year's semifinal?
his ranking has dropped, but is he still the same force he was a couple of years ago?
this will be the first big showdown between two of the coaches who were stars in the '80s, edberg and lendl. do you expect any different layer to that? looks like roger is coming to net a lot more.
davis cup team named tomorrow. is your plan to play doubles?
if it is jo, what do you like about playing him and what's difficult about playing him?
essentially the perfect match. do you see it the same way?
really surprised or...
you came into the net 36 or 37 times, and you won about 86% of those points. something you discussed with your coach leading up to the match?
do you think the big match tonight, another big one coming up wednesday night, do you think these are the occasions where stefan can really add something to you?
as the higherranked player is andy murray the favorite for this match?
many years ago peter lundgren said to push you to the net was like throwing you in the water with sharks. i would like to know if now you changed because of tsonga's backhand or because of the new racquet or because of edberg's influence?
the other day novak said he thought the mental aspect of the game these days was the most difficult to overcome. rafa said it was the physical. where do you stand on that? obviously earlier in your career you had a lot of emotion, and then you quickly put that away. is the mental side the more difficult to overcome?
back to tonight's match. your movement was sublime. your execution was exemplary. you even challenged well.
did you feel the energy flowing out there tonight?
your opponent tonight from france, and america had a lot of players start the tournament but none are around. would you rather have strength in the draw or one or two players that could really go deep?
a philosophical question. is it better to have strength in numbers?
correct.
you mentioned doubts about you and andy coming into this season. clearly beating tsonga like that will take away some of them. to what extent is wednesday's match for both of you to address that?
the most significant test coming up?
what does it take for anyone to beat murray, nadal, djokovic in a row?
one of the tv commentators was saying that the new racquet was helping you for certain shots, like the return. do you agree?
two rounds further than you've ever been in a grand slam. looks like rafa awaits. you could be satisfied to get this far. how do you approach it?
coming this far for the first time, how are you feeling fitnesswise? body holding up okay?
when there's so much expected of you going forward, do you have to be patient yourself?
you had a pretty tough match with nadal a few years back maybe in rotterdam. i don't know if you've played him since then. what was it like then and what do you expect?
why do you hit a onehanded backhand?
is it nice to see 7 guys, onehanders finished in the top 20 last year. you were outside that but will soon be in there.
in the third set, you began stronger. stan's coach thought you were controlling more the points. is that how you felt?
seems like you're still playing your best tennis. you must feel confident you can have a great year starting the year well.
what are some of the positives you take out of this tournament?
you came in 61 over him. in a way are you disappointed because it was so close?
you're popular in brazil. you mentioned buenos aires. are you coming back to brazil?
how difficult is it to be playing a friend, especially when the friend is novak djokovic?
you were making a lot of jokes and things on the court. did you decide if you're going to lose, you might as well have fun with it?
you showed some football tricks today. are you crazy about football like other italians?
any favorite teams?
do you go to the national team matches?
it's very hard to play against novak. it's been a great tournament for you. do you feel good about it, despite today, where your game is at?
you and novak have known each other for a long time. what was he like when you first met him and how is he different now?
his personality, what was he like as a boy?
what have you got coming up next, your next tournament?
this is your ninth straight quarterfinal at a grand slam. is it something you've almost come to expect at this point?
what were you thinking after the first set, the tiebreak? what were you thinking going into the second set?
berdych or anderson, who would you feel more comfortable with?
do you care who you play, which one?
do you believe you can win this tournament?
you seem to be looking pretty much at ease with yourself and your game.
he can be a very tricky opponent. a little bit wary of what he could do. was it a question of trying to get on top of him as quickly as you could?
did you watch ana's match?
coming into the tournament as a favorite, they've pinned you and rafa as a final, how is the pressure?
is it a testament to the sport and to your personality, you can have such a humorous exchange?
it seems like you're executing so well across the court. what will you work on most tomorrow on the practice court?
what did your coach have to say about your impersonation?
who are you going to pick tonight between wawrinka and robredo?
what do you expect if you play against him?
it's too early about facing wawrinka in two weeks in davis cup?
going back to the fognini making you laugh. you like a prank now and again.
who are the other guys on the circuit that makes you laugh off the court?
that you're so intimate with them...
that you know them so well, is it then hard to see them as a foe on the tennis court, to make that switch?
feel any different? he said that was the best you played in all the 10 times you've beaten him. do you feel the same way?
do you realize that saying you could do better with your serve sounds ridiculous when you won it 52 times in a row? you've not dropped serve all tournament. where can you improve?
having such a good record against kevin, does that give you an edge each time you play him?
czech republic has beaten spain in the davis cup final in 2012. does that lift your confidence before you're going to have a clash with david ferrer?
can you share with us elements of that plan? very different player to anderson.
you said on court it was the best you felt in the four years you made the quarterfinals here. does that have anything with the courts being faster this year?
heading into the second week, all the talk seems to be about rafa and novak. outside of them, it's about federer or tsonga. is it easy for you to fly under the radar and play more your game without the weight of expectation?
a question about davis cup. you obviously had a fantastic record as a country the last couple years, and history as well in the past. the fed cup team, as well, won the fed cup seven times. why is it, do you think, the czech republic are so successful in team competitions?
coming into the next match with ferrer, in the past you've had some tumultuous interactions with the spanish crowd. do you expect to have the crowd against you at all?
you have a great generation of players like jan kodes, lendl, tomas smid. how much of the past czech republic's players have lifted you to become a great competitor on davis cup for czech republic?
you have a knack for getting your challenges right. it seemed like you were unhappy with some of the rulings made on your serve. what was happening there?
no problems?
you lost in qualifying; now in the fourth round. how do you feel about this big change of luck, if you can put it that way?
how long before your first match did you learn that you were in the tournament?
what were you doing?
had you given up hope of getting in? were you still hoping you would get in? did you think it was unlikely?
had you spoken to philip since then? do you plan on getting him something to thank him?
back in the top 100, what does that mean to you?
you were supposed to play a challenger this week?
so what do you think is the reason for your great form?
and you might play andy murray in the next round. how would you feel about that?
so you prefer to play andy murray?
what would be your biggest regrets?
what happened at that stage in the fourth set when your serve, you went off for a while?
what went on on his side of the net?
last year you were playing earlyround matches on the outer courts probably in front of a couple dozen diehard canadian fans who made the trip across the world. this year you have people lined up outside the door desperate to get in. how does it feel, that transition?
a little more pressure?
do you think it's a sign of things to come for milos raonic in the tennis world, people lining up to get into the big arenas?
eugenie bouchard is the last standard bearer left for canada in the tournament. how do you feel she's doing?
he had a lot of consistency at holding his serve today; probably more than you did. is that you not returning as well or him having a really good day?
was that a specific part of your game plan, that when you came to the net you were going to come in almost always to his backhand side?
do you consider that to be his more vulnerable side of the pass by quite a bit? might have been like 90%.
we didn't have a chance to ask you the other night about the ankle you had taped in the previous match. is that all better?
the little embrace at the net afterwards, you two get along?
he's playing roberto bautista agut to get into the quarterfinals of the australian open. when you look on this tournament in retrospect, do you think you'll look at it as an opportunity lost given how the draw shook out?
what was going through your mind when you were down in the first set and how did you turn things around?
you're probably going to be playing rafael nadal next. what are your thoughts about that?
can you talk about how it's been going with michael chang, what influence he's been having on you in this tournament.
do you think this is your strongest australian open campaign to date?
do you think you are unstoppable in the form you performed tonight?
what are you most happy with in your game right now?
obviously the game today is really physical. do you find it more difficult to get over the mental aspects or the physical yourself?
could you talk about your next matchup.
you have played against kei on all different surfaces. on which surface do you think kei would be the toughest to play against?
how hard was it to keep fighting in that third set when you couldn't quite break his serve?
is this the best nadal you've ever seen in the last years?
you're looking pretty good, getting through these matches quickly. do you think you have enough hit out going into the second week?
you have played so many matches. does it make it harder sometimes to go out there and just do it all over again, go through the motions in the first week?
there was a story other day in a local paper about you being quite superstitious. they wrote that you are obsessed with the number 8. is that true? do you have these kind of mental...
that you always ask for eight towels?
did you have any when you first started, when you first began playing?
coming into today's match against gabashvili he was obviously going to come and try and hit you off the court. is it something you prepare for? do you do video analysis on other games prior to playing him to see what kind of game plan he's going to...
you said on court that you were joking that it was nice to wake up not feeling like an old man. can you tell us a little bit about how bad it did get with your back? how are you feeling now?
with this result you equal guillermo vilas at the third position with the most wins on the tour. what is the meaning for you?
it gets tough from here on in. is it fair to say this is the toughest draw you have seen for a long time, toughest mountain to climb?
you share same agent with juan martin del potro. is there any change in the relationship with him? are you closer with him? do you talk more often with him? how do you feel about his defeat here in the second round? are you surprised?
can you tell us what you see in dimitrov? he has also become a client of the agency. what do you see in him, his potential?
speaking of your backhand, many people feel it's one of the great strokes, one of the most beautiful strokes in tennis history. you always seem to have time, a lot of rhythm, a lot of balance. can you break it down for a minute? what are the keys to your backhand and then how do you like to use it?
finally, stefan has such a fabulous backhand. has he made any comments or helped you at all with that stroke?
coming to the fourth round match against potentially jowilfried tsonga, knowing his game so well, does it make it easier to play him?
how did you hurt your foot in the offseason?
it's broken right now?
were you bothered today by the conditions, by the heat?
are these conditions worse for a big guy, someone your size?
did you feel like he played a smart game against you taking the pace off the ball, pushing it around?
do you think that his serve was a bit unreadable for you?
sounds like you felt you were beaten before you went on the court.
like you didn't think you could win, even at the start of the match, because of not being able to practice.
did the doctors advise you that you need to stay off your foot in order for it to heal, or that it was okay to play on it and you'd be fine?
yeah, the doctor initially.
given the fact that matches were suspended yesterday, do you think that they should have played today during the heat, during the afternoon?
it was about 40 maybe when you went on.
how important is that game in the second set where you saved three set points?
did you sense, once you won the second set, that perhaps it was really there for the taking?
can you talk us through what happened when you lost your serve to make it 53 against you before giving your racquet a bit of punishment?
in the second set, do you put it down to lack of intensity from your side or loss of intensity, or did he play better?
you're known for your fitness, david. what's it been like for you playing through this heat?
are you happy with how you played in general? you had a bit of a loss of intensity in the second set.
do you feel like everything is sort of coming together in your game the way you want it to?
at the end of the game when you served for the match the first time, dropped your serve, you broke right back, was that good for you to be tested at the end?
it was cool. but would you rather the roof be open for your matches?
you have great fans here in australia. i wonder if it frustrates you sometimes that that's not the case everywhere despite the effort you put into engaging your fans?
many young australian players coming from serbian communities, you are a huge role model for them. is there a message, advice you can give them?
your next opponent, you mentioned you've been friends for a long time. does that change anything about the way you go into the match?
how focused have you been this week on trying to get through your matches quickly and conserve energy for the second week?
we used to say that wimbledon was roger's living room. is that the same for you here?
were you surprised by del potro's elimination yesterday?
do you think the mental aspect of the game these days is more difficult than the physical to get over?
what did you think of his game and the atmosphere out there today?
how pleased are you with your own form? not a set dropped yet. are you happy with where your game is?
do you think the roof should have been closed all day today because of the heat?
you didn't think about it?
the shirt you were wearing today, a fashion statement?
it's a little more adventurous, stronger statement than when you first started. basically solid colors, nothing too exciting. this is a bit of a change.
it's going to stay blue and white stripes for the moment for here?
what about for wimbledon?
do you enjoy being the one guy from h& m instead of five like nike guys in the top 10?
what did you think when you looked at the draw, your half of the draw?
when you see roger and rafa and andy and tsonga are not playing the same day as you, you have an idea.
what have you been getting up to on your days off?
any plans for when the weather gets a bit cooler?
must have felt pretty good.
what did you think when you were down in the fifth set?
in 2010 you lost to rogervasselin at roland garros. do you feel it's a revenge?
how many two sets to love down comebacks do you have left in you this tournament?
how was the heat for you?
your next opponent is tomas berdych. how do you feel about that?
how afraid were you to play wawrinka?
what's the prognosis for the back? for example, for davis cup, going forward, what the effects may be?
that's a significantly different prognosis than you were hearing last night on the court from the physio. am i right?
what would you say the percentage is for davis cup? it's coming up quickly.
it was extremely hot out there today. how did you cope with the heat?
what was the important thing to win in three sets? he came back very strongly in the third set.
how are you feeling in general? confident now?
did it feel like you were playing a player ranked 570 in the world out there today?
were you impressed by him, 17 years old?
did you prepare yourself to be on the court with the roof open in terms of physically getting yourself ready for the match, and would that have changed earlier if you had known you were going to be playing under the roof?
pretty regulation game today. are you happy with the amount of game time you've registered coming into the third round?
with your opponent today, you identified a couple of his strengths. would you see over three sets anything he could be working on to improve his game at this stage?
last year at this time what were you doing and how much did you follow the australian open? what times of the day did you follow it?
last friday your opponent had the chance to do something that few of us in this room do. he asked you one question after another oneonone at the babolat event. you said he had a good future in tennis. talk about his future in journalism.
can you remember the biggest match you had when you were a 17yearold?
despite the rankings difference, it's always going to be tough playing someone at their home grand slam. did you feel the support for you out there?
that was a remarkable run of points in the third set there.
how did that come about? he was so close to taking the set. you just seemed to come alive.
how tricky is it when you don't really know what to expect?
did you notice him raising his arms up in the air trying to get the crowd going? does that motivate you as well?
you have this amazing record against lefthanded players. can you attribute that to something? maybe playing your brother?
at what point in the streak of 23 roughly did you start to realize something kind of cool was happening there?
you didn't realize you had gotten up and sat down twice without losing a point?
when you got to that final game, did it almost motivate you to make it a love game?
were you surprised when you went on court? the humidity went up just before the match started.
have you seen jamie?
pretty scary thing to happen.
has that happened to you much?
having body cramps.
a couple matches in, how would you assess your game, fitness, and recovery as well?
that's what, three and a half hours for both matches? through to the third round. that's got to be the best you can hope for.
what about lpez next. seven wins and no defeats against him; is that right?
on your days off, do you try to do very little?
how do you feel about how the tournament has handled the heat?
can you see a case for putting the aussie open further back in the calendar?
yes.
slightly. a little bit.
what happened there in the fourth set?
how hard is it the way it finished?
you played two fiveset matches. it happened both times. what do you think of that?
what can you do differently?
do you think your shoulder injury might have contributed?
what have you been told since you came out? what's the feedback from your coach?
tell us about being out there in front of that crowd, a soccerlike crowd.
you seemed to enjoy interacting with the crowd.
where to from here, beyond davis cup?
do you see yourself as a big contender if bernie doesn't come up?
you do a thing before you serve the ball. is that to show how much you love basketball?
you've reached 10,020 followers tonight.
how was your morning this morning and afternoon before the match started? how did you prepare and feel?
nerves?
what was it like in the first set?
did you learn a lot tonight?
that might be a good thing to say you're only 17 and you're only going to get bigger and stronger.
he said that if you continue to improve all parts of your game, you have what it takes to become one of the great players. that must be nice hearing that from the world no.1.
with a packed rod laver arena, did you have to change your temperament and be careful with the emotions?
anyone giving you any advice beforehand besides your personal team regarding taking rafa on?
you played lleyton hewitt, rafael nadal within a couple weeks of each other. what an amazing experience.
do you have a particular idol that you look up to on tour, someone in the australian camp?
both you and nick have been in the spotlight the last couple days. how have you found it?
some may say that ash barty taking on serena williams and yourself nadal, it could be detrimental to your development to a certain degree. you wouldn't think that way?
what are your plans for the year? where are you going to go and play?
which one is that?
are you more comfortable now answering questions in here?
one of the most dominant performances we've seen from you this year. how do you feel?
how did you find it playing on hisense?
under the roof you felt comfortable?
lots of talk about the heat policy. do you think they got it right today?
you seem in an attacking state of mind. is that something you discussed with your team? are you trying to be a bit more aggressive heading forward in the tournament?
what's the best part of being roger federer? what do you enjoy in your life now?
maria sharapova was concerned earlier today that players weren't being told what the heat policy actually entailed prior to the tournament. do you know what it does entail? are you confused by it at all?
so you weren't told prior to the tournament?
andy murray said when he first started working with ivan lendl he wanted to impress him. i know that stefan was your hero. is there any of that for you?
coming in behind your serve, is that something you're hoping stefan can bring to your game?
a lot of guys on the tour are getting more physical, bigger. is it getting harder to keep up with that these days?
andy murray was asked a fun question the other day. if there was an imaginary tournament of the player with the legendary coach, he thought that he and lendl would win. hewitt said that he and patrick would win. how do you think you and stefan would step up?
you moved very well.
are you happy with your fitness level, how you played today?
what did you make of that?
when you say 'tricked'...
there was criticism from the tv saying you needed to have more of a killer instinct and your ability to close out sets and matches. how do you respond to those comments?
fourth game of the fourth set, you saved one breakpoint. the first serve was called a fault. tell us about what happened from there.
yes.
if you're playing an opponent who is injured, do you subconsciously go a bit easy on them?
do you finish the summer in a better position than when you started it?
where to from here?
he said he might have pulled out in the third set, but then obviously went on to win it. he took some painkillers. they kicked in. do you think you'll look back at this as a missed opportunity?
despite the result, you must take a lot of positives.
did you find the atmosphere different to court1 to center court?
how is the ankle from that turn?
what about the conditions? glad to get these matches out of the way as quickly as possible given the heat?
how does your body cope with the heat personally?
can you describe at all the difference in feeling between how you were five years ago against roddick and how you are now, what the difference is?
what is the best part of being novak djokovic?
you seemed to roll over on your foot early in the match. what was that all about?
when you broke through as a young player in serbia, things changed an awful lot for you. what do you think the emotions of young damir dzumhur, representing bosnia, won two rounds, crowd going nuts, people playing accordions on the side of the court, crazy atmosphere, what do you think that must be like for him?
some players seem very happy about having an ice bath after the match. is that your routine also?
wojtek, is he still in your team?
so his mission is accomplished?
what did he add to your team, your play?
so for now your team squad is closed, no change?
what was more frustrating, having to pull out because of the recurrence of the injury, or some of the reaction from the crowd as you were walking out?
is this a recurrence of an injury or something new?
when did you first notice it tonight? as soon as you went out onto court? a particular stage of the first set?
is that why it was so disappointing, because you were playing well against the world no.1?
you're not sure if it's your groin on your quad or hip flexor yet?
what was the advice when you went off the court? did they seem to think it could have been the end there?
you seem frustrated more than anything. you were playing really well; a great opportunity for your career. hard playing rafa on one leg.
what did rafa have to say after the game?
you got concerns you might miss the davis cup, or are you hopeful you'll be right by then?
scan tomorrow?
can you talk through your decision whether to play today or not play today given your injury from kooyong.
were you able to play painfree?
down 21 in the sets, did you think about retiring?
did you ever consider the weather conditions as well?
so the conditions helped you?
tough conditions. toughest maybe you ever played in? hottest?
how conscious were you that you led throughout the match, you had early breaks in the third or fourth, then a break in the fifth. deep in the fifth, 4all, hewitt is 30all. he was finally up in the score. how were you feeling at that stage?
so that bit of luck, was that the ace on match point?
how was it today?
was there any point in the match where you had some problems with the heat? because you played five sets, threeandahalf hours, i think, 3:40.
how does it feel to be back in australia after missing out last year?
having that extended time off, did that help you fall in love with tennis again?
obviously that's not the way you'd like to win today. do you feel the tennis was at a very high level out there tonight?
there's been a recent trend to get legends to coach the top players. no other coach has coached a player to more slam wins than toni. what has it been like working with just one coach over the years? do you think that is a strength in your game?
these players say they got the legends to coach them because they've had such great experience in the big matches. what has been toni's approach in the finals of all these tournaments? what sort of things does he tell you?
because of the short match today, what sort of preparation will you have now for your next match? a hard training session tomorrow to make up for tonight?
do you know your next opponent, the aussie kid?
so 12. how much does that play on your mind?
how difficult did the conditions make it?
what was the situation, the time violation point in the third set? what happened?
the commentators were saying that they thought you were talking to her about trying to get the crowd to stop calling you mad dog. is that what was going on?
but you did other times?
can you judge how much water you were drinking?
you were signaling something towards the end.
have you spoken to him about it since?
will you?
and you need more from him from the side of the court?
disappointed in the lack of support he gave you?
did you allow yourself to get too distracted about all sorts of things today?
why does that get to you so much?
towards the end you were complaining about someone in the crowd calling the ball out.
did it feel like you were playing overseas?
i know it's a bit raw right now, but tough conditions and draw. you fought so hard. you must feel you're getting closer to that grand slam first win.
you still had a chance to win right to the end. the breakpoints you saved, et cetera.
who was the surface? did it feel different because it was heated?
through to the second round. you must be extremely happy.
how does it compare to france?
how much of an issue was the shoulder today?
getting treatment in the fourth set was just precautionary?
no major issue there?
first time in your career going into the second round of this slam. mentally how do you approach it?
you outhit becker by 71 winners to 38 today. was that the plan from the start?
you seemed really pumped up the last game of the fourth set. really going for it then?
how much do you take out of twice fighting back after being down a break?
i think it's still 41 degrees outside. how do you deal with the heat?
what is it like being part of this australian tennis revival?
what have you learned from bernie's journey the last couple years?
pretty excited with the win?
good to have both you and nick through.
how did you get through that match? you were cramping horribly the last set.
you've had some kind of physical ailments, haven't you? growth spurts, i presume. can you take us through those, how they've affected your progress.
what have you done in the last hour or so to recover?
obviously have a remarkable match in prospect. how do you view playing a player of that quality, almost certainly on rod laver?
he said you practiced with him last week, nadal.
how much did you learn about grand slam tennis and to push through the pain barrier to win these matches?
that last game you won, one of those most emphatic games you played for the whole match?
is there a healthy rivalry between you and nick as well? it can only be to the benefit of both of you if you're both pushing each other.
did you see him in the stands watching you?
yeah.
did you feel nervous before you went out?
even though you're still growing up, who is your favorite player? was nadal your favorite or federer?
how exciting is it to be there and answer questions?
one day you'll be fed up with this.
just how tough were the conditions out there today?
how important is it in conditions like that to monitor what your opponent is doing and how his body language is? how did you find his body language in the fifth set?
you must be happy with your fitness to be able to sustain it for 4 hours and 18 minutes?
where does this rank in terms of your tough losses?
what turned it around in that third set after being two sets down?
you're out there on the court, the match is on your racquet, but the fanatics are up in the stands chanting. do you hear them? does that boost you?
do you actually hear their chants?
you're down to play doubles on hisense tomorrow.
still going ahead with it?
have you talked to pat about it?
at this stage you'll play?
if you and patrick teamed up with the other players and the legends that they're associated with, like murray and lendl, roger and edberg, djokovic and becker, how do you think that would come out?
yeah.
tonight you equaled the record for the most fiveset matches in the open era. equaled andre agassi with 41. must get sick of putting your body through constant grueling, fiveset matches.
much obviously today has been made of the conditions. how would you describe them and how it affected your play, if any, today?
you spoke before the tournament about how hard you trained in the offseason. does that help you if the weather stays like this to cope well?
were you surprised at how well your opponent played today?
you're always quoted figures about records and what have, but 57 consecutive slams. they seem to mount up, don't they? and here you are again looking as fit as ever.
another record which i think you have is that you've won the atp edberg award for sportsmanship i believe more than anyone. what does that award mean to you, and how cool is it having that guy as your coach now?
you never seem to be a guy who looks at his coach that much. is that going to change that much with stefan?
between now and your next match with stefan edberg, do you sit and have a long chat with him? what sort of things...
from your perspective, should the roof be closed on rod laver when the heat gets this bad?
with the game plan your opponent enforced, obviously something a lot of people have watched about you, going high on the backhand. is it something you have worked on?
his game plan. he hit your...
yeah. he hit your high backhand quite often.
earlier you were saying that sometimes when you looked up at important people, celebrities, you felt
you sort of felt a kind of pressure on yourself to perform. i mean, so many people have seen you, royals, fashion editors, tiger, other sports personalities. was there a person you looked up to when you looked up you felt a particular pressure to perform?
how do you feel setting out for a new grand slam campaign this year?
are you pleased with how you played today?
obviously not the result you wanted, but are you happy with your effort and the experience of playing roger?
the scoreline, you pushed one of the best players in the world to 64, 64. are you happy with your game?
what have you got coming up next?
you seem to be getting closer to winning your first grand slam match. do you think you're getting closer now?
are you confident it will happen soon, that you can win your first match at a grand slam?
do you think the level chinese men in general is going up?
how are you feeling after that?
do you see the positives in it?
first two sets, is that as well as you've played?
looked like a pretty aggressive atmosphere out there.
he seemed to be taking it to you as well emotionally. what did you make of that?
do you look back and pinch yourself? you were unranked at this time last year.
burnie and west lakes next?
going to be hard going back to that level?
at 45 in the third set, if you had to go back, what would you do differently?
you obviously have played some top 20 guys. what have you learned about their physical and mental strength that's different than at the challenger level?
how important was kooyong for you and then to come here and play?
the next challenge, defending points, how are you going to prepare for that?
must be an honor to play in a grand slam in your country?
how does it work out there?
you could tell that you had control up until the third set, right?
in that third set, did you feel his level picking up a bit? given your big week at kooyong, did you feel yourself dropping off a little bit?
is the short angle one of your shots?
how did you find the pace of the court today?
what about the weather, the heat? the conditions?
do you like the very hot weather to play in?
can you tell us why you left your coach after such a long time? and something about your new coach.
and about your new coach?
you said last week was one of your worst matches of your career when you lost in the semifinal. were you pleased with how you responded and came back?
looked like you wanted to get it over pretty quickly. you raced out to a pretty good lead. can you tell us what happened after that? you started about 5love, i think.
with the draw the way it's fallen, looks like a good opportunity for you to go deep again.
a lot of the media aren't really giving you a chance in melbourne. does it take the pressure off moving forward?
you jumped out of the blocks pretty quickly. but three and four, what happened there?
what was the mindset at 2all in the fifth set?
can you tell us a bit more about the crowd.
you started to use them a little bit in the fifth set as well.
can you talk about what lleyton told you?
feel like a weight has been lifted off your shoulders?
two sets all, hard not to think about the past with having them slip?
what did you draw on physically and mentally in the fifth set?
you seemed to get a little annoyed at the crowd at times.
no, he was.
because of the interrupted preparation, not that you wish it, but the fivesetter probably wasn't a bad one to have today.
how has the ankle pulled up?
did casey's win give you a boost?
a lot of australian men playing tomorrow. james duckworth playing roger. tell us what you know about james, how he'll handle that.
day.
did it feel very different having boris in the box with you tonight?
you speak some german. i take it you speak english with him?
you had it before you went to pilic's academy?
i know it's early days with boris, but do you expect to get enough benefits in this tournament or are you thinking it will come later on?
how important is it to be focused in the tiebreaker, not let him in?
are you playing with the same racquet that you played with last year?
after the second set you changed the tshirt.
serbian orthodox new year today. are you going to celebrate tonight?
what's been the one most important thing that boris has said to you that has struck you in your time together with him?
at this point can you say whether it's more about strokes or...
is he different as a person or a character than you expected?
what do you think about your next rival?
when athletes get to a certain level, sometimes they don't like to change things much. are you someone who fears no change more than change?
i don't mean just boris. change of racquet...
will you be speaking to marian during the fortnight?
you probably have more women fans around the world.
when did you find out that roger wasn't going to be playing? how did that all work?
it's not the same situation, but many times you had davis cup, us open. it's too much, you need more rest, but it's impossible. how can you solve this?
can you talk us through how the exhibition with andy came about. were you asked to do it? did you know right away you were playing andy? how did you feel about doing it?
it may not have mattered with roger, but is there any sense to the idea of maybe putting the semis in one session, not having that long gap, having one finish much later than the earlier one, in terms of fairness going forward?
there were a lot of lopsided matches through the tournament. the matches yesterday were close. now there's no final. probably a lot of fans that had higher expectations. is it fair for people to be disappointed?
if you were in the same shoes as roger, obviously you're not in his body, going into a davis cup final, his first, little bit of something going on, can you imagine what you might have done in the same situation?
i would like to talk to you about this no.1 achievement. you are 27 now. do you know what will be the next goal in your career? can we consider the french open will be your main goal for the future? do you think about becoming a legend being no.1 five times?
you've spoken at several of the press conferences this year and last about your personal preference to see this tournament move around the world. do you think one of the advantages that london has is that someone like andy murray is here, there's so many former legends that are around or it's easy for them to travel to the tournament?
you just mentioned about new markets. i heard you tried to introduce the atp 500 to your country, to your hometown. is that true? later you stopped doing that. could you tell me the reason, if that's true? your acquaintances, they are looking forward to see you playing tennis in your hometown.
to end on a lighter note, i guess you're going back to domestic duties with the baby. how handson are you? what surprised you the most with the baby and your new role as a father?
at least you got a set. the beginning of the third set was important. you had breakpoints. is it possible to beat novak on this court?
did you have the feeling that he got frustrated by the support the crowd gave you today?
it's been an amazing year for you. you finished no.5. how does it match up with how you expected it to be at the beginning of the year?
you've had a lot of long matches this season. how much fatigue, either physical or mental, a factor this week and today in particular? how is your wrist?
do you think the australian open will be the first grand slam that you go into now feeling like you might be able to win?
you've played all the top players this year, novak, rafa, roger, some of them pretty recently. novak is no.1. do you feel there's much of a gap between him and the other top guys in terms of his play and consistency or the margins still very thin?
how is novak compared to roger and rafa?
you have created history for asia so many times. we have very few asian players on the tour. you compete in the same sport with players with western countries. you have differences with them, culture, language, food. do you feel being a little different with most of the players?
you played in the last week on this court roger and novak. if roger wins tonight, and they play in the final, how do you see it going? what would they need to do against each other?
you won a lot of big matches this year. roger and novak have won a lot of big matches for many, many years. do you have a new appreciation for what they've done now that you've been at that level, or close to it, yourself?
tennis sometimes is cruel. but this was a big fight between two colleagues. four match points. it was a miracle, one of your miracles?
novak said he's physically exhausted. how hard is it mentally for you to keep your cool in this phase of the season?
it was a tough match, and of course it's very late now. how are you going to recover for the match tomorrow?
looking ahead to playing novak. the last time was just a few weeks ago in shanghai. you played an exceptional match there. what are your thoughts going into this one tomorrow night?
you have quite a rivalry with novak. your coaches had quite a rivalry back in their day. how would you compare the two rivalries?
saving match points today, you saved them against monfils, against mayer. how can you compare those comebacks? was this less lucky than the other two?
what was going on between you and the umpire at the beginning of the third set? did you not hear the overrule and the score until love40? do you feel he should have told you more clearly what was going on?
normally you write your name on the camera lens. today you did something different. you just draw a little ball. why?
in the match against kei nishikori in particular, you played three times, at the us open, paris and here, how would you analyze the differences of those three matches, such as indoor versus outdoor, differences of the court surface, so forth?
i think kei nishikori is getting closer to you. is this a good motivation for you?
now you're in the final. to be there is pressure for you? how do you manage that? what is your philosophy?
you just said you were emotionally a little more flat. i was a bit surprised knowing you as a showman that you reacted a little bit badly when the crowd applauded to nishikori because you made a doublefault.
i saw that you were nervous.
no. i'm just asking because normally doesn't happen to you. you lost a little bit the concentration.
i'm trying to understand what happened.
why do you think this particular incident upset you more than usual?
you do seem quite tired tonight. it is unusual, you've taken so long to come in to see us.
is it something that you'll wake up tomorrow and you think you'll feel fresh again with the final in front of you?
millions of television viewers saw your gesture at the end of putting that dot or full stop. why are you so reluctant to share what it meant?
so it's a message, is it?
back to a big event earlier in the year. i'm curious to see if you could draw some lessons from the floods in the former yugoslavia, particularly with regard to the impact of social engagement, not just public figures, but everyday citizens, whether you think social media had a particular role to play in that and whether it put a spotlight on groups like yours, nonprofit groups?
do you think that played a role? did you find that your foundation and other ngo's got more attention because of the crisis?
some historic rivalries in your career obviously. how is the mentality or the feeling different to play against roger here at this stage of your career? is it fair to say that you think that it still has more of an edge than other rivalries in the game?
talking about playing against roger and rafa, did you feel the same kind of spark playing against kei as when you play against roger and rafa?
the obvious question: playing roger tomorrow, you beat him in montecarlo, he's playing better since then, do you have the belief to beat him?
how do you assess your performance in this match?
you obviously looked pretty relieved and pretty happy at the end to get that yearend no.1 ranking. what did it actually feel like on the court when that final point was played?
how important is it to you to finish the year as no.1 compared to a grand slam win?
do you still remember your origins as a player? we always talk about the big tournaments. but when you started to play...
the first tournament you played, who helped you at the beginning?
could you talk about your next matchup against kei. you beat him easily two weeks ago. do you think this time it's going to be a little bit different match?
you're no.1 in the world at the end of the season. you were no.1 in 2011, in '12, and now this year, which makes three out of four years. how do you react to this achievement, which is more impressive than being no.1 just one year?
i was one of the skeptics that thought that the association with boris becker wouldn't work based on his commentary, for instance. but i remember when you won estoril, you were eager to get a more experienced player on your coaching team. talked about maybe john mcenroe. can you tell us how this year went with boris becker by your side. were there any stressful moments? what can you say?
i wanted to know, was tennis your first love? was there ever another sport where you thought you would be good? there are rumors on the alpine ski world cup that coming from a place of skiing, sometimes we have this correlation with kostelic?
you talked a moment ago about being no.1 three years in a difficult era with nadal and federer. talk about margins in this season. you had a great season. but really if you had lost one set in the wimbledon final, maybe we wouldn't be having this conversation.
one more question about your relationship to boris becker. can you be a little more specific in what way boris can help you, what he's good at.
following up your 'everything happens for a reason'. how do you explain murray losing 6love, 61 as they were 1111 in their headtohead? did you ever go through any crisis?
and your crisis?
even though you lost, based on how your previous matches had gone, were you satisfied it was a close match, a threesetter?
can you tell us a little bit about what this year has been for you.
a lot of players have found it difficult to refind the consistency after their first grand slam title. what has been difficult for you? what have been the challenges? has novak been able to give you any advice to see you through this period?
what changed after you winning a grand slam in your daily life, but you answered careerwise. i'm asking about your daily life, the requirements, the media, sponsors' deals. also a specific question related to your answer. you are 198. does that kind of height require specific precautions with trainers compared to a notastall player?
this journey you took this year with goran ivanisevic, can you tell us what he brought not only on the court, but off the court?
the celebration of your us open win was a big occasion back home. there was some controversy due to the presence of the singer thompson. i know you weren't happy that the regional media took the focus away from that. are you familiar with the songs of his that earned him a negative reputation? can you understand why some people might be surprised or upset to see you with him?
you played both roger and stan recently. do you have any idea or thoughts on how that match would go tomorrow?
you had beaten david in several matches this year. this was a confirmation or how did you see the match? difficult or not?
you have a pretty fantastic threeset record this year. i'm wondering if you think that is because of your improved fitness? is it because of confidence? what are you thinking now when you go into a third set?
you were expecting to play a tall, big server. quite soon before the match you find out you're playing ferrer. how difficult was that?
last year you played ferrer. what would you say is the biggest difference in your game last year compared to this year?
how did you feel today when you heard about the swap? were you relieved at all to be playing david?
it's still not final yet, but if you go through to the semis, you'll probably play djokovic. can you talk about playing the top three as against playing the other guys? how difficult it is or how different it is, what you will be required to do?
you said davis cup is very important to you. what is the asian game situation for you? from china you have to sacrifice atp tour or challenger event to play the asian games? did the japanese tennis federation ask you to play or did you have the freedom to not play?
no, the asian games.
how will you follow tonight's match? will you watch it or just get score updates?
it's your first time at the yearend championships. how would you like to see this event back in asia?
i really like sweets. if i want to become a professional tennis player, would i have to give up sweets?
that must have been pretty tough to get through. can you remember a harder night on court than that?
how much of it tonight was down to your own performance and how much was it down to roger's?
at the end of the match he was two points from winning 60, 60. did you care about him not doing that? did you sense he wanted to do that? was it bothering you he was continuing to hit dropshots, running around secondserve returns all the way to the end?
when the games are going so quickly, what sort of things do you try and do to get a foothold in the match?
does a defeat like that do any damage to your confidence, especially as it's the last match of the year? do you put it aside as i've lost a match and move on?
is there any sense in looking back at this game and trying to analyze it or is it such a freakish match that you're better off trying to forget it as quickly as possible?
obviously you haven't been in a lot of matches that have gone that way on the scoreboard. what does it feel like when that's happening? is it surreal, confusing, frustrating, embarrassing?
i went through your heavy defeats in the past. you lost 11 times 60, but you were not matching in the following match after those defeats. you lost 61, 60 to djokovic in miami in 2007, semifinal. since then, in 2008, you always played well. you shouldn't be too worried about tonight.
how do you feel it now?
i appreciate it's only just finished, but how do you sum up your season?
andy, you're 09 against roger, novak and rafa. how far off their level do you feel you are at this point?
between now and the international tennis league, what is your plan? davis cup next week. will you switch off completely?
you've played here many times before. how different is it being the alternate?
you've spent a lot of time on court against kei recently. how impressed are you with his play? what particularly do you think are his weapons?
yes.
how long did you have to prepare?
when did you find out you were actually going to be playing today?
you pulled out of the indian champions league with a back injury. by taking the court today, was that a risk at all for your back?
all the matches have been in two sets. everybody was saying, at least if ferrer was around, we would see three sets, which happened. how did you feel about it? do you have a cold or a sore throat?
could you talk a little bit about your decision to change coaches and how things are going with your new coach?
did you ever consider not coming here as an alternate? a player like dimitrov said he didn't want to come here and be waiting around. did you ever feel like that?
in an interview, oscar hernandez said he was 100% sure there was match fixing in challenger and future events, that the atp is dirty. do you think he has any legitimate reason saying that? what do you think is the best way to tackle this problem?
does it worry you?
how confident are you that you can come back to the o2 next year to play the finals?
kei nishikori has a good record in the final set, winning more than 90%. can you talk about why he always comes back in the final set.
did you consider not playing here at all because of your back problem?
tonight it was too perfect from your part and murray was not there? what is your opinion of such a match?
one professional player once said you're only in the zone two or three times a year. do you agree with that? were you in the zone tonight?
you were the only one the other night who said actually this surface probably is the reason for these straight, easy matches. how do you explain it? last year you had the same surface. is there something you notice that has really changed?
why last year didn't this happen and this year it's happening?
what does it feel being up 60, 50 on one of your toughest rivals?
you said a few times this week you were glad to see that andy had found a good run of form since the us open. what do you sense with him? is it a confidence thing still when he plays the top three guys?
the french was the last time.
there's obviously a lot going on for you this weekend and next weekend. how do you manage to control the anxiety, if there is any? do you feel like there's a huge chance because you still haven't won the davis cup yet?
there's quite a good chance you could play stan in the semifinals. how good would that be to play him here, especially of playing with him at the davis cup?
very unusual event for fans. they only get one singles match per session. they've all been very short. is there anything the tournament can do to give people a better show?
looks like in terms of number of games, it was your worst defeat on the atp. do you have any explanation why matches have been so onesided in this tournament?
what changed in this match? you had a good start, 20. seemed to go pretty quickly after that.
you were saying with the top eight here, everybody is expecting great matches. do you think that expectation is fair? is the expectation too high in terms of the level that fans or the rest of us expect for this final tournament?
you probably saw the reports in recent weeks about the italian players that were named in the soccer match fixing investigation in italy. if this is a concern of yours on the tour in general at the upper level, lower levels?
the way novak is playing right now, compared to the way roger played when he was at his very, very best a few years ago, are you able to do any sort of comparison at all?
in comparison to your australian open victory, what is missing for your game and how do you plan to get it back for next year?
roger said the good thing of this system is that even you have a defeat, you can still pass. do you still have hopes in this tournament?
a lot of players talked about what it was like to see you break through to win at a grand slam this year, being somewhat of a surprise. what were your thoughts when you saw cilic win at the us open, which was a much bigger surprise than you?
if you faced him at the australian open in the same court, do you think the result would be any different?
did you think it could go so easily after you lost the first two games? also, aren't you surprised that eight matches lasted only 8 hours and 26 minutes, which means each match lasts 63.2 minutes on average?
you've played roger, who you might play here this weekend, 36 times. you've played rafa 42 times. how would you rate those two rivalries in terms of which one you've enjoyed more, appreciated more in your career, and which one has been more exciting for fans?
do you have any explanation for the onesidedness of the matches?
with how well you've played in these first two matches, is it all wanting to hope that you can somehow sustain this level for the rest of your career, just this moment, playing like you are now?
i'm sure life feels very different for you since becoming a father, but do you feel different on court?
there's a lot of qualification scenarios on friday. how much do you get involved with that? do you let someone tell you what you have to do on friday or do you sit there with your calculator trying to work it out?
i've been fascinated by the wide range of opinions regarding the court conditions from pundits on the tv, to the players. what is your assessment on the court conditions, speed, ball speed?
as you know, janko tipsarevic has been back on court practicing with some of your other friends the last week or so. what is it going to mean for you personally, but also for serbia's davis cup team, to have him and viktor back regularly on tour next year?
would you like to see this tournament stay in london past 2015? if so, why?
i realize it's probably a bit early for this question, but would you ever like for your son to become a tennis player?
yes.
after your great success in new york, it must be a bit disappointing how you played today and this week. can you talk a little bit about it.
i don't want to be rude, but i'm not going to ask again if you feel sorry, sad or angry. the other day, federer said on the slow court the serve is not so important like moving fast. do you agree with him? do you think that could be a reason why everyone is serving worse than normally you do?
for davis cup, federer winning or not winning, would that have any effect on how you would view his career as a whole?
on friday you're playing against stan wawrinka. what are you thinking about this third match for you?
just to make you relax. did you think about asking goran ivanisevic to come and replace you, serving as he can do? can he still serve as well as you do or not?
does being us open champion make these losses a bit less disheartening than it would have been otherwise?
winning the us open, doing such a huge thing, you obviously can't beat that for the rest of the year. does that maybe make these losses maybe less disappointing?
tomas i'm sure you feel much better today than you did the other day. can you talk a little bit about the last 48 hours, what you did in between the two matches to turn it around.
you've always lost your first match, then won your second match. is that because it's taken you some time to settle on court or perhaps because you're always playing a higherranked opponent in the first match? why is it?
if i'm not mistaken, all of your years here have been in london, and the contract goes through next year. what are your feelings about keeping the event here in london? what is your experience? from a calendar point of view, atmosphere point of view, what are your thoughts on that?
you played marin quite a few times this year. how would you rate his performance? was it one of the worst this year?
what are your thoughts on novak in the next roundrobin match?
it's been seven matches, seven pretty quick straight setters. are you surprised by that? why do you think that has happened?
you would have no problem traveling to the middle east or asia or somewhere else at the yearend championships?
there was a recent naming of several italian tennis players in a soccer match fixing investigation. i'm wondering, what is your level of concern about match fixing in tennis?
in your game it's a lot about belief. do you believe with your best game, you said today this was not the best tennis you could play, that you can challenge novak djokovic?
i want to praise you for your sense of humor. you are great on twitter. you're becoming better and better on press conferences.
apart from that, in the year 2009, there were 10 matches out of 15 at the masters, the atp finals, that went to a third set. now you see it's a fact that seven matches went two sets. do you think there's a difference between maybe now, now maybe players are more satisfied, they have less hunger because once you lose the first set, i won't say quit, but you don't fight as much to come back? i'm trying to provoke a clever answer.
are you good in mathematics? do you know you still can qualify? do you know what you need to do in order to qualify?
your firstserve percentage against roger was low. today was about 50%. something you can put your finger on why playing indoors? is it the pressure of facing roger and andy backtoback?
overall what do you think has been not working for you at this tournament?
you played him in indian wells when he was still sort of struggling a bit to come back from the back problem. how do you feel his level is now?
you said you played the two matches with the tactics of your opponents. how do you think you need to play your next match if it's to reflect your game?
in the last game you hit a couple really fantastic shots and a couple real clunkers. that must be frustrating for you. do you have any explanation or is it that you're going for it?
you have already played with kei four times this season. what do you need to do to beat him, particularly on this surface?
for yourself, along with kei and marin, this is a whole new experience, playing the seasonending championship. i think kei is the only one who scored one win. how much does that have a bearing on the way you've approached this or the way you're playing?
intrinsically the speed of the court would be the same. how does the huge area around the court play with the speed? at the french open, people say that center court plays slower because the area around the court is so big. is that a factor?
with regard to andy murray, you said it was more about murray adjusting to you as opposed to you adjusting to him. what is the case nowadays?
talking about the serve, is the serve the problem? is that affecting your ground game or is it maybe vice versa?
what exactly could you do in your own head during that match to make the serve better? what can you do with your coaches tomorrow to try to get it better for the next match?
how much happier are you feeling with that performance than you were on sunday?
late in the second set especially, he was being a lot more aggressive with his return of serve. what was your strategy at that point?
it's always difficult for us to assess the importance of a coach in moments like that. how important were the discussions you had with amlie after your loss?
you have been already through this tournament in a difficult mathematical situation with del potro, making a lot of calculations. how do you expect to play against federer? how much could it be a problem to know if he wins one set, he's number one, if he makes more than nine games...
how would you assess the speed of the court? how would you assess the fact that there's a huge area around the court that would interfere with the speed of the court?
what are your thoughts on playing roger in the last of the roundrobin matches?
you're 11all with roger at the moment in terms of headtohead records. i was just wondering if you'd thought about finishing your career with a winning headtohead record against possibly one of the greatest tennis players of all time, if that was an aim at all with you?
can you believe it's 10 years that you've been playing roger? that's split evenly, 11 wins each man. quite something, isn't it? something you'd be proud of, i imagine?
your mom has shown some impressive staying power, the dancing competition. what sort of game show or reality show do you think you would have the best chance of excelling at?
what would be your category or choice?
you've played roger plenty of times in london. do you think it's more difficult to play him here or at wimbledon?
following your win, you received the arthur ashe humanitarian award. how does it make you feel and does it inspire you to do any more in that area?
your fifth time playing milos. he struggled with his serve today. where would you put his serve today compared to the other times you've faced him?
this is your 13th finals here, consecutive years. kei qualified for the first time here. i think you have the advantage because you have experience. does it affect you, help you?
following his win over andy on sunday, kei spoke of his confidence. has that been the biggest change over the season? do you think that was something he perhaps lacked today?
with the round robin, there's a possibility you might be qualified for the semifinals before your next match starts. if that is the case, how do you balance wanting to rest a little bit or save yourself for the semifinals, and wanting to give a good effort in the last match?
what do you think about the fact that five matches went just in two sets? only your match with raonic, the second set was a fight, 76. how do you explain it? could it be at the end of the season, players are tired, they don't fight as much, don't have the same hunger?
andy has had a very good end of the season. the one thing he hasn't done so far is beat either you, rafa or novak. how important a step is that for a player and how important was it for you when you'd gone through your bad times to win that first match against one of the top guys?
you're closing in on a thousand wins in your career, but 70 this year. i think it's the first time somebody your age has won that many matches in three decades. what does that say to you?
both teams have named their davis cup teams. no surprises. i wondered if you might say a few words about the strength of the french team.
can you compare the previous matches against kei nishikori? any difference in kei today?
you touched on the thousand matches situation. you said that is in your mind to some degree. is the number one ranking in your mind at all as you continue to play here?
if you could take a second to look at men's tennis through the eyes of a fan, would you be excited about the new generation coming through or are you thinking it's never going to be this good again for a generation?
did you expect to produce that sort of performance today?
it's one against one. obviously he didn't have his best day, you had a good day. is it possible for you to say which was more? were you playing a particularly good match or did you get the sense he was there for the taking?
do you know the score of the first set was the same as the federer/raonic match yesterday?
good for the davis cup.
you have the best record on tour against the top 10 this year, you're 71. against everyone else, you win twothirds of the time. you're winning more against the top 10. why is that?
have you spent any time on clay practicing this fall?
when you and roger won the olympic gold medal, do you feel that changed the perception of you in switzerland? do you feel if you're able to win, it will have the same effect, changing how you're viewed?
you obviously know roger as well as anybody probably on the tour. if he does do well here, are you entirely confident that at 33, he's going to have the legs still to perform right to the end of what's already been a pretty long, hard season for him?
what is your relationship with tomas berdych? how well do you get along? how do you see him as a player or a person?
we see a lot of new faces in this tournament, such as nishikori, cilic, raonic. all of them said they got inspired by you, motivated by your victory in australia. how do you feel about being inspiration for younger players?
obviously there are no french players here, but i was wondering what things were like in paris, given that the davis cup final is coming up? were you staring each other down, you and the french players? are things kind of normal?
you had beaten marin many times, but this was too much? the veterans are marking the land?
it was such a confident display by you. you've not lost a match in shanghai. you've not lost here in london. do you remember when you lost last time? what does this win do for your confidence and for the fact that you're on another winning run?
stan won 61, 61. you win 61, 61. are those surprising scorelines, in your opinion, for a tournament like this?
you may correct me if i'm wrong, but i think you haven't lost indoors since you lost to querrey in paris bercy. what has changed with you? four years ago your best surface probably was hard court. now it seems to be indoors. is that correct? where do you feel more confident right now?
is it just the surface? something related to this specific period of the year? what makes the difference compared to the others? sometimes you look a bit spent, and you reach a peak at this time of the year.
if federer wins the davis cup, in your mind will that put him in a different light as far as his career? secondly, last year when you came in here, you very harshly criticized the governing body of tennis, the doping. you didn't trust it. you said they were unprofessional. i'm just wondering a year later if you feel the same way or differently? what do you think about troicki almost making his way back to the top 100?
i'd like to ask about one of your next opponents, tomas berdych. what is your relationship? how do you see him as a player and as a person?
you were spotted at the doubles last night. i'm curious what you think about zimonjic's return? what does it mean to you to have a player like nenad on tour when you were just getting started?
the poppies that everybody wears here, what you think about what it means?
do you recall sort of first noticing people were doing it here and asking about it?
which is your most memorable memory with grigor dimitrov this year?
can you try to explain to us what happens when a champion of the us open comes, plays, loses 61, 61 in 56 minutes? today, another player, berdych, the same thing. it's difficult for us to explain it to the readers. can you give us a clue?
you mentioned rust. how did you find the conditions on the court? are they conditions that you like?
when you're in a situation like that and you're trying and trying to get back into a match, what is actually going through your mind? are you looking for a big hole just to crawl into? how are you reacting mentally during a match like that?
a lot of players have talked about the difficulty of coming in and playing a top player in the first match at an event like this. what about the feeling of going on the court, your first time here? did you feel nerves? was it overwhelming? you played novak pretty close this year. today wasn't so close.
you said you used to think too much on the court, and now you want to be a simple man. how difficult is it to keep it simple here because every experience is a new experience to you, and you have too much new information to process?
in your pretournament conference, you talked about the rise of the exyugoslavian players and balkan players. what do you think is the secret ingredient? is it the hunger to succeed or opportunities?
for your next opponent, tomas berdych, are you friends? how do you see him as a player or a person?
how do you handle coming from this sort of match? what adjustment do you have to make to this format?
obviously you're introduced as a grand slam champion everywhere you go now. what has really changed in your daily life in these last two months?
a great server like you who doesn't win one serve in the second set, are you more angry, more sad, or more embarrassed?
how much of that is just a bad matchup for you? what about your general level of play today?
how much of it is just your own mental state of mind, late in the season, tired, mentally, physically? what's going on?
you lost the first four games very quickly today, like 15 minutes. how surprised were you at that start? did you feel you were starting to panic? did you try to work your way out of it?
did you feel like you were hitting the ball well during practice all week or even during the warmup before today's match? when you stepped on the match court, it just wasn't there?
you've never won your first match here, but you've always gone on to win the second match. is that to do with the format and peaking straightaway against the best players?
you and ivan lendl are the only two czechs to have played the finals five times. i wondered if you admired him when you were a kid. was he one of your idols? do you still think about working with him in the future?
a good win for roger federer yesterday. it seems this has been a bit of resurgence year for him. what do you think his key to return to form has been recently?
switching to davis cup for a second. you've been an active player. do you think it's fair when players receive criticism for not playing for their country in davis cup or is that fair when they are criticized for not playing?
if federer were not to win in the davis cup, would you look at his career in a different light?
can you tell us a few words about the game of marin cilic this season and how you're going to prepare to play against him? you have to win that match to have a chance to go through.
are you surprised with the level of his game this season?
how did you find the court surface today? how does it compare to the previous four years you qualified?
you had your good chances in the second set. do you think it could have gone to a third, or roger is more experienced than you?
it's your first time here. did it take you a set to get going?
you play andy next. you have a good record against him. how do you think this court will play out for the match between you?
i wondered how intimidating it felt to be playing in such a huge arena and with a lot of support on roger's side? did that have an impact on you or could you blank that out?
did it feel different walking out on court tonight mentally? did it feel like just another match?
the set point and the breakpoints, which one was the most disappointing or frustrating for you?
is it strange losing a match, knowing you're going to have to get over it right away and prepare for the next one?
this is just after the match, but it's poppy time. i wonder if you usually wear one and how you learned about what it means and its significance? also, have you noticed the ones here are a little bit different.
obviously this tournament is a lot different from wimbledon. how does it feel for you specifically being here in london, sort of the wintertime, in a city that usually you're here in the summer? how do the two events compare to each other?
you mentioned a moment ago the crowd often supports roger. how do you expect the french crowd to react to him in the davis cup final coming up? do you think it's fair when players are criticized for not suiting up for their country in davis cup?
you just played him in paris. did you sense he adjusted in some way to what you did? was it a matter of his level being higher, or your level being lower this time?
a lot of work went into getting into this event. apart from what happened in the match today, has it been what you expected?
andy murray just mentioned that you are playing with more confidence. that was the difference. where do you think the confidence came from today?
he saved the three breakpoints at 3love in the second set, then he got back to 4all. is that a situation that maybe a year ago you'd have lost the match or would have lost the second set, whereas now you have the confidence to put that behind you and still dominate?
you've obviously been practicing on that court. did you find the conditions any different today when you played a match? how would you describe the conditions today?
andy murray was the favorite for most of the people. do you think kei nishikori can win this tournament?
after such a great year, do you expect wins like this from yourself?
in your career you have had many injuries and problems. have you changed something in your preparation? do you do anything different or not?
you talked about li na giving you motivation. when i ask some chinese men player if you are their motivation, a few of them argue that you're not the typical asian player because you have always trained in the u.s. for asian men's player, do you think training overseas is the only way they can be as good as you compared to staying in asia?
you just came in here on your debut and you beat a grand slam champion on his home court kind of. i'm wondering, in japanese culture, it's often that you give respect to your elders, the way of thinking is to give respect. did you ever have to change that mentality inside yourself, or you always had the feeling you could go out there and beat anyone?
you are the first asian men's player to qualify for this tournament. how much help have you got over the years from the japanese country, the japanese tennis federation, the fans, all the people in your country?
i know that you trained in america from the early years. i want to know how much help financially, help from the japanese tennis federation, the fans, the country.
after all the hard work of getting here, were you surprised to lose that one in straight sets?
you seemed to play with more attacking intent when you came back to 4all in the second set. was it his game that prevented you from being aggressive throughout?
you called the trainer in the second set. were you feeling fatigued?
after your sixweek run, nobody could have been more matchtough than you. i'm wondering, in the break between you losing at bercy and starting here, how many complete days off did you take, just not touch a racquet?
did you feel any nerves out there? early on particularly, both you and kei seemed to make quite a lot of mistakes.
it's been a little while since you played kei. what are the biggest improvements you've seen in his game since the previous time you played him?
do you feel like this puts you very up against it in terms of trying to make the last four?
on a side note, you've spoken about why wearing the poppy is important to you. talk a little bit about how you learned about what it means and whether you've been asked about it from players from other countries?
given the nature of the way you got to the finals in the first place, is there enough in the tank to do things the hard way again this week?
i saw a comment from you saying you still need to find an extra 4% or 5% to get back to your top level. has it surprised you how long the process has taken and how frustrating has that been?
how does the court, the speed and the bounce, play compared to some of the other courts you've been on indoors the last few weeks? how would you describe it?
is that rehab process affecting your servicing action, which was suggested by greg rusedski in the paper today? have you adjusted especially your second serve?
great week, but obviously a tough way to finish. what were your thoughts on what you weren't able to sort of close the gap with? it seemed like late in the first especially it was pretty tight for a lot of it.
how was your feeling before going on the court? nervous?
did your final in canada at all prepare you for this sort of feeling of a masters final? did you think back to that experience at all?
you're headed to london for the first time for the masters. what are you expecting out of that?
have you ever feared to be whistled like ivanisevic because of your serve?
whistled by the public?
your serve didn't work as well as against roger federer. do you think it was because novak was able to return well or you were a bit apprehensive today?
wellplayed. congratulations. first man to win here successive years. that's something different.
yeah, it was great. almost 100% except for eight points you suddenly lost in the middle there. what happened there? there was a period of eight consecutive points that you lost.
with london coming up, does it matter to you who's in your group or anything with the way you're playing, especially indoors or anything? do you feel pretty much ready to go against anybody and everybody?
do you wish there was more of an indoor season now? there used to be a lot more indoor events than there are now.
you received some treatment on your calf at 52. is it something that happened during the match? what happened?
you still have two main goals: london and the no.1. how do you see this battle with roger for the no.1?
you obviously returned really well today. was that the focal point going in? and also, i think bozovic was here helping you a little bit, helping you on the return. was that special for you guys, too?
if you can answer in french it's better for me, radio. davis cup final. how do you see this tie, this exciting tie?
back in january, how surprised would you have been if someone had said the man challenging you for no.1 would be roger federer?
are you going to play the itpa after london?
do you think that this these kind of events, exhibition tournaments, can become a threat for the atp tour?
i'd like to ask you if you had any injury or problems, because i saw that your service wasn't as good as expected.
i guess now you will be focusing for the finals in london. with what thoughts will you go there?
i'm just curious, what time you go to bed last night?
do you regret that nadal won't be there, or you think you'll have a better chance with his absence?
i wanted to ask if you regret that nadal won't be there or you're enjoying the fact that a star player is missing so you will have more chances of winning more games.
a very fluent victory. can you tell us the match from your perspective?
when you look back that us open final against kei, what have you learned from that?
semifinal, yeah.
you obviously have great focus on the court, but this week with all that has gone on in your life the last ten days, are there moments where you're thinking about your wife or your kid while you're actually playing on court?
a lot of players say they don't take a lot of pleasure to play against a player like raonic because he serves so well and there is no rally. it's too difficult to return. considering the fact that the return is probably one of your best strokes, do you take pleasure from that?
i'd like to ask you about the finals in london, what you expect, and considering also the absence of rafa nadal.
obviously there is not a lot of talk in the last five, six years about the sort of golden age of tennis that people consider it to be now with you and rafa and roger. having played kei and about to play milos, do you think these guys will be able to keep up that level, or will it be just sort of a different generation, different era, and people will have to accept in the next few years?
you are in pole position for the yearend no.1 spot. you're now a father. you're in great physical shape. would you say this is one of the best periods of your life?
how do you assess today's match out there?
now you go right now in london or you wait a week for recovering?
can you comment the way milos played today and his whole week here.
can you just comment the way milos raonic played today.
can you just walk us through the match from your perspective and how you felt like things worked out?
where does this rank for you as far as wins in your career? is it one of the biggest? the best?
do you think this is some kind of a small breakthrough? i mean, given the situation, you're in london, that sort of thing; beating federer for the first time. you have never beaten anybody in the top well, nadal, djokovic, federer. first time you beat any of them. aren't you a little bit excited?
how motivated are you for london? how do you keep that out of the way when you still have a semifinal to play?
how do you see that next match against berdych from your point of view?
comparing to your two previous matches, does it change something when you play on central court in terms of motivation or...
and your game has improved since yesterday. how do you explain it?
do you care the result of the rivals that are competing for the race to london, or do you avoid to watch the results of rivals?
(english.) it will be nice to hear a few words in french as to the joy, what represents for you to beat federer for the first time.
(french.) and you think you can win the tournament now?
i can only guess, but i'm supposing that after sort of the six weeks of solid play, found a little run at the end that you couldn't sort of stem the tide; is that sort of what was behind that?
towards the end you seemed to be hurting a little bit. are you okay physically?
there has been a lot of talk about novak's work with boris and coming to the net more. do you think he's added elements to his game this year?
people talk about it. i don't know if the stats back it up or not.
you have won a massive number of matches this fall. do you think there is a different sort of level you haven't been able to hit in terms of going up against the other members of the big four so far this year? is it just a little bit of a ceiling you're hitting there does it feel like at all?
i know it's early days. you've just walked off court. but do you leave here with a sense of disappointment having lost to novak, or a sense of mission accomplished, i've got to london, you've done what you've wanted?
i think you've never lost to milos before. what made the difference today?
how does his serve compare with karlovic or an isner, for example?
before the match you said something to the effect that raonic takes the racquet out of your hand. of his 55 points that he won on serve, 21 were aces. is that how you felt during the match?
you mentioned the margins being smaller indoors. do you think that's why so many different guys have been able to win this tournament over the past few years compared to the other masters events, or something else you think contributes to that different sort of result we see here compared to everywhere else?
does this change anything about your preparations going to london? are you going to stay on the indoor hard for now? anything else looking ahead to clay?
looking briefly ahead of london, you have taken over for rafa now as the sort of headline player in the indian league, in the team. can you tell us about that and the background to that?
will you play in india and dubai?
what is your state of mind now that you're going to leave paris?
did you feel that if he hadn't served that well you couldn't have lost that match? i mean, if he's not as good with his serve?
you still can become no.1 and you still have the davis cup. do you still feel those two goals can be achieved?
fabrice was talking the no.1 spot; you lost an opportunity maybe catching up with djokovic.
we didn't see you in a halloween mask today, novak. too much a serious occasion for that?
i think that's seven wins in eight matches against andy. do you feel you've got a little bit of a mental edge over him at the moment?
but do you feel you know how to beat him now?
because you said at the us open you said that you felt that if you stayed with him you'd have the edge physically, but then maybe he's  all the work he's done the last five weeks maybe he's a little bit more conditioned.
obviously today's circumstances aside, do you feel like in general when you play against andy it's physically more grueling? because you two have a way of making tennis not look very fun when you play. it just looks painful sometimes.
you talk about your serve. milos raonic had a great service game before you, sort of 240 ks. you don't get great speed, but you land it with amazing accuracy. it's just a different style.
do you expect much the same with david or kei tomorrow compared to what you had tonight, or what do you expect from either of them?
do you ever play photographer with boris beck? he posts these sort of hilarious instagram photos. they are usually staged in some sense.
stan, when a match is so tight it's difficult to find an explanation, but at 54, 30love, what happened?
of course you will go london without many victories under your belt. do you believe before that you will have time to get your confidence back or something?
you know how people are. they are worried about what is happening to you. are you going to be able to win again. but you always say for the masters and the davis cup there is no worries; is that right? everything is fine?
besides the lack of confidence, you've been experiencing many new things this year: becoming a player among the top 5 and all this. many ups and downs.
you were up 30love and you lost that game. your physio threw the bottle on the ground. what did they say to you after?
are you very sick or can we expect a tweet with your socks next week?
is it possible to have friends among the top 5? i know you were good friends with jo for a long time. but since both of you are competitors, has your relationship changed?
so with this inconsistent season, wouldn't the explanation be that it was due to the grand slam? roger, rafa said, he's sort of taking in this victory in the grand slam. it'll come back. do you see it like this?
so what is your feeling after that match? you fought for your chances or you wanted to do better?
you thought you could have done better today or you think you did your best?
can you tell us what it is like to play on such a big court, and in the evening on top of it?
yesterday you played in the evening, too.
what tactics did you think about before playing him? and was it easier to have a game plan against him?
thanks to this week, are you going to change your goals for 2015? maybe higher goals now?
congratulations. you looked quite in control for the first set and a half, and then it became really complicated. how did you feel?
you're getting closer and closer to london, too. do you feel the pressure of this race also?
i have two questions: first of all, would you consider this was your best year until now? and the second one, can you please tell me the advantages and disadvantages of being a player of your height, not that tall like the others on the circuit.
i was just thinking about the match against cilic.
how has your life changed since the us open?
what do you mean the players? how did you notice them seeing you differently?
you have ferrer next. thoughts on that match.
i know you were probably keeping an eye on other people's results, but is it quite nice to secure that spot to london with one of your results rather than somebody else's?
considering where you were at the us open rankingwise, how do you rank this as an achievement? it's not winning a title, but getting into london as high as you have now, what sort of the achievement is that for you?
what is it that you like about playing indoors? it's not as big a part of calendar as it used to be, but pretty much you pretty much play as much as possible.
how would you assess your performance today particularly compared with some of the other matches you've had in the last six weeks?
just going back to indoors, do you like the sort of rock concert element, the light show and theatrics that go on here and the o2?
can you tell us a bit more about the little autograph you left on the camera lens. was it a kind after jibe at your critics?
just some thoughts on your next opponent.
i was wondering why you typically choose to receive instead of serve, like today?
going back to the memory bank, can you remember a similar situation when you've got no experience whatsoever on a big stage, playing a big player. was there an instance where you had to do what he had to do?
were you nervous in any of them?
andy qualified today for world tour finals. from your perspective, how important do you think it is to have a local player in any sort of event, maybe from your experience in basel, for ticket sales and overall health of an event?
yesterday you were saying that you needed to play a match against lucas to know what his potential was. what do you think?
it was a good style of game to prepare for raonic?
i guess it's never easy to play against someone who is an idol for you. it was the same for dimitrov and goffin. what did you think?
we talked with the public, and the question they ask all the time about you is  it has nothing to the match. they say where did you meet your wife? how and when?
did you make the first step or did she?
another question: there so many goals in the end of the season with the davis cup, masters, et cetera, so how can you keep going? how can you meet those goals?
you are very popular in france, like in many other places. some people think that in the davis cup in france maybe the crowd will not play its part. they might also cheer for you. can you feel when you play the respect of the public and that respect might help your team there?
so this win is a good thing for you, or you were not worried about the bad series of losses?
what happened after the us open? you played too much before? did you expect this would happen, or you didn't?
is it tough to know that you can have ups and downs, or are you just used to it and you know it's going to come back?
the end of this season is pretty busy, so what is your state of mind here in this tournament in paris? you just want to find your confidence and the rhythm? or because you have a lot to do this week, next week, and then the davis cup final?
jo, for example, is thinking only about the davis cup. gal, too. they are careful. they don't want to get injured. how do you react to this, to the davis cup coming up?
it's been quite a tough couple of weeks for you recently. how big is this win, on this court? is it important to get the groove back?
are you feeling frustrated? frustrating past two weeks?
are you still hoping to go to london?
just a funny question: you made a break of eight minutes approximately. why it was so long?
now the public blow [sic] you.
when you came up on the court?
did you feel in the tiebreak that you were maybe serving for your season, given the fact that the london race is the way it is?
you have beaten jack five times this year, i think, which is more than probably anybody else. what do you see in his game that works for you? they're tight matches where you've been able to get the better every time.
specifically what's getting better for him?
if your season had to stop here and you're not going to london, unfortunately, how would you assess it, your 2014?
talking specifically about london, are you following the calculations if you qualify or not qualify, or is it not in your mind whatsoever?
did you have a specific game plan before playing him? were you able to implement it?
there's fognini the player and fognini the special character. were you able to manage the tension he puts into a match?
federer said you hit with him in australia once. it was in january?
you said he was your idol earlier. what do you like in his game?
you practiced with stan and with roger. do you learn something every time?
we could be surprised to see you play here; it's not surprising, however. are you surprised?
but it's also your personality. you are someone very well organized. you're not someone who gets carried away.
talking about fognini, there was a little incident at the end of the match. the umpire refused to shake hands with him. do you know what happened?
were you able to hit on center court? and secondly, is this how you had imagined you would reach the top level, you know, playing this kind of tournament?
didn't seem to be any kind of signs of physical hangover from sunday the way you sort of went at that from the start today.
how do you find the courts here? i mean, it seems to me that the courts here change from year to year perhaps more than anywhere else. would that be right?
you need one more victory to qualify for london now. will that play on your mind for your next match, or...
could you give us a rundown of your thoughts on who you are likely to play tomorrow, both guys?
a wee bit of chance for revenge over previous matches with him this year?
were you hoping for some edge here and in the pop quiz at the end yeah?
just going back to the london tournament, a couple of weeks ago it appeared that you had no chance; then suddenly you're back in with a very, very good chance after a great run of results. what do you attribute that run to? is it just pure luck or hard work or you just met the right guys at the right time? you have been playing well, as well.
just wondering, playing this indoor stretch of the season, does it feel like a full swing to you now? it's only a few tournaments you play here, but does it feel like a big, sizeable chunk of the calendar that's focused on this?
you like the part of the indoor with all the light show and all the production stuff they can do at these tournaments now? do you enjoy that, or do you like the more traditional...
can you tell me if you have a favorite from the challenge that you launched on twitter regarding what you would like to do in india?
obviously your results suggest that you're still utterly focused on your career, but you're making possibly plans looking longer term ahead in the future with your management company and stuff. i mean, for now, are you involved in that much, or are you kind of a sleeping partner, so to speak?
davis cup final coming up. do you think it's at all strange that it will be four men who live in switzerland playing against switzerland?
do you ever see them when you're there?
can i just get you to talk about the match today and how difficult it was out there for you? were you expecting such a tough match? how did you turn it around?
you say you're feeling fresh, but i wonder, at any stage did you think about not playing here because of the busy end to the season?
was the world no.1 ranking part of that thinking in playing here?
if you were a davis cup captain, would you choose chardy in the french team to play against you?
how can you explain the beginning of that match today? were you not able to hit on center court before your match?
you are going to play lucas pouille. do you know him?
what do you think of his potential?
we are three weeks away from davis cup now. what is the atmosphere with the french players? are you joking together when you see them? what happens?
before coming here in paris you were in basel at home, and soon you're going to be again with your cocitizens in davis cup. you are the swiss citizen that is the most famous in the world. how does it feel to represent switzerland? do you have obligations because of that? you have to give an image of your country?
but you also have a good relationship with france. they will be the opponents for davis cup. we couldn't find anybody criticizing you. it isn't normal?
with how well you have played against roger this year in the three matches, do you think you'd be a good pick for davis cup, trying to find the best french player to matchup against him?
and lastly, when you have one of these close matches against him, how much does the indoor environment here change the intensity of the match?
how do you react after a match like this, a great match?
52, set point, do you believe what happened there had no incidence for the rest of the match?
but we felt he was taking time to get into that match. did you feel he was improving with the match?
he's playing a lot of events right now. how did you feel he was playing?
you have been going up to the net, like in valencia against robredo. is this a change in your game that is there to stay?
question about davis cup. the entire french team seems like lives in switzerland. they are playing switzerland. does this strike any of you as strange? no?
why do you all live there?
how much time do you spend there?
in the second set you came back, you broke back. did you feel at that moment that you could play better, or did you know it was going to be too difficult?
the first set was difficult against him, wasn't it?
apparently murray is the only top 4 player you never beat. is there something in his game that bothers you?
how do you feel mentally? are you tired just before the davis cup? how are you going to spend those weeks now?
you will end the year top 30. is it important for you?
how is it going with the swiss players? is there more tension than usual? stan came here and he was sort of saying that you were talking too much about davis cup and every loss was an excuse and everything.
i just have a quick question about davis cup. do you think it's at all strange that the davis cup final is four men who live in switzerland playing against switzerland?
why do you all live there? is it the obvious tax reason?
a question about davis cup. do you have a strong memory about this competition? we wish you will be playing in lille in a few days.
would it be a highlight of your career to play in this final? it's a team event, and tennis is usually an individual game.
there were ups and downs in that match against verdasco today. how did you feel? was it because of his game, or you were not playing your best tennis?
when you say you can't control the ball, why is it so?
when is the last time those balls bothered you?
(question off microphone.)
but other players can manage. why does it happen to you?
you play john isner next. when you played against him in newyork you had the majority of the crowd on your side, it seemed like. so what do you think it will be like in your country in it was already so good in his?
pretty good for you, i'm guessing.
the other question i have is about davis cup. do you think it's strange that the davis cup final will be four men who live in switzerland playing against switzerland?
a little.
about the davis cup, do you have any special memory that stays in your mind about davis cup as a spectator? anything?
well, davis cup is a team event. what does it mean for you? friends?
do you have the answer you were waiting for after that match?
what is the issue, the organization? you talked with guy?
so what are you going to do now?
maybe the risk is that you're going to get caught in the challenge of this tournament.
yesterday you seemed very determined. you said, i don't want to play for myself. i want to play for the team. so what did guy tell you to make your change your mind?
so why does guy want to see you feeling good?
the fact of playing several matches is important, no? because you were going to play just metz and then go directly to the davis cup final.
what is your best memory of davis cup? is it the atmosphere? do you have any special memory of a final, i mean?
but on television maybe? anything that struck you?
back to your match in valencia, you were playing well except maybe at some moments. were you annoyed because you were playing well?
in the beginning today, it was tough for you to get into that match. what bothered you? the surface? your opponent?
what did you do between the singles and the doubles? is it easy to become friends again after a match like this?
so now what do you have to do to go just one step further? a bit of luck, too?
if you win that match against federer, do you feel you might be selected for the davis cup team?
you played federer twice this year, in the beginning and the middle of the season. the second match was just when he became a father and you won him. but was this victory very significant for you? it was not just because he had just become a father.
so it was a match posing two french players with a wildcard. was it special?
a good attitude, then?
what do you expect in the next match against berdych?
well, precisely. you have opposite styles of game. are you going to be aggressive or are you going to try to play like gilles with the sort of shots without any rhythm or things like that?
(question about the season.)
after the first set, did you feel better? you were able to put your game together? or did he play better?
everybody talks to you about the davis cup all the time. are you really focused on this particular tournament?
but can you play here without giving it all?
is it important for you to win matches before this davis cup?
you were supposed to go to valencia or basel and you didn't go.
did you practice on clay a little?
how many tickets do you have for the final?
do you have any left?
could you spare one or two?
you're going to create a sort of contest?
you were saying you had some injuries this year. do you just think it was bad luck, or are you playing the efforts of last year?
i think you pulled out from asian exhibition?
talk about getting that break there in the third set and the getting to the tiebreaker.
given all the moments that you had last year, does it sort of make handling losses easier? does it not seem such a big deal when you know you're fit and healthy and playing well?
what did you tell yourself when novak was serving for the match at 54 that helped you break him?
rafa went down pretty early in the tournament. murray lost to raonic; stan lost. all the talk was, it's sort of a dawning of a new day; the locker room is changing. yet what happened in the end? two champions, two old champions emerge. what's your thought about the state of the game in that context?
but a new age hasn't exactly arrived?
you're the man now.
you were very complimentary about the tournament, but what do the kids and mirka like to do around them? what do they like around indian wells?
can i ask you about miami? what are your thoughts right now? are you going to go back home or are you going to skip it?
i know it's not your goal or your focus, but what do you think it might mean for you later this year if you're able to get back to no.1 in the rankings?
did you feel how much that crowd was for you? did you feel that?
you were just saying about all those people that pretty much discounted you the way you were playing, etcetera. in one sense, do you think they are eating humble pie now, or does that not really matter to you?
from your comments yesterday, it seemed pretty clear that you had a really tough year last year physically. what was your level of confidence that your body was going to come back so you're able to do the things you are doing now?
you mentioned that you were surprised about how fast you felt you got back into rhythm given that you made it to the final, even though you didn't win but thinking of what's coming. are you content with that, you know, level?
there is a local kid who has hit with you. would you mind talking a little bit about him and your thoughts about him.
the other day you suggested maybe three out of five sets here for the final. did you feel like that today, that you would like it to be three out of five?
at what time in your career do you think you were playing your best tennis? how did your level now compare with that?
you're feeling that now?
when you play a guy like this, played him so many times, you have seen everything he can do, does that bring more strategy and tactics into a match or less or does it come back just to execution?
when you go into a match like this...
you said maybe proving people wrong, after the us open there were a few people saying it was sad to see you losing fourth round maybe not playing your best and that you should retire because it was unfortunate to see you after you had been so good for so long. did you take anything from that? do you enjoy proving people wrong?
is that something you have always had, that ability?
one thing novak said yesterday was that he uses part of his team to analyze his opponents's game. how much data do you have when you're going into a match, or do you simply play by feel? how much do you use all the statistics in data that's out there now?
was it a slight sense of relief at the end, a number of different points, and roger had beaten you the last time, and you weren't able to serve it out and then results in your first title of the year.
obviously he played such a good first set. you had to dig deep. is there satisfaction winning?
just like in the semifinal, you had a chance to serve out the match. didn't get it done.
yeah. just like the semifinal, you recovered, though, this time a little bit shorter time. how do you pick yourself up from that low so quickly, especially in a thirdset tiebreak?
i'm sure that winning any masters series title and your first title here is exciting in and of itself, but how satisfying is this win, given what happened in dubai, the loss?
but the win over roger, in particular.
when he broke, when you were serving for that match, roger said he was trying to put pressure and he wanted to show you that he was still there, and then he said he was going to take it. how did it feel when you were on the court, and how did you play it out?
correct me if i'm wrong, you still do own a tournament in belgrade?
well, let's switch to this. considering so many players from serbia right now are still in the game, how do you see the future of the serbian tennis? is there any name we don't know about that you see and that you know about?
how about your brothers? do they still have ambitions, your two brothers?
everyone in tennis, or a lot of people in tennis, part of the fun is looking at trends. when stan won in melbourne, people said, that's interesting, a new guy winning the slam. and here, murray lost, nadal lost. people are talking about, hey, there is talk in the locker room, maybe a new day is coming. but in the end, it was two of the great masters up there fighting each other. could you just talk about the trends in tennis? are the changes coming but it hasn't happened yet?
for the match at the start, your first service game, you know, he broke you and it seemed to us, to me at least, a little shaky. can you talk about what goes through your mind with that kind of start, what you kind of did to get back on track? seemed like you were playing better as the match went on.
can you talk a little bit about shaking off those starts? you say cilic, you lost the first set, and that was...
you have had marian here in your corner here this week. have you had much contact with boris?
what do you discuss? is it the mental aspects?
you gave him a couple of hugs in the end.
is it just a few little things he says that just bring back elements of your game that perhaps have drifted away, or...
last time you mentioned grit. you know, grit is a very interesting word in sports. you play with zest. are you familiar with the word "zest"? it's with, you know i think you're playing you seem happier. do you think you are?
compared to maybe last year.
last year, yes.
after the anderson game you talked about how before that match you saw the weather and you thought, maybe it will be windy. you said you've been through that before. is there anything you haven't seen like weatherwise and conditionswise?
would you say the experience that you had was a little bit of an edge for you today?
wondering if there is any added significance for you having played this well here this year since this is where things went sour for you. does that make it any sweeter this year?
having won so much this week, does it make you rethink miami at all? you're going to have six matches here.
how important were the few days you had here with stefan? a lot is made of coaches aren't here or are here. you had few days with him first part of the week of the tournament. what do you do with that in that period when he's not here?
could you be more specific about the year of injuries? was it a bad back? when did it happen?
it happened here?
second round? it just never went away or just how long...
here was it serving? was it reaching for a return?
all the of a sudden you felt it and you knew?
how badly the back injury affected your performance last year, what kind of changes did you make to your routine and preparation?
even after all these years of watching you, i think even us in the media were taken aback at some shots you come up with as winners. in the middle of a match do you surprise yourself at times with some of the points that you play? i mean that in a positive sense.
you have hit a lot of incredible shots. following up. there was the tweener against gasquet, a lot of let cord shots that are really special, and that overhead you hit off of a roddick overhead. can you think of in your own career kind of two or three that were special to you during your career?
if it is novak, obviously you have played each other in lots of big matches. maybe not for a while. how much do you relish the opportunity to play against him in the final?
you have high expectations of yourself, but how have the results you have had this year sort of aligned with what you expected so far?
if it's isner and not djokovic...
you want to talk a little bit about the second set? looked like you had the match, and then things in your serve didn't quite pan out.
it looked like after you lose those two games, lose the tiebreak, and then i think there was a backhand down the line, and then the racquet, let the racquet go. did you have to just kind of get it out and then you regrouped?
your thoughts on playing roger tomorrow. do you think that roger has kind of a comeback right now?
do you prefer to play him on a rather slow court like here or prefer to play on fast courts?
you played against roger a bunch of different times in both of your careers, either high or going through lower times. does it always feel the same presence across the net when it's roger, or does it depend a little bit on recent results?
when you are getting prepared to play roger, what is that sense like? are you just so hyper or anxious, or do you necessarily have to keep a lid on things and try and keep things on an even keel, either him or rafa or andy?
after a hardfought match like this, will you have any issues with recovering mentally or physically going into tomorrow's match with roger?
you have always had great success here, but we're not used to seeing you play a lot of threeset matches. you have had four out of five matches go three. what's your take on the way you're playing now? maybe struggles you're having we're not used to seeing you.
you could say in a way our sport is about big performances on big stages. can you reflect for a minute on sort of the art of big match play and go a little deeper in your preparations? is it a matter of ramping up or stepping back? how important are the xs and os? can you just focus on that, reflect on that, please.
yeah, and for slam finals.
yes.
in team sports in this country, especially in baseball, so much data is being used in terms of analyzing opponents. you were talking about what your team does analyzing. how much data do you use in terms of statistics, or do you just go by feel, how you're doing?
now with you and roger in the final, it's going to be 28 out of last 29 masters events won by one of the big four guys. what do you think that says about the importance you guys do place on these masters?
more tournaments keeping up with this one?
you served well the whole match, but seemed like in the tiebreakers, both of them, you shifted up another level. talk about your mentality going into these tiebreakers.
did you have a little bit of a mental checkout there going into the second set after winning that first tiebreak?
do you find that when you're finding your rhythm off the ground  forehand, backhand, hitting it big  that your serve actually gets bigger?
talking about the adrenaline, going for your serve there. over the years, what's that process like, you know, harnessing that? i'm sure you have gone through that as the years have gone on, harnessing, going for it full out, still getting those types of results.
you're back in the top 10. do you feel that it's almost a little bit, maybe coming later than you might have otherwise because you had those early injuries at wimbledon and australia that were big point opportunities, i guess. you have won i think like four titles over the last 12 months and couple more finals. seems a little overdue.
you had an injury earlier this year. at what point did you feel like you were going to be able to play at this level?
in your postmatch interview you said that even though you're in the top 10 you're not satisfied. is it time now to get you satisfied and take the next step?
what do you think about your success here on american hard courts? you beat him here and also cincinnati last year.
the match two years ago, going into this one, do you have to put that aside and start from scratch?
you're a singles player that dabbles in doubles, and you obviously did well here but you lost to the bryans. top two seeds are here. we have a lot of singles players in doubles. do you think the top teams would still be at the top if the singles players played more regularly doubles?
being a pro is tough, but it's also a pretty wonderful life, pretty wonderful experience. general question: what do you like best about being an atp pro? there is so much. the travel; there is always another tournament; the cycles every year. it starts with australia. what do you like the most?
if there was one fan experience where the fans really helped you that you really remember, marathon match, davis cup, what would it be?
john, given the fact that tomorrow's match is on espn, you're playing in the states, you are now in the top 10, does that put a little extra on you? i know every match is big, but it's an american deal. what do you feel about that?
you're frequently asked about this, but what's it like carrying the flag, you being the one american? is there a responsibility, or does it even cross your mind?
jose higueras of the usta had some harsh words speaking about the work ethic and i guess the complacency about some of the younger ranked american guys. do you think that's fair at all from what you see?
just getting back to the point about the top 10, when you say how tough it is to get in there, what was tougher for you: getting there the first time or getting back there the next time?
how do you think you can upgrade your performance in europe?
following up on my earlier question, you said you know which guys jos might be referring to. do you ever think about taking those guys aside and talking to them yourself?
top 10, jim courier said one of the things about being to the top 10 and top 5 is being ruthless in terms of managing your schedule. that's what he wanted you to work on. what's that mean to you? also, how do you feel about steve smith?
they have this college tournament this weekend, four men's college teams. can you kind of give your thoughts about what that's like, especially since you played in college and playing during the middle of a big pro tournament.
after kind of struggling the last couple matches dropping a couple sets, felt pretty straightforward. how did you feel it in general?
how important is this tournament to you, novak, given your start to the year? is this an important springboard for you for the rest of the upcoming month and the months to follow?
you have generally been pretty open to innovations. in terms of the paribas tournament here with all its innovations, the prize money, the attendance, how people just love it, do you think it's the fifth slam or do you think it should become the fifth slam?
you participated in the doubles here, as did other top singles players. at least this week we have no.1 and no.2 in the final. what does that say to you?
top two seeds in the men's doubles final.
some people says doubles players are singles players who couldn't make it.
couldn't make it as singles players so they become doubles players.
drawing you back to what larry ellison has done in tennis here, it might worry other people if they thought he might be able to take a more active role in the sport. what he's done in his business life, he's been phenomenally successful. do you think we should open doors to more people like that who have done well in the business world and see what they might be able to offer this sport, which, as you quite like to say, normally closes its doors to people with initiative and ambition.
do you think schedulingwise you would consider a good innovation they could come up with?
you're saying things about scheduling and all that. you made a point with the australian open and i fully appreciate where you're coming from on that but then you've also, i guess, got to look at what we're going through in, australia, the time of the year, what sponsors want, and all that. i guess it's a very difficult situation. you're not going to satisfy everybody.
i understand.
but then we've got the situation then you're saying about that break at the end, and then we've got the new pro league tennis league that wants to come into that slot. then you have players wanting to play that when they should necessarily be taking that break.
just your thoughts on the next match. isner won the first set. you've lost against him here. gulbis?
did you just run into the wrong guy today, or how do you assess it?
because of his return game?
what do you think about that crazy fifth game in the second set? it was such a roller coaster. somehow managed to find a way to pull that out. felt like the match was turning in your direction.
what's your takeaway from the tournament? it's still a very good result, and especially since you hadn't played in such a long period of time. you overall, do you have a good takeaway from it?
it seems like most games you come out in that first game and it's usually around 140 right away almost to set a tone. do you have like a plan a and plan b for your serve where you come out like that and someone is getting it back and you go to more variety in the way of serving? do you have a specific way you decide to serve before you come out?
you mentioned that serving 145, 141 you expected not such strong returns from him. he commented when he was in here that he thought he got to you by returning the opening serves like that, getting those 145s back. was it as big a factor as he thinks it was?
what was your reaction in the middle of that first set?
you're the only player in the top 6 who is left in this tournament, which is pretty unusual at a masters at the quarterfinal stage in this era where the top guys have been so reliable. do you sense a change of the mood of players? some players have cited stan winning australia as giving them more belief that it is possible.
seems like you have pulled out some matches here. how would you characterize your overall level in this tournament so far?
slightly different circumstances to the previous round when you admitted having a bit of a lapse in concentration.
but were you able to draw on the comeback ability from that match for tonight?
what about the next round? what are your thoughts there?
is there a belief system changing in the locker room that players that are pushing like you are, dolgopolov are starting to win those matches against the murrays and the nadals that maybe there weren't in the past?
is it actually a topic of discussion amongst you when you're in the locker room or player lounge areas, or is it more like a perception that you all feel that way?
so go just a little bit further. what's the feeling when you know before where you're not going to come through against roger or rafa or andy and now when you have a chance? can you describe what it's like within your mind?
can you say there is a changing of the guard?
the stan breakthrough, was that the impetus of that change, or is it about the other guys getting older as well?
how much better are you playing than you expected to play when the tournament started?
when he broke you in the third set, very first point in the next game you came in and put away a backhand volley. how important was that? it then leads to...
what do you think was the bigger factor in that third set? andy said he just played really poorly. do you think it was that or the way you remained focused and played your game?
you didn't have the tape on your leg and your ankle as you had in the other matches. is that because you're feeling better?
you spoke today on the court about this being the 20th anniversary of your parents emigrating from montenegro. can you speak to that immigrant experience and articulate what it means and how did you even know it was the 20th anniversary? did your parents speak of it?
okay.
what about alex next? you have a big serve and forehand; he has totally unorthodox game to face.
in addition to obviously staying healthy and in addition to just improving your game, what would you consider a successful year for you?
having got yourself into a pretty good position in the third set. breaking serve is obviously a very tricky punishment. what was your reading of how it kind of dribbled away at the end there?
what do you put that down to? just a bad day at the office?
so are you feeling a little low on confidence then?
is that because of maybe the matches you have lost this year or just the process of coming back?
you're coming back in a situation like this and you're playing matches  everyone has lulls  is it that the lulls are a little bit longer because you haven't sort of all the matches and confidence that you needed, or do you feel like you just haven't sort of hit your top form yet?
what do you think it is about this place that's made it a lot tougher for you than the other big north american hard court events?
you sound a little bit concerned. i don't know. i may be reading you wrong. you have talked about the process of coming back from the injury. do you feel like today was something different?
are you quite glad now that the next tournament you have is a place you know so well? you're familiar with the conditions. you have your own place there. are you quite glad that that's the next tournament you go to?
did you feel like you played well in this tournament overall, or did you feel like it was kind of patchy from start to finish?
looked like you came out with a very aggressive game plan against stan. is that a fair assessment?
were you paying close attention to his physical condition?
statistically looks like he's struggling with his first serve. did you notice that, or is there something you could pinpoint with his first serve?
is there something about the conditions here at indian wells that's different? because a lot of big servers are finding a lot of success and advancing: you, milos, isner.
there is only one guy in the top 6 left in this tournament, which is pretty unusual for a masters in this era of the atp where the guys are so consistent. do you feel there has been a change in the locker room? raonic was talking about guys like stan breaking through giving people more confidence that they can beat anybody. have you felt that?
can you talk about coming up next? you play the 7:00 match against the winner right now. if you get roger, that's kind of a tough double. what's it like to play tommy?
you knew how good stan was before he won australia, and now playing him after he wins australia, does that add a little bit of juice to it when you play a guy who has won a slam?
congratulations on your recent run. south africa has a longago tradition that's quite strong, but recently been struggling significantly. could you talk about that, please.
is ellis park functional now? is it a happening place? do you know whether there are courts in soweto that are any good?
when you have a win like this over stan, do you allow yourself to celebrate, or do you feel that, you know, it's one win and it's a type of win i feel i should be having?
do you still plan to apply for american citizenship?
when that happens, can you see yourself playing davis cup for america?
after struggling with your knee and elbow injuries a few years back, some have said that you're playing the best tennis you have played in your career. is it the physical being the better part, or is it just time, that your game is starting to come together?
it's the first time you played this guy, right? how long does it take you to usually figure this guy out, or did you ever figure him out?
the second game of the third set he had six game points before you got a break point.
are you thinking all along, this will settle it right here?
when you talk a little bit about a lapse in concentration in the second set, is that something you can point your finger to and why you lost maybe a little bit of focus?
as you probably already know, nadal had an early departure yesterday. what is your opinion, and what does that tell you about the level of competition in this round?
gonzlez is yet another player in his mid20s who suddenly from nowhere stepped up and proved he can play at this level. it's happening more and more. i know we talked about this.
as good a player as marin is and as tough an opponent as he is, surely the one positive is at least you know what to expect when you go in against him. both of you have been around for so long as compared to someone like today.
looking at this place, is there a fondness? i think it was '07 when you got here, went all the way to the final, and then went on to miami. this was kind of the beginning of something in '07. do you look back on that at all? it was a breakthrough for a lot of us relative to you.
do you have regrets?
is there anything you would like to change?
do you feel like you got tired as you went along and that maybe affected you?
from the inside of the court, what did you see from murray? did you think he was having an off day or wasn't 100% physically?
when you play a top 10 like him and you play such a tough match, do you feel like you're close in level? how does that make you feel?
did you feel that you had really in the crucial moments a selfbelief to seize control of the match, or did you still find yourself struggling with some doubts?
you seemed to have some fun. you missed some overheads but when you made one you put your arms up and the crowd really liked that.
are you playing davis cup against japan?
tomas and radek?
do you sense when a guy gets antsy about holding serve against you?
did you feel it today?
how did you feel physically?
is it hard to know when that groove is going to come back after a long absence? do you feel it in the practice court first or suddenly it starts to come?
did you like that final point of the first set?
how excited are you at the prospect of your next opponent?
andy hasn't been playing that well here, by his standards. down a break, got broken a lot today, and dropped sets first two rounds. do you notice those kind of things? do they make you go into that matchup any differently when you know a guy has been struggling early in earlier rounds?
what's gulbis like as a doubles partner?
nothing shareable, i imagine.
he hasn't poked you in the back with his outstretched arms when he's going for a forehand?
when you signed up for the doubles, did you expect to be playing three grand slam singles champions in the first two rounds? were you hoping for that, or why did you sign up for the doubles given the lack of match play?
i think it's tokyo, barcelona, and us open with andy. putting all those matches together, what sort of are your impressions of the rivalry?
that was not one of the prettier matches of your life i think it's probably fair to say. explain the frustration, i guess, of playing that way but still getting through it.
physically you called the trainer at one point. can you talk about what was going on there. generally, are you feeling a little restricted in any way physically from the back?
more generally anything?
you started off well; the first three games were super quick. was that frustrating then? you kind of let him back into it.
sometimes just to get sight of a new court and get the feel for it, is that a little difficult when you haven't played somewhere before?
you have a habit of coming back in matches when sometimes you're down and out. was that something you always felt has been in you since an early age?
he hasn't played, yet but if it's raonic, what's the challenge of playing him?
are you fairly comfortable returning his serve?
he's 20. you played dominic thiem as well in rotterdam. is it encouraging maybe seeing a couple of younger guys coming through? it's been a while since any kind of teenagers have made it.
was there a turning point in this match? there were so many momentum swings, breaks and break backs, missed overheads and things. seemed like they might swing the momentum one way or the other. but in the end, was it just all the way down to the end or something to let you know you might be okay today?
we have been talking the last couple of times about how the guys in the top are older now and they have been hanging around for longer. and for you specifically, now that you're a father, how is the tour and the tournaments changing to adapt do that? a lot of you guys have kids now.
have the tournaments had to adapt to that, too? say, if the children are coming onto the site?
can you give us an update on the racquet, how it's feeling, how it's playing?
do you have to adjust your string tension with it?
which way?
to what exactly?
tennis these days obviously is such a power game; there is also a lot of grace in the game. it's almost an art form, you could say. you have your beautiful onehanded backhand; your forehand has a lot of flow; you move with grace. could you just talk about the grace in the game, the beauty of the game, and sort of what for you is key? is it balance? the legs? the reflexes? the anticipation? just talk about that, please.
i'm talking about the grace of your game, the grace in tennis, whether you see it in part as a kind of thing of beauty or art form.
do you have a kind of pride in your onehanded backhand that you have such variety in it?
you had some fun out there with the pa guy on the court after the match. did you lose a lot of weight while you were out there in the desert shoveling?
is this court a little too slow for you?
no?
you won a lot on it and the speed apparently hasn't varied match. they redo it every year. over the years you don't think the speed has varied that much?
back to the earlier question about traveling with kids. how much tougher do you think it's going to be with another one to travel around with?
it's not twins again?
what did dubai do for your confidence in beating djokovic like you did in the final? i mean, was that a real sort of lift for you for the year?
after the match you signed the camera, roger federer is happy. besides winning the match, another reason? anything else going on?
what's the strangest thing the twins have said about your tennis?
they think it's normal their father is a tennis player?
do they play with your equipment, the racquets and balls?
good start. get a match under your belt. kind of getting back in your groove since the injury?
you've played well at this tournament before?
it's u.s., hard courts, so a lot of things that make you feel comfortable.
what's the level with the ankle? is there pain? no pain?
are you feeling any additional pressures as kind of the last standard bearer of men's u.s. tennis at the moment?
do you have any specific goals, john? are you focusing on certain tournaments or do you have a ranking goal?
it's not often that players get to play on new courts, especially as big as the one you played on today. can you talk about that experience?
obviously this is just incredible here, the ambience, everyone knows that. but also on court where you're always asked this, but you know what the results have been here and melbourne, sandiego, what the rankings are. you're the only one to reach a final last year. truth be told, do you think we're in crisis?
you have had enough injuries in your career, and even some freakish ones. as you get older is it easier or harder to put those behind you and get back to work? is it more or less frustrating as you get older?
it's pretty tough out there, but you have had a lot of good advisors, [] manny, mike, andy roddick, so forth. if you could point to maybe one piece of advice that's been really important for you in your career.
have you talked to hutchins at all?
as a fellow big server you had a chance to go up against cilic in delray, and he's had some career highs and serving stats. did you notice anything different how he's serving and how he's playing?
obviously a tough first opponent for you here out of the gates. what are your thoughts on the match?
few of the tops players already struggled here. is there something about the conditions here? hard to adjust with how the ball flies?
is it a disadvantage in any way to have a bye and then be up against a player that's had a match?
so will you stay here for a while to practice or go to miami?
this morning when you woke up and you hit and practiced and all that, did you get any sort of inkling or feeling that this was not going to be a good day the way you were hitting or anything like that?
did you serve your brains out today?
i mean, were you a little surprised not playing a while that it would be so good?
so how did the ankle hold up?
you were able to pull off some pretty big shots when you needed to.
how much were you hitting before you actually started to play points? for about how long were you actually hitting tennis balls?
were you being careful or were you actually still having...
when you went through that really erratic spell at the beginning of the third set, [] were you able to get it back together except for the serve?
what did it feel like when you saw that passing shot go by on the first point of the tiebreak?
he came in, hit a forehand down the line just to get the mini break, and then you were sort of on your way.
have you ever won a tiebreak without putting a first serve in so convincingly?
how are you feeling mentally right now? where would you rate your confidence?
at what point did you make the decision you were going to come and play here, and did you ever consider that it might be too soon and that you might not be ready? did you ever consider skipping it?
what have you been doing? i know high ankle sprains are probably worse than lower down. more difficult to treat and take longer to heal. what have you done for it?
how does it feel now after playing today?
falla?
what do you do in that time frame when you can't train, you can't hit balls? what do you do in an effort to maintain some sort of physical standard and fitness, and mentally, physically, all that sort of stuff?
started well. second set he had a couple match points. how did you see the match?
how are you feeling in general?
tough to come out after a loss. just in general, decent sort of run in australia, get some momentum, and it's kind of been patchy. just talk about your...
is that the big problem, loss of confidence and then trying to regain it? i mean, last year i know you didn't get to a final, and i just wonder if all that starts adding up over time.
what was david saying to you the last few weeks? what's he trying to get into your head?
did davis cup, has that lingered with you at all?
you have been a pro now eight years. i mean, it's hard to believe in a way, i guess, for you and for us. but do you ever say, i've had it or i'm going to keep plowing forward and keep trying to getting better? what goes through your head? i'm sure with athletes, we have dealt with them all, you get older and things go up and down.
what's the plan between now and miami? are you just going to take the time off?
when you're out there, do you feel like, you know, you're not able to sort of execute when you want to or you're not being aggressive enough? because obviously when you're playing aggressive you can be a really tough guy to beat.
that's really the critical issue there, on big points, obviously. i mean, it ain't any sport...
sometimes when you're struggling, when you get to that point where you start thinking about maybe making big changes, whether it's maybe style or personnel with your team, can you talk about that process? have you gone through that just kind of evaluating, you know, yourself, your team, what you should do and make, how you come to your decisions?
i thought you'd have a clippers hat on.
you have been on the tour a number of years. there are ups and downs. when do you pull up the bootstraps? you've got one more big tournament and then the clay court season, but how do you get yourself out of this feeling right now?
more generally.
(indiscernible.)
sam, dwyre took a big shot at american tennis players today, and you're one of the success stories. why aren't there more sam querreys in the united states?
did it ever bother you, the fact people kept expecting you as one of the next great american players? does that weigh on you?
how difficult is it to get into a rhythm against somebody who plays like that?
do you think of that when you're in this tournament and get down in a match, or are you able to set that aside and just focus on today?
you did well at this tournament, didn't you, at the start of your career, and then the last few years it's been a bit more of a struggle. is it somewhere you feel you might have done a bit better?
when he's thumping forehand winner after forehand winner, do you get the suspicion that in a minute they are going to start to fly not where he wants them to fly but you'll get yourself back into the groove again?
along with rafa, novak, and gal, you came out there and made a statement about the terrible situation over in ukraine. could you just talk about that and why did you decide to do it? just reflect on that.
you have a place in miami. you just played in the garden in newyork; here you're on the west coast; you won at the open; you spend a lot of time in this country. do you feel in a way that do you feel comfortable here in some way? is it a second home or is it just in and out of your life, so to speak?
another political question. obviously it's going to be an important year for scotland. i was just wondering if you've thought about how you're going to approach getting asked questions about the referendum and whether you plan to take a position?
obviously you're very popular; you've been popular for a long time. do you notice it when the crowd kind of gets behind you as they did in that match and you hear the, go, roger in the stands, when it's a critical point they start to make noise?
have you ever had a time where people rooted against you?
a couple of days ago when you were in here you said if you can't play for no.1 you'll play for titles and you feel good, you're healthy again. do you ever feel "old"? you look around, there are 18 year olds playing you, or does your body not feel the way it did five years ago?
when you knocked off sampras at wimbledon, sort of the match that pushed you forward, did you look around you and say, these old guys out there, the samprases and those, when you were 22 and 21, or did you just play the game, not think of the age?
you may not want to answer this...
the other day pete was talking about the role his wife bridget was playing and spoke very beautifully how it was really important having her in his camp, saying it doesn't matter what others thought, she was always there for him. could you talk about the role of mirka in your career?
it helped she was on the tour herself?
you know, roger, a couple years ago it was rare to see players over 30 playing, and especially playing at a high level. now you, as well as a couple others on tours, men and women, are playing very well after 30. is there something you see why there are more players playing at a high level after 30 right now?
you just used the word "special" when you reflected back on the early days. do you miss those days?
would you like those days still to be here now, or is it still as special now?
on your year or so on twitter, you have gotten very good at selfies.
if you could take a selfie with anybody, who would it be?
a quick followup to craig, when you're talking about managing expectations, are you talking about pre or dominant years, like before you won slams?
a question about stan. you are playing doubles here, spending a lot more time together than normal. has he been coming to you asking about how to manage expectations? and if so, what...
no enrollment in the roger federer school of success?
congratulations.
how much confidence does a performance and victory like this give you going into the aussie open?
did it surprise you a little bit how he started?
when he's misfiring like that, what do you do to try to keep him misfiring, i guess?
what does this title do for you, beating roger federer?
do you get any sort of benefit from the practice sessions with him?
after the last few years, how much does coming back and winning a title sort of mean to you? you seemed pretty emotional talking about it after the match.
what would be a good australian open for you? how do you set the bar?
the win today also, i'm pretty certain, will lift you above bernie. how much does the aussie no.1 ranking mean to you?
what was more satisfying: winning a title in australia at 16 or 32?
how satisfying is it at this stage of your career to still play matches against del potro, wawrinka, and now federer and beat them?
how would you rate roger's chances in melbourne?
what if you come up against one of those top three now that you've beat roger?
you got off to a slow start. talk us through the opening set.
how are you going physically after the week? you had doubles and singles this week.
you served very with the in the third apart from that one game. is that a concentration thing?
you said physically you feel good after the last couple months. formwise going into melbourne how do you feel?
how do you rate this match against lleyton compared to other matches you've played against him?
do you whether stefan watched that match? and what would you work with him about in melbourne?
what would be a good australian open for you? how do you set the bar?
you had no problem at all with your back today?
hasn't anyone told you you're supposed to be the old bloke?
have you ever played in tougher or hotter conditions?
do you think that worked to your advantage in the end, just that you're a bit more acclimatized to it than him perhaps?
the crowd was enormous. terrific atmosphere out there. being at home in the end help you as well?
roger is obviously up a set. talk about playing him again tomorrow in the final.
how important has your performance this week been as you head into the australian open?
was it a surprise that you had fight like that you?
is that a concern for you, the need to back up tomorrow?
as far as your rivalry goes with roger, there was a stretch where he got you a bunch matches in a row and you were able to break that in halle. when you have that kind of streak going, looking through the lens of serena and sharapova now, who beat her 14 straight times or something like that, when you do get the duck off, is it about more mental? is it a matchup thing? how did you see that skid ending for you?
if you had to give advice to sharapova for how to finally break through, what would that be?
he was saying he hasn't played you in a final in australia. how big is that for you to have a chance to raise a trophy after beating him on home soil?
(question regarding 2003 davis cup match.)
how fresh can you be tomorrow?
how did you feel after two matches, especially singles?
getting this many singles and doubles matches in the first week and getting to the singles final, how does it feel? pretty good with how your season is getting under way?
as far as the racquet goes, do you still feel any adjustment is needed, or like it's always been that way?
given the likelihood of a dogfight with lleyton, jeremy testing you and taking you to a third, even though you probably wouldn't want to be there on there with the heat, do you think that a good test for you heading into a match against hewitt?
how much are you looking forward to renewing your rivalry? are these the matches you look forward to?
is a match against him on australian soil a perfect buildup to the australian open?
looking back at your rivalry with lleyton, you won 15 straight against him. what do you remember about that stretch that kept it so in your favor so consistently? pretty remarkable run against a pretty top player.
if the australian open courts play like this one, is that a good result?
how brutal was the heat out there?
so the weather didn't affect your tennis at all, your mental concentration, because it was so hot?
how are the courts playing? there is a lot of talk that they are very fast this year. are you finding that the case?
how important was it to break him so early in the match?
if you play lleyton hewitt. you've only played once before despite obviously him being around the tour for such a long time. are your thoughts on that?
wimbledon.
how do you matchup with him in terms of game styles, do you think?
you took a little tumble on one of the shots and rolled over and got straight back up. you've had some injuries in the past.
do those tumbles bring back memories?
playing hewitt in these conditions here, is that a mental test for you, one you're comfortable with?
you had to retire last year in the semifinal. what would it mean to you to make a final in the first tournament of the year?
your one grand slam quarterfinal you made here in australia a couple years ago. do you think these conditions in australia and the courts give you the best chance of any of the four grand slams?
hot enough out there for you?
it looked like overall once you sort of settled in and sort of he worked out his game a little it went pretty well.
serves were coming through at 220 in the second set.
how long since you felt this good physically?
the benefit of the preseason i guess as well.
i know you've been on big stages before, but is it still exciting?
you played him before?
he said you played him in japan recently?
how was that?
cold?
what are your thoughts on his game?
did you feel like you're getting sort of just the right amount of match practice?
three australians in the quarters of tournament for the first time since '04. is that a sign of a revival?
do you talk to him about the mental side of his game?
you dug yourself a bit of a hole to start.
obviously one side of the draw has opened up slightly with gilles dropping out. can you dare to dream about beating roger in a final?
do you know much about him?
talk about satisfying wins in your career. in the last couple of years, how satisfying is today's win?
you looked like you've really slowed your play down a lot.
yeah.
you've played on courts all over the world. how fast are these hard courts compared to some on the other hardcourts you've played on?
as quick as arthur ashe stadium during its quickest days? that fast?
is that suits you pretty well. you like quick courts, no?
would you like the same speed in melbourne?
two matches in. how are you feeling physically?
rusty at all, or you feel yourself coming along as you would like?
you set yourself any specific goals?
just your general take on edberg and becker, coming back, bruguera, guys who played, coming into the coaching game. just your thoughts on that.
federer was saying he's a bit surprised to see becker back in. talk about djokovic though. he went undefeated at the end of the year, playing at a high level, and brings in another coach. why, in your opinion?
tomas berdych said, i played 600 matches and i never met anyone playing like novak tonight. what do you think of your performance?
did you expect to come out and play like this?
what happened on the first match point? it was too easy for you?
can i ask what you and tomas said to each other at the end?
would you rate it as your greatestever performance over bestofthree rather than bestoffive match?
at what point in today's match did you start to realize that everything was firing on all cylinders? does that happen in warmups, first set, second set?
you're the no.1 player. you won the tournament five times. you have a beautiful wedding. you will be a father. can life be any better?
you shared your language skill tonight again. we wonder if you really know what it means.
pretty lady, why do you want to learn that?
yesterday i asked you how about changing china open to nole open. what is your feeling right now and what does this title mean to you?
always playing great tennis all these years in beijing. do you feel like china open is the ultimate challenge for other players to try to beat you here? everyone wants to beat rafa at the french.
you have five china open titles. i think you are even more popular than our home favorite li na. do you have any words for her?
yes.
you've spoken a lot about the chinese fans this week. what is it like for you being a guy from serbia in china, to see all these specifically chinese fans holding up flags and signs?
as for the support of chinese fans, in your eyes why do they love you? because of your personality or some characteristics?
the first 11 games must have been tough to take. can we check your fitness is okay? you're not injured or anything like that?
was that the best anyone has ever played against you?
near the end of the match it looked like you were trying to give your racquet to the ball girl. what was going through your mind at that moment?
your serve was broken six times tonight. it's been broken once before tonight in the entire tournament. what was novak able to do on your serve?
i think a lot of people will have admired the way that you kept on right till the end. did you feel you were determined to win at least one game?
on something different. there were stories after the us open about you stressing a desire that you would like lendl to not necessarily coach you but work with you a little bit, offer you some advice. have any conversations taken place between the two of you to that effect?
a lot of people were expecting you and rafael nadal to meet in the final, but he lost last night. do you have any comments on that? were you surprised by the result?
i think that's six wins out of seven against andy. do you feel that you've got any sort of psychological edge over him at the moment?
andy was saying that it's quite a unique atmosphere here, and the ball gets very, very heavy. he thinks it might be something to do with the pollution. clearly it's not a problem for you. do you find it different to elsewhere?
i'd like to know what is the most exciting thing for you, to try to become no.1 to try to keep this ranking?
as you said, andy went ahead 43 in the second set, seemed to be gaining momentum. you snuffed out that resistance and closed it out.
after a few matches here after a long break, how do you rate your form compared to where it was at the us open? hitting the ball better, moving, how do you rate it?
you have won four titles here and potentially maybe the fifth one will be under your belt. can the china open be named as the nole open now? what is your opinion?
in the second set for a short period of time you struggled a little bit. you fiddled with your racquet. is this a good way for you to get rid of the pressure?
after this match you chose to write 'love' in a chinese character on the screen. do you know this character, what it means? why did you choose this chinese character? did you think about naming your baby with a chinese name?
what do you think it is about klizan that gave nadal so much trouble and also gave you a battle, as well?
what are your initial reactions to your matchup with djokovic in the final tomorrow?
what were you thinking in the second game of the first set when martin fell down? what were your initial reactions to that?
i see that you got a wechat public account and sent three or four voice messages to the chinese fans. it seems like you are looking to coming to china to play your match. do you feel the support from the chinese fans?
in 2011 you won the title, defeating cilic. cilic won the us open final. you made it into the finals of grand slams. cilic won a grand slam title. is this a motivation for you? is it still your dream to win a grand slam title?
just now you said in china you have many fans. at the china open, djokovic has more fans. it is the home field for djokovic. tomorrow what is your feeling about the competition with him?
cilic won the us open because of the assistance of his coach. will you use his approach to improve yourself? we know that djokovic never failed at the china open. as for tomorrow, are you wellprepared for tomorrow's competition, so tomorrow you can play as well as your performance, just like this competition?
how is the wrist? do you think it affected the match at all?
the wrist injury.
you don't think it affected the match at all?
what was the difference tonight playing against martin? you've beaten him twice before. was it the long time away from the court that affected your play or did he just play that well?
what would you be happy with at the end of the season? would it be just being fit and healthy, having played a few matches?
is that the reason you decided not to play the tennis premiere league, was to have more time to practice before australia?
you decided not to play the iptl.
rafa, did you find that once the roof closed, did that have any effect on the match at all?
in your career you've had three or four times when you have been out for several months. does it become easier or more difficult to come back after that?
after you've been out injured for a long time.
uncle toni was saying he chose to walk away as your coach even before you have retired. is that something you have discussed with him?
uncle toni said he may choose to walk away as a coach before you retire because he has a life to live. he thinks it's too much for him to handle the travelling. is that something you have discussed with him?
he considered it.
i just read from some reports that he was saying that. you have no idea about this?
klizan in last year's french open and wimbledon this year got one set from you. today he got two sets from you and won the match. from your perspective, what kind of changes have you noticed in him so that he could win the match? do you think lefthanders pose more challenges to you than the righthanders?
when we were watching the match, we thought you had a lot of errors on your forehand, that your forehand condition is worse than your opponent's. do you think the forehand was a major cause to the result today or any other reasons to explain the loss today?
just give us your verdict on the match. very good win for you.
last sunday was your first title since winning wimbledon. this was your biggest ranking win since beating novak in the final. was it the best match you played since then?
do you think that consistency and momentum will be key tomorrow to beating novak? how do you feel about that match going in?
you said this match may not have been the best match you played, that you played well in other ones. but is this couple of weeks the best stretch of form you've had since wimbledon last year, or is that too microscopic of a view?
the victory in shenzhen last week, does it mean your cooperation with amlie mauresmo is more efficient?
in the first set, how big was it for you to not give up the break in your second service game?
i noticed you threw your racquet on the second set.
what was your feeling at that moment? does it help you a little bit?
there's been a lot of talk this year about the young players coming through. dimitrov is obviously a part of that group. what is your feeling? is there still a gap between the younger players and the big four? second set he had some chances, breaking you twice, but didn't capitalize. is there still a psychological gap that players like him need to learn?
your book is just published in chinese. chinese people who like spicy and oily food, do you think they can accept your diet?
stan said over the summer that after winning the australian open he felt like he had put the puzzle back together, figure out what's going on in his head. cilic is a firsttime winner as well. when you won the australian open back in 2008, can you relate to what stan is saying in terms of the puzzle, or was your perspective after that win actually different?
you could face andy murray in the next round. you haven't met him since that epic quarterfinal match you played against him in new york. explain how your strategy might be going into this game.
you'll be playing again in asia at the end of the year. will you be traveling to india? if so, can you talk about playing in india.
after the match you wrote a chinese character. when did you know how to write this chinese character? as for future matches, will you write some other chinese characters?
in china, you have a lot of fans here. actually, in china you got the unbelievable victories in beijing and shanghai. how do you get those victories in china and what do you want to say to the chinese fans?
there were 22 deuce points in the match. why do you think it was so tough for you and your opponent to win on deuce points?
you've been through two matches already here. what, in your opinion, is working well and what's not working so well after your threemonth break?
in the previous match you said you hoped that your doubles match will help you a little bit. do you think it contributed to your singles victory?
what exactly is wrong with the ball? too fast? too slow? too heavy?
just on the different balls. there are different balls obviously used at different tournaments. there have been a few players with wrist injuries. does that play a part in that?
this week, does that make you feel more nervous when you play?
just now you were named as the most dynamic player for 2014. winning this award, what is your feeling?
two days ago you attended li na's retirement ceremony. we know that you participated in a lot of players' retirement ceremonies. this occasion, you gave the flowers to li na. what is your feeling on that day?
yesterday you met the football coach of guo an. he gave you the suit of guo an. will you be there to watch the football game? did you know this beijing football team? did you meet this coach before?
you played cuevas once before back in 2007. how much of your past experience did you factor into this game?
do you feel any different being at this tournament on a winning streak from last week? does it feel like the weight has been lifted or does it just feel like another tournament?
you played six matches in the past eight days. how do you feel physically? also, can you talk about your next match with cilic.
rafa came in here earlier and was unhappy about the ball that's being used at this tournament. do you also have problems with the balls? he said other players have been complaining about it.
what were your thoughts on cilic's run at the us open, then thoughts going into tomorrow's match?
the first round in beijing you were losing 15 to janowicz, then you lost in the tiebreak. today is a big win. what triggered the change in your form? is it because your opponent has changed?
it's your first time to play on the center court. i noticed before you serve you look at the sky. is it because of the light or is there some other reason?
as for the past asian games, you chose tokyo. this year you chose the china open. what are your different feelings towards these two competitions in asia?
the fifth game in the second set, you looked a little bit under the weather, were broken by your opponent. right now are you feeling well? will it affect your next round's competition?
you dominated serve all match, only giving up three points on serve in the first set. in the second set when you were broken, what changed at that moment?
you talked a couple days ago about how you're fighting for the no.1 ranking at the end of the season. talk more about what it would mean to you to finish no.1 for the third year in the last four years. how important is that to you?
do you think it's lucky to play a match in the center court when other players' matches are suspended because of the rain?
in the second set your opponent had a set point. later you had a breakpoint and made it. do you think this is the difference between the top players and others?
you're 210 all time at the china open. is there any added pressure having a winning streak like that here?
as for the next round, what are your expectations? do you see it as a tough game?
how did the wrist feel out there today?
how do you think you served today?
in years past the asian swing has not been your favorite time of year. you've talked about running out of steam in the past. do you find coming back after such a long layoff that you have more energy and feel more refreshed than you normally do?
how did it feel to see all the 'rafa' and 'vamos" signs in support of you?
you broke your opponent once in the first set, but three times in the second. what was the difference between the two sets?
how much were you following the us open at all? what was your reaction to seeing marin and kei in the final? was the result surprising to you?
my friend is in spain, your hometown, in the tennis academy. he told me that mr. sergio, he worked with him. previously you did training with a young chinese tennis player. as for coming back to the asian season, what is your suggestion for the young chinese tennis players?
on the first day you asked the workers where you can see the football game. did you see the football game that night?
your answer is too simple. how did you watch that game? on the internet or on the tv?
so your last two service games were incredibly dominant. was there something that clicked in your head as you got close to the end of the match?
starting the match, he took you to breakpoint on your first two service games. were you expecting him to play well at the beginning?
obviously it feels a little bit different coming into a tournament as a grand slam champion. can you talk about the different feeling you have now, a lot of attention on you, more expectations on you.
it looked like you had a pretty good time back home in croatia celebrating the us open title. did you also have an opportunity to sit quietly and reflect, or was it just a whirlwind couple of weeks since davis cup?
you had four birthday cakes yesterday. you celebrated very late. you were still awake at midnight. a birthday is always nice, but do you have to remind yourself that you have a very important tournament to play and focus?
winning a grand slam changes people regardless of whether they want it to or not. in what ways do you want it to change you and in what ways do you not want it to change you?
one week ago you came to beijing. over the past week what did you do in beijing?
what were your thoughts before the game about facing the us open champion?
did the fan support help you on the court with everybody cheering you on?
how were you able to fight off so many breakpoints against cilic?
you started off well. you went serve for serve with the us open champ for the first six games. then cilic won the next three. what changed in that first set?
you almost broke cilic a few times, but you came up 04. why weren't you able to be successful on those breakpoints?
as for this match, did you play your best?
several years ago in shanghai you played andy murray. this time you played cilic, although you lost. compared to that match in shanghai several years ago, what is the change?
can you tell us about your coach and your plans for the future.
you train yourself?
you are seen as a talented tennis player right now. you are 25 years old. how about your body condition? what is your goal and dream?
what is your dream?
yesterday i interviewed cilic. he knew you quite well. maybe you have some interpersonal relationship.
do you have any regret in your professional career, maybe you could have done better, because of injuries or...
a set down and a break down. how did you turn it around? terrific end.
why was it so tough?
when was the last time you remember playing two matches like this where you had to fight back to back, fight to get that win?
you trained extremely well this year compared to last year. what role does your racquet play now, the good results you have had?
you played attacking tennis this week so successfully, presumably because the courts are fast. how much do you hope the other courts speed up a bit?
is it perhaps more the case that yesterday you showed your tennis is getting to where you want it to be but tonight mentally you're in a good place too?
just looking ahead, i believe last year it was perceived that you were too inactive in a stretch coming up, and therefore
as in not playing, not playing in competitions, australia coming up, over in the states. and therefore you weren't match hardened enough for that stretch and it had an effect on the rest of the season maybe.
is that a valid assessment?
no, it's not. okay. and are you happy with this year's schedule in that regard?
don't take it the wrong way, but my colleagues did mention that you're coming back. does roger federer think that he's coming back as a 2.0 or are we seeing the rise of a roger federer as dominating world tennis again?
can you talk a little about tomas, you know, how difficult is it to put away a loss, like two days, how long does it generally take for a top player? how good can he be this year?
you almost really had that match. a set up, a break up in the second, 32. what actually went wrong?
so what's the difference, this highestofever levels, between winning and losing?
is that one of his better traits? he just never seems to get discouraged in a match?
roger never seems to get discouraged in a match even if he's down.
a lot of players get a little bit more discouraged.
how do you review the whole week? still been a good week for you.
how hard is it to put a loss like this behind you? how long will it take for you to recover from something like this?
do you prefer a slower court when you play against roger?
how difficult is it to keep your concentration when the crowd are getting so involved in the points? i think there were a couple of times where there were "out" calls that you seemed to be quite distracted by.
what are the positives you are taking from this week?
with the form that you carry, how important is davis cup for you?
you played a very fine match apart from the end of each set. what happened?
a very good week overall for you?
what are the positives you take from this week? i mean, you have been playing consistent.
you have been ambitious. now perhaps you can be a better player, a better...
you said yesterday that you'd have to play differently against berdych or tsonga. do you feel as if that's the way you should play against power players in the future, how you played tonight?
for a small guy
how difficult is it? what's the extra work that you have to put in to sort of match the bigger guys?
do you have any specific ranking goal for this year?
how big an ambition is it for you to win or advance in the davis cup as well? because you've got a tough tie coming up there.
you have kept your positive record against novak now. among your three main rivals, he's the only one you have a positive rivalry against. what do you think is the main reason? his playing style suits you more?
saving that break point halfway through the second set was crucial, wasn't it?
a good fist pump after that.
overall, how did you turn the match around? a set down, and then the second set was close, love30 on novak's serve. then the rain came. then you really started to play terrific.
before the tournament you said you're feeling your best tennis is right around the corner. how close are you, do you think, to that?
by the end of january we have a new grand slam champion. by the end of february, novak hasn't won any title.
plus obviously you're playing fantastic. do you have the feeling 2014 could be your very interesting and a little bit strange year in men's tennis?
tomas said earlier that he'd rather play you in the final, obviously because he thinks he can beat you.
he's obviously going into the final with confidence. what are your thoughts? he's beaten you here.
boris was plainly there tonight. i'm just wondering if you've spoken to stefan tonight, when you're linking up next, whether there has been any dialogue this week. because that second and third set was the aggressive style that stefan wants you to play.
i wanted to ask about the same thing of berdych. you have been coming here for more than ten years and you have a home base. have you picked up on the arabic language?
not yet?
the fans seem to be on your side. did you feel that when you were playing?
i asked you the other night what you think about when you sit in your courtside chair, and you talk about all your many languages. when you're sitting in that courtside chair and you're telling yourself, roger, come on, focus, do this, are you telling yourself in swissgerman, german, english, or french?
there are suitable words in swissgerman?
he doesn't play much better than that, does he?
was there a reason for that, novak? because you were a set and a half up, in a sense, playing quite well. you seemed to be playing quite will. that rain delay came. did that break your focus?
are you comfortable playing on these fast courts?
is there an interruption in your rhythm when you miss a match like yesterday because of youzhny? did that affect you at all?
roger has won here five times. he is very much a home favorite. you have played him in switzerland. could you compare the crowds in terms of how much support roger gets?
i'm sure it's difficult to say this right after a loss, but what positives come out of the week? especially coming in you said you were just looking for match play.
what do you enjoy about being here?
you played a lot to his backhand, as people do. did you notice any difference in the way he was playing it now with the new racquet? i think it's the first time you have played him when he's had the new one.
how do you feel you played the match tonight mentally?
you have been working with boris for a few months now. how are you working together to improve your game? what have you improved in these past few months?
so far, there's a couple of titles that you weren't able to defend. do you look at each match in an isolated way, or are you sensing something bigger in the first couple of months of the year?
nice feeling to be in the semifinals?
what was the key for you today? jaziri seemed a bit fatigued or tired.
the prospect of your semifinal opponent, berdych or tsonga, what do you make of that?
your 300th win today.
you have been remarkably consistent here. have you got fresh targets for this year and beyond?
a question about stats. last week atp ranking, 8 of top 20 are onehanded back handers. do you think onehanded back handers are coming back?
just your thoughts about the game?
you must be quite proud to have gone this far. in the history of the tournament, i think only four arab tennis players have got this far. are you quite proud, despite having gone out, with your achievement here?
how do you feel now after this result? how are you looking forward for the next tournament? you must be proud of yourself, as my colleague said. few arabic players have got to this stage.
what can you say about your opponent today, kohlschreiber, about his style of play? and where you think he...
it looked like you were holding your wrist. was there a wrist problem or just dizziness?
after the first two games, was it as easy as it looked?
the mood of that match tonight could hardly have been more different than the mood yesterday. is that a relief or is it something that, you know, you had hoped would happen?
tomorrow obviously novak. just wondering, from your experience he obviously didn't play a match today. is that an advantage to him, disadvantage, doesn't really matter?
the rankings seem now to suggest otherwise, but does the big 4 still exist?
nadal is playing the south american tour right now. a couple days ago novak said he would definitely play the south american tour as well. will you play the south american tour any time soon? you were in argentina in 2012 and you seemed to have a great time there.
he was going to play buenos aires, but...
do you get more pleasure or maybe satisfaction from a match like tonight's where things were going well or like yesterday's where you've got a lot of problems to solve?
i'm wanting your view to clarify your view on the international tennis premier league and what, if any, reservations you have about it?
yeah.
just returning to the match tomorrow night against novak, you've played so many times, 31, because i checked it.
do you look upon it as one of the great challenges for you?
congratulations. you fired back twice in that second set, didn't you, from a break down?
what makes someone who is in mexico at the time accept a wildcard for a tournament in dubai? that's a long jump to make.
your serve helped you a lot yesterday and today when you were down a break point and you came up these big aces. you must be happy with your serving. have you been doing anything differently lately?
your first quarterfinals in an atp event since moscow, if i'm not mistaken?
how do you explain getting back to this kind of level?
next you play either seppi or kohlschreiber. can you just talk about each one separately and what you can expect.
roger, well done. how did you find a way to win the match after it looked a little bit dicey at the start of the third set?
when you're sitting in a courtside chair in between the breaks, throughout your career you seem very composed, very analytical. are you? or is your mind racing and are you annoyed and just don't show it?
when i sit there, i feel the music in the bar outside the stadium quite loud, but when you are really focused on the court, it's like you cannot hear the music at all?
the fans, when the chips are down, the boisterous noise, i mean, is that noise or encouragement for you?
what happened at 52 in the third set, the double faults?
no, in the third set when you were serving for the match at 52.
lack of concentration?
i have a question about your forehand technique. i'm not sure this is the right place to ask such a question.
what exactly is your forehand grip? some people say it's eastern and some say it's semiwestern.
do you change your grip based on the surface you played last?
into the quarterfinals, you're going to play the czech, lukas rosol. how do you look upon that match?
congratulations. how do you focus throughout the match when it seems like you're winning quite comfortably?
when you get broken when you're serving for a match, how much do you read into that? and is it more a lapse in focus from you or more your opponent just...
you've spent some time now with boris. can you give us a little idea how his coaching style might differ from marian's?
but how is he different? how does he give you a message that might be different?
how matchsharp do you feel ahead of the quarterfinals? youzhny quarters, federer semis, berdych/tsonga final. how matchsharp do you feel?
dubai might be the only tour event that a player comes straight in after the match. obviously we like it.
i'm asking your opinion. do you like this arrangement?
the color of his tshirt is exactly the same color as the ball, roberto's shirt today. and also tsonga's this morning. is it ever difficult to see the ball when playing them? it sounds like a pretty good strategy.
into the quarterfinals, a match against the russian, mikhail youzhny. you have a good record against him and you beat him twice last year.
what do you think about the itpl concept, the international tennis league?
you looked very confident.
semifinal in melbourne and the title in rotterdam. now you're in the quarterfinal here. do you think it's the best start of the season in your career?
do you think you're playing better now than you were when you made the final here last year?
you have been to semifinals in all four grand slams. it shows you can play in all surfaces. which one do you think you have the biggest hope to actually win it?
you play tsonga in the next matchup. what do you think about that matchup?
how much of your focus is on converting those semifinal appearances into finals and the finals into wins?
what do you think about itpl?
have you signed up for it? have you actually signed up for the premier league?
you saved five match points. how crazy was that? how nervewracking was it for you?
this is like your fourth match this month that you have won 76 in the third. have you realized that?
did you sense that his body language like started getting very negative in the end? did you feel he was tired? because he wasn't playing very well in the end. did you sense that or were you focused on your game and your serves?
today you are a surprise, and the indian player, samdev. you're going to face the new player, another surprise player. how do you feel?
my colleague wants you to speak about the state of arab tennis right now and do you think enough development is being done? and what can be done to get more players in the top since you're the topranked one?
you are seventh arab players, and you go for round 2. how do you see this situation? since 2009 you didn't have any top ranking arab player.
that was a nice comfortable start to the tournament for you.
playing a night match in front of quite a big crowd and an opponent who is good but not too good, was that ideal, get the desire going?
you get to play roberto bautista. last year he made you work for it a bit in the second set.
you said on court that you feel your game isn't where you want it to be, so what else would you be working on?
that break is quite a long break, isn't it?
is there any way in which there is some kind of catharsis or reassessment of what you've got to do?
would you ever consider going to the south american tour?
novak, there are a few traditions happening here annually, the cake cutting with the winning and the belly dancer, and there was this funny video with you last year. are you still going to be belly dancing tonight?
how does it feel? i know it would have been good to finish the match.
you were probably aware that he was having this problem before. is it hard to play...
you didn't know?
you have been playing really well of late. you won the challenger last week. talk about what's going on, how come it's all coming together.
at what point did you figure the wrist, that he was not hitting his backhands?
you played the set points really well. can you remember them and talk through them?
did you feel you had nothing to lose, or...
(question aboutcoming to the net.)
does it feel like home ground here?
a tight match in some ways.
how would you write that performance? 5 out of 10? 7? 9?
so what you're saying is you don't want to peak too early? you want to save yourself until later in the week?
when you've got a pretty good streak going, does it put any pressure on you to keep the streak going or does it give you added confidence?
i don't want to jinx you, but have you been looking at your service stats of the year so far? even this match? you're doing exceptionally well.
next week in hong kong, how important is it for you to be there? more so because you are davis cup champions.
i was referring to the itf world tennis, your involvement with the world tennis thing.
the court seemed to be playing quite fast. does that encourage you to come to the net more often? is that a part of your game you have been working on or would like to work on?
how tough was it playing that match in such terrific heat?
well, it's pretty hot.
i was. still pretty hot.
it took you a while to break him down. then you kind of took over, didn't you?
are you happy with the way you played?
second round you could face either rosol or brands. what do you make of those opponents?
i think both you and daniel reached the quarterfinals last year. does that prove that you, you know, you both have
well, you both can play well in these conditions.
are the courts' conditions very different from last year?
what do you like about being here?
is it too early to sort of think about the quarterfinals prospect with federer?
seemed to be a nice way to ease into the tournament.
the hotdog in the second set, it's a shot that probably anyone in this room would do a nasty injury to himself. you made it look pretty effortless. talk us through that. must have been a lot of fun.
how difficult is it to win matches when most times you're expected to win matches?
you have had a few first rounds here in the past that were a bit shaky. you must be pleased with how well you've done, and also you told us you were feeling very strong coming into this.
you just said you're taking it round by round. have you given any thought at all to a potential semifinal showdown with another guy who has done pretty well here?
russell or stepanek.
pete sampras has recently come out and said that you can break his record at wimbledon and play for another four years. what is your reaction to that?
you talked yesterday about being really comfortable with your new racquet. is there a particular shot that it's improved especially, or was it just increased confidence, you go for your shots generally?
you're living in your home here. you've got family here. your dad is here. is the federer timetable, during the course of the day when you have a night match, any different to when you're in a hotel at a regular tournament?
because you have moved into a hotel for the tournament here before.
what is your analysis of that match?
he made a lot of unforced errors but had a lot of winners. is the aggressive approach difficult for you?
although you did not reach the final, you must be happy with the results. you beat rafa; played great tennis yesterday.
in this moment?
wawrinka never won this tournament. do you think he can?
good to be back in the final six years later. novak maybe not at his best today with the injury...
you said you didn't know exactly what novak had, but he had the brace.
you couldn't understand from the way he was playing if it was his serve or forehand, there was no chance to understand?
about this swiss final, what is your comment on that? what do you remember of the match that you lost to wawrinka? you lost to him in montecarlo, but you were coming up to some important moments.
about the match you played with him?
you said you were a bit surprised to reach the final. you accepted the wild card invitation. does that mean you're pleasantly surprised at your level?
how do you see the match tomorrow against stan?
you played 14 times against stan, but it's the first time you'll be playing him in a final. for him it's going to be his first masters 1000, if he wins it. for you, if you win it, it's going to be the first time here in montecarlo. it's going to be a special match for both of you.
what about severin? he's in the middle of you two.
if you win tomorrow, the only tournament left that you haven't won yet is rome. what can you do to win it?
were you surprised the crowd was cheering for you, although novak lives here, it's his home in a way?
tomorrow the final will be at 3:00. what is your schedule in the morning?
the first set you tried. the second set it seemed you couldn't do much more. what was going on for you?
knowing all the problems that players have had with their wrist, what is your idea now about what to do? take a rest? wait for a big event when you're really ready?
did you consider pulling out at any stage during the match, worrying you would make it worse by continuing?
did the pain kick in only today or was it there in the last couple days and you didn't want to let us know?
trying to be precise, can we write or say it is a tendonitis or is it something else?
this problem you have, is it the first time you have it in your career?
do you feel it's connected with the hard courts or some certain moment?
you said before you don't want to withdraw and don't play this tournament. do you think this is the strength of your character, of your personality? at the same time, it's your bad part? in the past, with the ankle, you play with the ankle because you have to play again and again and again. what about this part of your personality?
about the injury itself. do you remember how you first noticed it? was it in training, during a match?
can you explain what happened? was it a bad day for you? just a great day for him? how do you feel in general after this match?
does losing here hurt more than losing at another tournament to you?
you had 44 unforced errors today. it's very unusual for you. what reason do you see behind all those mistakes you had?
you mentioned about confidence inside. is there a problem with your confidence? is there something that's maybe affecting your confidence? you were 41 against gabashvili.
a player like ferrer, he doesn't give you anything. he fights for every point. it's very hard to stay in every point and find the intensity?
did david surprise you in some way with something he did, something which was new or strange that he did this match?
regarding confidence, is what happened in australia still in the back of your mind?
what is your state of mind right now? is it more frustration, anger, doubting, surprise?
you won so many things, so many important matches in your career. in your personal ranking, this match, which level is it?
is it special because you beat rafa? you had so many battles against him.
is that in the back of your mind when you play someone and you beat him only 10 years ago?
there was a moment in history to beat sampras on grass in wimbledon was the biggest upset, then it was to beat federer on grass. to beat nadal on clay is the biggest upset that can happen today in the tennis world?
which is the biggest upset?
for you what was the key of the match?
rafael said he was unable to find his intensity. did you sense he was not at his highest level?
what will be the keys against wawrinka tomorrow?
last year you were two points from winning him, then in rome. today were you thinking, i must be careful, or you were not thinking at all?
your control now of your words or sensation is because you have to play another match or were you jumping in the locker room?
you must be happy with the way you got through that. two points from defeat. get out of jail, so to speak.
what sort of explanation do you give to yourself when you are on court and you miss all those breakpoints? do you get more and more nervous?
tsonga was saying the conditions changing seemed to favor you more in the third set, to which stan responded with a sarcastic message on twitter. what do you make of that, that supposedly the conditions suited you?
you're a very confident player. were you surprised the way the third set went? you kept your focus and confidence. you just kept winning games.
it's obviously frustrating when you have all those breakpoint chances. were you happy with your composure? you didn't let it show it was getting to you.
coming back into that match, does it show the confidence you have gotten recently?
this is your fourth time in the semifinals. what does that mean for you to be in the semis of your first clay court tournament of the year?
two swiss players are in the semis here. this shows that swiss tennis is experiencing a very good period.
what do you think of the semifinal coming up, either novak or garcialpez?
today it wasn't a very tough match for you. do you prefer before going into the quarterfinals a match like this or would you have preferred a match which is more challenging, or you don't care?
you played against david many times. what will be the key?
are you satisfied with the sensations you're having on court?
you were playing well, then 41. do you think it was more physical than mental?
you said you stopped moving with your legs.
today fognini completely lost a match which he should have won. when is the last time you had the feeling in your personal situation that you were able to manage the situation with your mind, with your nerves? how difficult is it and how can you be able to control your nerves?
did you enjoy yesterday? do you think ancelotti is better than mourinho?
what do you think of fognini's behavior on court?
the match seemed to get away from you at the end. you seemed to have a problem controlling your emotions. can you talk about that.
do you regret that, that you lost control of your emotions?
how would you judge your game today? it started off a little bit difficult but then got smooth.
how special is it for you to be here after not playing here the last few years?
you played tsonga many times, different surfaces. are you looking forward to the match tomorrow?
do you see him as an inconsistent player? he lost to a 112thranked player in davis cup recently. he's a grand slam finalist. do you see him as a bit inconsistent?
did you follow the match between jo and fognini? what do you think about it?
the question was rather about fabio's behavior.
you're saying that the game now does not allow players to show some strong personality and be good at the same time?
you played 15 times against jo. you are far ahead in the headtohead. last time was on clay in the french open. do you feel vulnerable right now?
your impressions of this first match? the start was maybe a little bit slow.
are you still struggling with the 20, 25 seconds between points? is that something that annoys you?
you faced four breakpoints in consecutive service games in the second set. are you unhappy with your serve today?
have you any thoughts on roger federer deciding to play here?
the time violation, is it still a topic among players? are you trying to make this change or...
if i were to ask you to bet today who would end their career with more grand slam championships, nadal or federer, who would you bet?
1713
200?
why?
how about 1 million?
of course, you played a claycourt specialist. are you disappointed by the point in the first set and do you believe you played good tennis and it's a good sign?
today the conditions were not good for aggressive players.
what is your schedule now?
can you say a few words about tsonga tomorrow. do you think you will be the favorite?
why do you think you lost twice against him?
do you expect the crowd to be for you or for him?
52 minutes. pretty good first match for you.
i do not know if it's true or not, but apparently your tennis scheduling depends on some possible birth in the next month. is that true? you may go to rome or paris depending on that, or it has nothing to do with that?
will it change?
would that include a grand slam if it happened then? you'd pull out?
can you talk about your next czech opponent, rosol.
one question that is even more difficult to answer. in six months you have to play davis cup against italy. can you elaborate a bit what that means that you're back in the davis cup, if there is any expectation bigger in switzerland because of that?
if you play italy, what that means for you.
place and surface, could be basel on grass?
why did you add this tournament to your schedule? how was it for the first match on clay?
so the transition to clay was not a problem?
you are now at your best level physically again. did you think you could play that well?
you almost made it at the end, but you ended up losing that final set. what happened? you seemed to do okay in the beginning of the match.
why did you miss those returns in the last game?
why were you serving so badly today?
obviously you're not happy with the beginning of the season.
this year you added casablanca. what will be your schedule now?
so what are you going to do next?
how did the match feel today?
i know you're a football fan. do you remember the last time you won a match in 45 minutes?
can you tell us what happened to your right wrist?
do you enjoy your rivalry with rafa as much as the fans do?
and it's fun?
can you talk a bit more about the wrist injury, how it started?
do you still have time also and the pleasure to enjoy off the court? i saw you on tv in italy. here normally you participate for the player party. do you still like to do that or is it more fatiguing and you're trying to stay out of all the action outside the tennis court?
will you sing or dance this week?
you said two days ago, and rafa said, it is difficult to find out how to beat you on clay. where do you go? forehand? no. backhand? no. movement? no. at the same time how can you explain that you win seven times in a row, he wins three times in a row? as you said, yes, you learn from something. how and what do you learn? seven times in a row, why do you beat him? why are you beating him so many times?
what did you expect from him? he had surgery. did you have any information about his level of game right now?
like the other players who were in the davis cup tie, you didn't have much time to prepare. are you pleased with this result?
what do you think about robredo next round?
you beat him in rome once.
is he the worst?
what is the dominant feeling after this match? you fought a lot.
do you think about your knee when you're playing?
what are you going to do now?
mentally how do you feel?
can you describe the rivalry between rafa and novak right now, what that has meant to tennis and how you would characterize it?
novak, what that's meant to tennis overall.
in general.
in the third set at 2all, it seemed that you came more to the net, played more solid. did you feel more confident at that point that you're going to close it out?
last year you made the semifinals here. do you feel more pressure because of that?
were you nervous? only two points from losing the match. did you start to feel nervous?
what a shame, kei. probably the best tennis we've seen for a long time the first set and up to 31 in the second set. i know you probably haven't had a diagnosis yet, but is it your sciatic nerve in you are back?
congratulations for the two weeks. you won in barcelona. how do you see roland garros? is it michael chang? yourself? you're doing great on clay.
today when did you feel the injury exactly? at which moment did it hurt?
and you knew that you will have to stop or what did you feel that moment?
were surprised by the level of rafa or you were great?
congratulations for your fourth title. maybe it's a little bit bitter because of the nishikori's retirement. happened the same thing to you in australia, or is it tennis?
congratulations for another masters 1000 for your career. i wanted to ask you about nishikori. seeing how he played the first set and the rest of the tournament and barcelona, too, do you think that that potentially he can be no.1 of the world?
before he suffered, did you see another possibility to come back to the match? what was the percentage?
the first day that you sat here you said that you had some doubts. how do you leave madrid to face roland garros?
rafa, are you working on going up to the net? today you didn't do a lot of that, but it was very effective. the second serve, sometimes people that return well, they attack it. are you working on those things?
two questions: first all, the crowd was of course supporting you. but as you just said, you were a little bit blocked. was the crowd a support? and then secondly, you said that you are no longer 20 years old and we have another generation of tennis players coming. which point do you think you are in in your career now?
can i get your assessment of the way you played today and what it means for you to have won this tournament four times playing in front of your home crowd in your home tournament?
maybe somebody ask you in spanish, but you said something on court after the match that he was kind of crying. you go there to say something to him. could you tell me what you said to him?
maybe this also you answer, but could you just tell me your impression of kei nishikori, especially in the first set?
congratulations on another victory. what was it that surprised you most about kei's performance in the first set, if there was anything that surprised you? and even when you were losing it did you feel you could still come back and win the match?
congratulations again for a great match. it was wonderful to watch. just like to ask if you were as nervous as you looked in the last game when you were serving for the match?
just like to ask you how is your back feeling? saw you having treatment last night and tonight. will you be okay to face rafa tomorrow?
congratulations. you were always a good player, but seems like in the past couple months or this year you are going one step further in the rankings, in the games, in the tournaments. why do you think is that?
playing rafa nadal here in madrid where he's won so often, he'll have the crowd behind him. what do you think is going to be the key for to you win tomorrow?
do you take anything out of the australian open? there were three really tight sets. even though you lost, there was a couple tiebreakers in there and a 75. do you take anything out of that coming into the final tomorrow?
when you were serving today, because of your back, did you think a second to give up, or never?
what would it mean for people back in japan for you to have reached a major final in a masters 1000? what do you think the feeling in japan would be right now?
congratulations. can you just a little bit sum up how you've been improving during the week and how you feel your game is getting better and better, and was that the case today?
congratulations for your sixth final here in madrid, and also for your 28th masters 1000?
i added one there.
ferrer has beat on you repeatedly on clay; nishikori, the last time you played together was in australia. who do you think suits better your game tomorrow for the final? who would you like better?
you talking on the court before, and is it more important this week to win than to play well?
compared to montecarlo, how do you see yourself? talking about your legs, your mobility, your reactions.
you played constantly with the noise of an internal riot. had that happened to you before?
one day left for the tournament to win, the magic box is still not full. today was the fullest, but still not full. do you agree with the philosophy of the tournament on the ticket prices?
do you miss federer and djokovic because they haven't been here this week and maybe not going to be next week? does that mean more relax or rehab?
i wonder the main difference you're feeling in the sensations on the court between here and how you played and how you felt in barcelona and montecarlo.
do you ever read what people say about you? when you lose a couple tournaments like you did and certain people say it's the end, he's not the player he was, and things aren't going well, do you ever read or listen to that or hear it?
i just wanted to say it was a great match. we really enjoyed it.
even though you lost, the fact that you went to the tenth match point, is that something positive for you in order for the next clay season, for the fact that you've been playing really well?
some colleagues have said that perhaps it's the best match of the year because the intensity and how you've been playing.
maybe the final of roland garros is going to repeat. nishikori has won. how do you see him?
do you think that one of the keys was the long rallies that you were playing with your backhand? perhaps nishikori was a little bit superior to you in the backhand.
in the epic final set when it was going advantage, deuce, advantage, deuce, it looked like mentally nishikori was losing it. when he was at deuce he was able to get a point; when he got to advantage he seemed to not be able to win the match. did you feel at any point you could rescue the game back?
with this point you're up in the top 30. it is important for you to be up there before roland garros?
well, we've seen you very emotional when you were leaving the court, as if you didn't want to leave.
could you explain the absence of pedro during this week in madrid?
can we know why?
i would like to know if you're satisfied with your performance in today's match against rafa? how did you feel?
in the past, perhaps you had some injuries and you were not able to be so consistent. this year you're better physically talking. do you think you can keep on with this rhythm until the end of the season?
first of all, congrats for the great match. just wanted to say 32, 30love you were both playing really well. from there on, 3 games for berdych. was that the key of the match?
was it very hot out there? normally you play at the night. what did you think about the match today? is it a matter of tv?
i wanted to ask you to talk about the characteristic of giraldo. evaluate his moment right now.
recently we saw you play a lot with your backhand. i don't know if you don't feel comfortable with your forehand. can you explain that?
yesterday we were talking to giraldo and he was talking about important tennis in colombia. the atp 500 tournament was in rio and you were there. seems that the atp is trying to grow in latin america. would you agree that a masters 1000 should be played there?
what would be your expectation for the rest of the tournament? what do you think is your best scenario for the semifinals?
you're saying that you're very satisfied and happy. perhaps the best news is that you've been pretty consistent.
you were talking about brazil and the crowd over there, saying that they support you and that the court is very full. what do you say about the people here in madrid? the court with you is pretty full, but with other players it's not as crowded, like with giraldo.
you were talking about the tennis in latin america. on the calendar there are a lot of things. what would you do? would you substitute one of the current tournaments we have? do you think that the market is very saturated? how would you do it?
yesterday you said that after your win that you played about an hour of what you thought was your best tennis for the past couple of weeks. you struggled a little bit to close out the match. do you feel that you were playing at your best throughout the whole match today and were able to close it out?
you did well with isner. today's match was more equal?
does this give you confidence? we're already in the semifinals.
if you had to choose between both of them, perhaps nishikori's game is similar to your game; feliciano is completely.
for now, david, three spanish players are going to the semifinal. what do you think?
and having such a great day today, how do you explain that none of those days the court was completely full?
first of all, congratulations for making it to the semifinals for the first time in a masters 1000. i wanted to ask you, pablo andujar made it for the first time last year and also played rafa. the pressure have been a little bit too much for him, especially in the first set. do you think you have a possibility tomorrow to win?
your tennis, it's really good. you started playing in castellon in a hard court. where else did you play?
and your type of game, well, you play more flat. is that because of a teacher you had or your own initiative?
i wanted to ask you about the year as a whole. you've achieved very important victories and have gone a step forward. this year you managed to confirm it with those victories.
talking about something else, you were a great football player when you were young; is that true? you left it because you wanted to dedicate yourself to tennis?
what would it mean for you to make it to the semifinal here in a masters 1000 for the first time?
what do you expect of the crowd tomorrow? do you think they're going to support rafa or it's going to be equal, as it should be? you're both spanish.
you were talking about the rafa as one the best players on clay courts. is that a little bit more pressure on you or does that motivate you more?
i know that you also do horse riding. i know you do a lot of sports, and we have to say so.
what do you think is more important right now: the mental strength or physical strength?
for the quarterfinals match, tomas berdych. it's been a long time since the last time he beat you. in rome, 2013, 20 for you. what are you expecting from him tomorrow? it's going to be in the morning, so we'll see.
what do you think, you will lift the trophy on sunday or real madrid wins the 1oth champions league on the 24th?
i want to talk a little bit about your answer. last thing you said before about the good timing that you had to play on the court. perhaps you played your best match on clay. today you said you were playing well, but you said at the end of the match you had something on your mind. was that a good thing or not?
when you said you had something on your mind, what are you talking about?
accepting that your two opponents have been very hard, do you think tomorrow's match is really a test to see if you're playing better?
6th.
last time that he beat you was here in madrid in 2006. can you remember anything of the feelings that you had back then? do you remember something of that match?
the match against pico was a little bit short. this one was a little bit longer. do you think you have good rhythm here with the altitude in order to have a victory tomorrow?
congratulations today. your analysis of the match today? it was going pretty well in the first set and he pushed you in the second set. did you always feel in control of the match today?
you said beforehand you imagine he was going to be a pretty dangerous opponent. seemed to be the case today.
did you expect this kind of match against a player who's having a good run this year?
just going to say, andy, when you sit down and analyze a match like that you obviously try to draw the positive things from it. what can you draw from that today?
obviously it's quick turnaround to rome. what improvement do you think you can make between now and then?
can i ask if your feel like you're lacking just a little bit in confidence still? do you think you need a few more matches and a few more tournaments?
i would like to know, looking back on the 2013, one year ago, what are you missing? there was something last year that's missing this year?
do you think that the fact of not playing today, are you going to lose rhythm of competition or you just take it as a rest day? is it going to be bad for you?
if i'm not wrong, since 2011 shanghai you don't make it to the quarterfinals in a masters 1000. maybe you're not playing your best tennis here. are you surprised to be here in the quarterfinals with the possibility to make it to the semis?
talking about your game, i could see you going up to the net several times. do you think that's something that you're going to build on?
the other day you said that you knew youzhny for many years. you knew how to play with him. thiem it wasn't so easy. tomorrow is nishikori. can you tell us about the match.
first of all, congrats for your victory. i wanted to ask you about your next opponent, giraldo. he just beat murray, and he made it to the semifinal in barcelona. how do you see your opponent's weak and strong points?
this year you're having great victories. you've beaten players in the top 10. this year you made the quarterfinals here in madrid. what do you think is different this season compared to others? what have you changed?
you're not the typical spanish player. does the altitude in madrid help you in any way to make the ball fly a little bit better? do you like it?
first of all, congratulations. i want to talk to you about the people that are not playing here. djokovic and federer; wawrinka left. do you think there is a favorite, apart from nishikori and ferrer and you to win here this year? i think that murray-isner is a little bit complicated.
your friend and opponent monaco was really angry with the umpire. do you think that that was something that affected him?
how did you feel out there? did you need that victory to start with here?
i want to ask you about the people that are not playing here. do you think that the tournament has lost intensity or energy because we don't have wawrinka, federer, djokovic, in comparison to other years?
after the matches that you've lost, does this generate in you tranquility? do you have a different dynamic? does it affect you, especially in the breakpoints out there? do you feel it or not?
you've played a lot of big matches in your career. did you just feel a little extra nerves out there today and wanting to play well in front of your home crowd?
you have achieved your 654th victory. that's over arthur ashe. what do you think about that?
i am from argentina. monaco, i was just with him, and he said that he received a great lesson from your side. on twitter, he just posted a phrase for you saying that you're going to charge him argentinian pesos for the lesson that you taught him?
(in english.) out of all the other tournaments on clay, not including roland garros, does playing in madrid make this one more special than the others for you?
i suspect for many reasons that was quite an emotional win for you tonight. i think the way you signed the camera afterwards showed where your heart is.
how are you feeling physically? seemed to have a few issues with your hip. is that right?
have you few issues with your hip?
did the break that almagro had to have his foot looked at disrupt your rhythm for the second set?
there were times when you were almost smiling quite broadly. is that frustration with yourself that you weren't perhaps beating him more comfortably than was the case?
no, it was good. just curious as to what made you be in such a mood.
no, it's good.
congratulations, andy. just like to ask you how you feel about your next opponent, santiago. he's been playing very well.
i'm doing something on caroline garcia, the french woman and your famous tweet. did you have a conversation with her since this famous tweet?
can i just ask what most pleased about your performance this evening?
you played at home and you've suffered a lot of situations in the match. at the beginning things you were not working, and then you played a great second set. in the end, i don't know what was going through your head.
now dominic thiem. it was going to be wawrinka in that round. i don't know if you want to say something about the draw. maybe it has opened a little bit more without djokovic, federer, wawrinka. do you prefer to do match after match and focus on this young player?
congrats on your victory. you were talking about thiem just now. of course it's a special occasion to make it to the quarterfinals. how do you see the rest of the draw, taking into account three of big names aren't here? can you and ferrer win here and beat rafa?
apart from your opponent's good game, can you say something about your match? can you give us a summation of what happened out there?
congratulations. at the beginning of the game you seemed to be very nervous. was it right? and can you tell me when the match changed?
how do you feel now? you played in such a great level with your backhand, which was very surprising in a way. did you feel very relieved on court after, or how do you explain this very easiness to make...
of course we realize that it is a surprise, but when we saw you playing in barcelona last week, we realize that you are playing incredible, you are doing a very good match, but you lost one match that you normally never should lose. the thing is, how do you feel with your tennis?
how is it important to be in a team with gulbis? does it help you a lot or change something in your way of working?
hello david. i wanted you to evaluate how did you see the match, and especially those up and downs that you had. did they generate more doubts, or the fact that you won the match, does it build confidence?
how did you see the draw? talk about the draw without djokovic or federer.
i wanted to ask you about the one thing you said at the end of the second set. you were saying that you had lost the motivation for this sport. have these things ever happened to you before?
you had been two weeks without playing and you had an opponent that was answering all the balls, which makes you out of rhythm. was that a bad thing?
(in english.) federer won't play this week in madrid. i would like to know if it can be affected for roland garros.
(in english.) but you have experience. if he doesn't play this week or next week you know he will be in it good shape or not?
you were talking about altitude and that the ball flies faster. how does it affect you? do you like it or not?
after losing in barcelona, was this victory really important for you or not?
you're tired. i think that emotionally it's been a very tough match because you came from playing robredo, verdasco in his house. it's a great victory for you, right?
normally between spanish people when you play it's more complicated because you know each other better. in your case, you have defeated two. it's been easy for you or most difficult?
after roger federer leaving the tournament, with him on the same side of the draw, do you think that opens up the draw?
this year you beat berdych, del potro, robredo here. what has been the change to your game in your head? mentally talking you changed?
do you play in yellow because you're superstitious or the brand gives you?
just like to ask you, you seemed to have difficulty finding your rhythm out there. was it the weather was heavy or seppi seemed a bit irregular?
after today's hard match, tomorrow you're playing again roberto. he has just won robredo. how are you going to prepare for the match?
there is always talk about the altitude here, about how fast the ball flies. normally you train in madrid. is it easier to prepare for this tournament than other tournaments in altitude where you don't normally play?
you won the houston tournament and have been playing since 2010 without winning anything. has it been a relief towards the rest of the season? do you feel differently? a little bit better?
hello.
it's been your first match in the tournament. it's been a hard match. how do you face the rest of tournament and the season?
after your first match i don't know if your confident enough. seems like you don't have a lot of confidence. how do you face the tournament?
you have a difficult opponent, dominic. he is a very young player. i think you've never played against him. do you know something about him and his game, and is it uncomfortable for you not to know anything about him?
so can you tell me something about youzhny?
i just wanted to ask you, how do you see the rest of the tennis players? rafa nadal, how do you see him after the two defeats? do you see him with the same confidence? more doubts?
how do you feel the atmosphere here in madrid? in the first round they're always complicated. the stadium is big. there are people that miss when this tournament used to be played on the other site in casa de campo and it was indoor. was it better for the players? do you prefer the conditions then or now?
i need to ask you about real madrid. do you think they can win the league? do you think it's possible?
congratulations.
this is your 61st title and the first time you have won a tournament in the opening week of the year. how special does this feel for you?
congratulations. gal's standard went up in the second set and the match became a very good one. are you pleased with the level that your own tennis reached during that match?
the type of tennis you played in the first set, is that the type of tennis you will be looking for in melbourne?
the australian open comes so quickly at the beginning of the season. how difficult is it for you or any player to judge how ready they might be for it, and stuff like that, without having that much behind you?
when you go to australia and when you play in melbourne park, what is the most difficult thing for you? yeah, we don't know what the court pace is going to be this year, but are the temperatures difficult for you? because it can be really cold one day and then boiling hot the next. what difficulties do you have there?
all the other top guys are already down there. do you fly tonight?
how long will it take you to get climatized, do you think?
how big is your house? do you have enough space to put all these trophies?
when you go to australia knowing that you didn't play there last year and you don't have points to defend, does it mentally take a little bit of the pressure off?
what was the key to turning the match around?
it was a tough battle and you're now one step closer to the trophy. how do you feel?
do you still train during a tournament like this as well as compete? do you train?
practice but also do the training you were doing offseason. because you had a short time. i just wondered whether you were still training and whether that affects your tennis.
when you were losing 3love, you did not look worried. in fact, when you lose a set in other matches, your expression never changes. your face never changes. is that because you do not worry inside, or is it because you don't want to send a message to the opponent that he's beating me and i'm worried?
how much did you know about his game style before the match? obviously he probably knew a lot about yours.
so that made it a little tougher for you to figure him out today maybe?
when you're playing a tournament that's so close to a grand slam, how much are you able to stay in the present, in the moment, and how...
yeah. how much are you looking forward to already next week not next week, but the grand slam.
andy murray has got to go well, he's gone now to melbourne, needing a lot of practice. do you think you and novak and roger and the other top guys will be happy to practice with him or might it help him to get back into some sort of form practicing with you guys?
did you see any of the real madrid guys yesterday?
well done. do you think that's your best performance so far?
what helped you to bring your level up? is it just that you have played a bit more tennis now?
what do you know about your semifinal opponent? he told us before that at the us open in september he actually asked you for an autograph. do you remember that?
how different are the conditions here compared to melbourne, particularly in an evening match here when it can be quite cold?
do you actually quite enjoy finishing off a match with a serve and volley?
well, backhand volley.
we're always looking for the guys that are going to come through and challenge the top 4, if you like, the big 4. do you think if gulbis really, really concentrates on his game he has the potential to do that? and who are the other guys you see as possibly breaking through to threaten?
congratulations. how are you and who are you? tell us a little bit about yourself.
when he saved that match point at 53, i think, in the final set, what kind of feeling did you have? because he saved all the match points the previous day. did you think he was going to win again?
what did you tell yourself to do for the rest of the match? just play point by point?
you may play against nadal maybe.
will you be more nervous?
that was the first time you talked to him?
when is that?
i presume you mostly have been playing challengers?
what keeps you going, hoping for the path, an atp event like this?
it's the best you have done on the atp world tour. why now do you think that you have done this?
the german players have done really well here. why has that happened?
do you know why that's happened?
can you just tell us a little bit about how you started playing tennis and, you know, what you were like as a kid and all that stuff we don't know.
can nadal be beaten?
how do you rate that performance, given that you seemed pretty dominating at least from our side?
are you happy with the quality of the opponents that you have been facing this week, or does part of you feel like it would have been nice to test yourself against a djokovic or murray as you prepare for the us open?
you mentioned at the start of the week about the courts being quite fast here. do you think that explains some of the different names who have made good runs here? is that something you welcome and enjoy yourself?
what are your thoughts on the match tomorrow with tsonga?
do you still learn things about your game each time you go out on the court, roger?
you have played tsonga a number of times. he has a few victories over you. what impressed you or what did he do well on the occasions when he did find a way to beat you?
you have said that you're hoping to play for a few more years for sure. are you at a point now where you enter an event and you kind of soak up each event's atmosphere a little bit more, not knowing if maybe you'll come back again?
tsonga said earlier that he was hoping it would be you he faces tomorrow, because he enjoys the challenge of facing you and your 10,000 supporters in the crowd. how much does it help you knowing you go into events with the crowd pretty much always behind you? and when was the last time outside of maybe davis cup when you feel the crowd was not in your corner or very much against you?
what are your thoughts about serena who did 200 weeks on the top of her ranking this week?
what are your thoughts on serena, did her 200 weeks at top of ranking?
is there anything you saw in tsonga's game, when you were up the break in the third set, is there anything you saw different in his game than we have seen in the past that he was able to not come unglued and roar back like that?
you had some taping on your knee today. is that a problem or did that affect you in the first set? it looked as though perhaps your movement wasn't quite what it had been in the first match.
how big do you see the difference between the jo you beat in miami and today's?
having your opponent withdraw yesterday, how did that factor in at all in terms of your approach today? and did it factor in?
it was pretty hot out there today. i was wondering if the sun was affecting you or affecting your game plan and the way you were executing shots today.
on to cincinnati next. what will you be taking from this match and going forward? what will you be working on over the next week going into the us open?
at this point in your career, how important is it for you to be in the chase for another slam title? which one do you see as would be the most special for you?
can you believe you survived that one?
can you talk a bit about what it was about the match that you kind of canceled each other out a bit at times, yourself and kevin?
that it was such an even match. what was it about his match that gave you such problems?
do you think it came down to mental toughness in the end?
it seemed at times that your body language was almost defeated, and then you saw the crack and you brought yourself back up again and it became like the mental strength that you had.
you took a bit of a spill at one point and you seemed to kind of favor one knee for a little while. how is that knee feeling? is everything okay?
your bum?
how is that? is that okay?
is it all right for the next match?
generally your career is kind of moving along at a kind of straight trajectory, like a linear trajectory, whereas a lot of other players kind of who were coming up, they have big wins and then their ranking goes up and then it goes down and they disappear for a year or two, whereas you seem to be building something kind of in a straight line. is that something that you think about and are working on?
can you just sum up your emotions and feelings after such a tough loss like that.
do you know what happened in that last game when you had the match points?
the level you played at, do you take positives going into cincinnati and the us open?
how difficult is it to refocus mentally after you had those two match points? what do you say to yourself? because you were able to get back and give yourself some chances in that tiebreak.
will this be a very difficult loss to forget? i mean, you have a tournament next week.
can you remember a similar situation in how you bounced back from it?
can you just tell us what happened there today? what was your feeling about the match?
do you take any positives into this us open swing?
you have been up in the top 4 for six months now since what happened in australia. do you feel more of a target now being in one of those top four seeds most tournaments?
i was just wondering, now that you're out of the rogers cup, do you follow this tournament along as it goes, as it keeps going over the next few days, or is it something you kind of keep out of your mind as you head forward?
some may have thought you had a little bit of jitters last night because maybe it was your first match. i heard the comments that you're feeling more comfortable now with your performance today. just want to get your thoughts on that.
that was a pretty snazzy point in the middle of the third set, slice forehand approach and putaway volley. did you enjoy that point?
are we going to see more forehand sliced approaches like that?
do you expect obviously a similar challenge from your next opponent, lopez? just maybe some thoughts on his game and how you'll approach him.
safe to say you and feliciano are good buddies?
how did that friendship develop?
you guys met twice toward the end of the last hard court season. how do you feel you played against him? i believe you won both matches.
you looked very fresh. it almost looks like you didn't look like you played a tournament last week. the two days off between washington and here gave you a chance to start fresh and start from zero?
you came in here, you looked over at the tv to see roger's score. without looking past lopez, is it not in the back of your head about thinking about getting a shot at roger in the semis again?
you're in the night cycle now until the final. how do you feel about playing any of these matches at night, and how does it fit into you being good or bad for your game or give you more chances?
what happened in your eyes out there?
obviously a lot of tennis for you in the last 24 hours. how much did fatigue possibly play a factor in what happened today?
how concerned are you about your performances against gal and against jo today?
did you feel coming into toronto that your preparation was maybe not as good as you would have wanted?
at what time in the match, when in the match today did you know you really didn't have it?
how do you feel about your first loss as a married man?
were you surprised that you couldn't turn it back around today and kind of switch the momentum back to your side?
are you worried at all about the no.1 ranking and defending points and gaining more points coming into the us open?
what can you say? what do you think made the difference when the match is that close?
that final set seemed like whoever was going to blink first was going to lose the match. did you really feel the service game was that important in the third?
yeah, just holding serve.
can you talk about the adjustments you made from the last time you played him in washington to tonight and how do you think you executed on those?
what was it like playing in front of a crowd like the crowd that we had tonight?
i was going to ask basically the same question, but sort of followup on that, did that sort of affect the results in any way?
did you feel, given milos being under pressure here, you have had some success against him that you could maybe, that it was an easier match for you to win than for him to lose, if that makes any sense?
five sets you have played against milos in the last two weeks. four have gone to tiebreakers. you seem like you're right there. does that give you a lot of confidence with your game, knowing you can take a guy like milos to the brink as much as you have?
i guess you'd like to put in a few more first serves in the tiebreak?
after the second set when you lost your concentration, when you throw the racquet, how this could affect as a psychological preparation for the next games or next tournament?
yeah.
you had a big crowd there supporting you. just wanted to find out how much of their energy you fed off to pull through.
do you feel happy with the support? all the canadians was screaming for you.
jack said a few minutes ago he felt there were some inappropriate comments directed toward him. did you hear anything like that on the court?
from the crowd.
is there a special pressure to playing here at home when the crowd has such high expectations?
what did you think when you saw genie bouchard play last night and there were huge expectations of her in montreal and she didn't have a good evening?
can you talk a little bit about the struggle that you had in this match? what did you struggle with?
where are you with the confidence level when it gets to a tiebreak? it just seems like you have no problems when it gets there.
you have met jack so often lately. you two have gotten to know each other's games so well. obviously you have won all those tiebreakers against him. where is the confidence level? you know what to expect with him, especially when you get to a tiebreaker with him. how do you feel about that?
after a match like that, is it relief, is it happiness, joy, satisfaction? like where are you when you win that first difficult match?
maybe especially so given it's a three set, given it's backtoback tiebreakers?
if this is tough like you play 85% of your best because you played your first match since wimbledon, would you expect to play 90, 95% tomorrow?
and benneteau?
was there an aspect of your game you were particularly happy with out there today?
with the back surgery that you had, are you starting to kind of feel like your old self again? how long did that take really to kind of...
is there an appreciation for just how tough it is to remain in that kind of top 4, top 5? did you maybe gain an appreciation for that just kind of, like you said, that if you're not able to do everything off court training and all that, it's kind of easy to maybe slip it down a few spots?
how optimistic are you about this hard court season leading to the us open as compared to the first part of the season? i mean, do you feel like you're reaching a new level?
was the physique the reason why you weren't as consistent as you would have wished?
you have amlie here again. i'm wondering how that working relationship is progressing and if there's anything that she's doing that's maybe different from ivan lendl.
what was the expectation going into like having her as your coach? what were you hoping to gain out of it or gain from it?
novak commented on the draw when it was made that it was a terrible section, partly obviously because you were in his quarter. i know you'll say that you only look one match ahead at a time, but do you ever allow yourself to look at the overall picture of the draw? and do you agree with him, that it is a very difficult segment?
starting off a tournament with such a hardfought battle, does it allow you to get more focused that much quicker when you have such a tough match to start a tournament?
what are the biggest adjustments you have to make when you go four months, you know, clay, grass, and then here you are back on the hard court?
it seemed like you were struggling a little on the backhand today particularly down the line.
that's uncharacteristic for you.
is it something you noticed? how do you make adjustments? did it have anything to do with conditions down there?
physically you were clearly back in shape after your sort of time off, but emotionally it's been quite a demanding month for you with wimbledon and then obviously your personal circumstances. how do you get yourself back into the frame of mind of focusing on tennis again?
i know you said it was fun out there. i'm just wondering if any of the spectacle from the things that monfils was doing was distracting at all or if the crowd was distracting you at all?
followup question on that. i was about to ask you how tough is it to play such an unpredictable opponent? because your next one is a bit like it, as well.
i know you had some time off after wimbledon and i am wondering what you did to prepare for your first masters event here.
how did it feel out there today?
with the rain delays that go as long as they do, how do you keep yourself mentally into it without actually being in the game, with not even starting yet, with the length that the rain delays went today?
is that kind of the best remedy just to hang out and kind of keep it loose, keep it easy?
you've got another big match coming up. considering how well you played in your last really big match, what are you looking for against murray?
do you go in with maybe more confidence than you might expect after wimbledon?
can you talk about how life has changed for you since wimbledon off the court and on the court.
todd woodbridge and a few other aussie greats have sort of suggested that you almost now have a tiger on your back because people know what you're capable of. do you feel there is more pressure when you go onto the court? and how are you dealing with the different sort of scale of tennis life now?
you beat stepanek last year at the french. the difference between that and the way you were playing then and the way you're playing now with the win over nadal and this match today, what would you say is different? what's evolved in your game?
is thanasi still here? was he watching you today?
did you watch him the other day?
what did you think?
following up on some of the changes and the bigger guys noticing you, i know that you were hitting earlier this week with federer and djokovic. i'm assuming that was the first time you hit with them, and i'm wondering how that felt.
did it feel like they are scouting you at all or does it feel like pressure?
i saw you tweeted earlier that you got a ps4 here. wondering which games it was that you picked up.
congratulations, of course. are we going to change the name of roland garros to nadalgarros? how many times you have to win it for that? did you change strategy? because today you played 43 winners; one more than djokovic. play many, many forehand on his forehand down the line, which normally doesn't happen. you always play much more on the backhand. was that strategic? something that you started? i guess it worked.
you got the trophy from bjrn borg, the other legendary winner in roland garros. in this room we were a few in the '70s to ask him similar questions 40 years ago. now that you got the trophy from him, do you think, in 2050 you might come back here? how would you feel coming back to roland garros the way bjrn borg did 40 years from now giving it to some other champion? how would you see in retrospect?
this was a very special victory for you, your fifth in a row. you're the first person to achieve five in a row at roland garros. your ninth victory. you equal pete sampras with 14 grand slam victories. how important would you rate this victory as compared to your first, and also the last year when you come back from injury? how important would you rate this victory?
you talked about the emotion. there was a lot of emotion before the national anthem. it is, of the nine victories, one of the most emotional for you today?
people talk about your big strokes, but you're also so strong on court mentally. you have such an ability to overcome problems. we saw that today. talk about your ability to solve problems on court, your mental strength. do you think that's one of your strongest qualities?
wondering what the feeling is like for you to have this great match that ends with a double fault. it's happened to you before against novak here two years ago, and also against verdasco in australia. wondering what that feels like when a big match ends on a double fault.
tell us about your feelings for the grass court season? what are your thoughts for wimbledon? are you going to halle?
what was the key for you to win today? because novak started with a high level of tennis.
you said that one of your objectives was perhaps rio as well, and to reach the same level as roger federer.
i think everybody cried today. djokovic cried; you cried, as well. when you heard the national anthem, when you received the trophy, i think you were crying. could you tell us more about your emotions, please. what about the rio cup? who are your favorite players?
the french crowd i think was clapping both for djokovic and you, as well.
you have just said that physically you felt that at the time you were going through difficult moments. i suppose that you probably had to find energy deep within you. it's a very physical match that you've played today, the most difficult match physically speaking.
you have won this tournament. now do you feel calmer or at peace for the rest of the season?
your uncle toni said that he doesn't really like dedicating a title to someone, but who would you say this title is for? i would say it's for you.
what does roland garros mean to you and the fact that you've won roland garros nine times? nobody's done that before for any grand slam.
how it went after the first set? what was exactly going on in the match for you?
having to play nadal in roland garros is something totally different than playing him elsewhere. like does he have moral superiority here, or the court's wide, as you had mentioned before? does it make him totally very different than from other courts?
can you just describe your frustration level at the end of the match i guess with match point interruption also, and then just generally not able to break through? seemed like you had more frustration visible normally than you might after...
do you feel that you were not in the best physical condition today since two days ago you seemed to have some nose problems or something. would you say that today nadal won it because he was stronger physically in a way?
this is a hypothetical question: if the match started at 6:00 with no sun and a cooler temperature, do you think things might have been different?
regarding to emotions, do you feel the crowd plays some role since you always are really, really loved here in paris? do you feel the crowd gave you not as good as it always gives you the cheers?
early on you went and broke down his forehand quite effectively. as the match went on you seemed to go over more, maybe try to work more on the backhand. is that an accurate perception? would you just talk about your philosophy there?
on match point on your second serve, someone from the crowd shouted something
positive question about the crowd. in the end, the standing ovation was very special; it went very long. it's almost like people want you to win this title and want you to win a career grand slam.
have you played better this season? that was quite an amazing performance?
were you expecting one month ago when you were losing some matches which you normally don't lose to be able in one month to recover so well and to be so strong? also, did you expect that murray didn't make more than seven points on returning your serve until half of the third set?
two questions: were you nicely surprised as the match advanced that things went so smoothly or easily in this match? did you expect this kind of score? the second question is like djoko has never won paris. do you think that the fact that he will have this big appetite for this first win here might be an extra problem for you on sunday? is that a factor?
do you attach some significance to the fact that you might be in a position to win a fifth straight title of roland garros, and what would that kind of achievement mean to you to win five in a row?
it was interesting that you said during the clay court season each week you learned something.
okay. so what things did you do better?
there is always some numbers mean something, like 42. you're going to play djokovic in the final. is that going to be the 42  the 42nd in (indiscernible).
you don't know that? so i'm kind of curious, how you gonna play such a person you know so well?
the weather was very good. it really helped your topspin today. when you play djokovic on sunday like the weather is also expected to be quite sunny. do you feel that will have an impact on how you play him? also the fact that you have lost four matches in a row to him, but you have never lost to him in roland garros. how confident will you be going into the final on sunday against him? and also, a little bit about the weather conditions, like how it's going to impact or whether a good start is essential for you on sunday to win the match.
what helped you dominate this match? what made the difference between this match and the match between david and you?
apart from this evolution you talked about, we can talk about a great difference in the quality of your game between rome and paris. coming to paris was undoubtedly a great motivation from a mental perspective.
you lost to novak during the final in rome and you changed the dynamics. i don't know if this will have an impact on you on sunday.
you played a long number of hours in rome as compared to the number of hours you have played here, so that should be positive.
you talked about tennis and you said something about your mental strength or mental power. thinking about your experience, how much does mental strength impact your game? and how much will it be at play sunday? because maybe novak is going to win for the first time in paris. i guess you'll have all the statistics in mind when you walk on the court, and that might be difficult.
you had famous rivals like federer and now djokovic. you're talking about these big confrontations. what's the difference between these two?
during this match on sunday, what can be the impact of the weather?
andy, it felt like you brought the best out of your opponent today. do you agree with that?
you played fourandahalf hours more than rafa. do you think that was too much to play your best tennis and have a chance against him today?
you had particular trouble getting into his serve. was he doing something different? why was that the case today?
at what point of the match did you sense that it was going to be a very difficult afternoon?
you're a big competitor. how is it to deal with it on the court feeling that maybe you couldn't find any way to really compete? how do you switch back to grass after such a loss?
do you feel the absence of a head coach right now on your team? has been affecting the game plans, the tactics? perhaps it was one of the motives because you haven't hurt that much rafa today.
you have played rafa 20 times now. is that the most difficult you have found him to handle? that forehand particularly?
is it good, do you think, that you've got queen's to go straight into, or would you rather have a bit of time between the two?
obviously you match your best result here in paris. i'm wondering if the disappointment is for the performance of the day or
or maybe because you felt you had a better chance against rafa this year or wanted to put up a good result since the back surgery?
physically how much time do you think it will take to get over it, and mentally how tough do you have to be to get back out there again almost immediately next week?
on the mental side, do you try and erase this or...
you said before the tournament that you were close to naming a coach. what's the situation now?
what do you think the chances are of you having a new coach before wimbledon?
have you given any thought to what the leadup to wimbledon will be like for you going back to defend there for the first time and all the excitement for that and britain, and what sort of also expectations should be for you, fair expectations for this wimbledon?
in your opinion, what was the difference in the match today?
he obviously was getting frustrated, as well.
in the fourth set we saw you were like bumping your waist. did you have any physical trouble?
ernests, the heat, the hot weather all of a sudden this tournament, how did that affect maybe both of you?
how have you enjoyed the last two weeks? can you just talk about your overall experience of being deep into a slam over the last two weeks in paris?
i think there were a couple of points in the match you gave each other points. he gave you a point in the beginning, and you gave him another one. can you talk about those two? it's not easy to see what happened from tv.
what did you do the last two days? how did you feel the tension coming? what did it mean? you couldn't sleep at night?
your successful tournament here, do you think that as we approach wimbledon it's going to give you more selfconfidence or more responsibility? everybody's going to watch also how you're going to play wimbledon. how do you feel about it?
you made first slam semi here; you're first time in top 10. which is a bigger deal to you? how are you going to celebrate the dual milestones?
you're telling me you're not going to celebrate tonight?
after the successful third set, did you believe that you can make the turnaround, that you can win?
now that you've told us...
now that you've told us that you were addicted to success, do you think in the past you were sort of locked into a kind of failure? and more importantly, do you think with this great result you'll really use it as a stepping board? really, are you really eager to step up and do even better?
how far do you think you can get?
considering you didn't feel that the level was that high from either one of you today, if you don't mind looking a little bit  we don't know who novak is going to play in the next round  but can he win the tournament at that level? is he going to have to bring it up a few notches?
ernest said it was like a struggle from start to finish, and he felt that maybe you weren't also at your best. how did you feel today?
what is going on? i know it took you longer than usual to come to press, also. what was bothering you?
this final, we all know that it's very important for the paris title that you want in your career. do you think that you will have some different type of approaching nadal, or will you play the game that you usually play? what do you have in mind in trying how to deal with nadal?
you have been in a lot of mentally stressful finals before, grand slam finals. is this the most mentally stressful scenario here going into this final because this tournament is so important to you?
you said on the court that the conditions were difficult for you. how much this condition affect your game today?
before this tournament starts, there were a lot of talks about a younger generation, such as raonic, dimitrov, and nishikori. seems like eventually this going to be you and nadal's kind of classic final. do you think it's because grand slams are so different from atp tour that younger generation cannot handle this situation? they are just not good enough to beat you guys?
you're going to play nadal, who lost only six games to murray. are you surprised that he won so easily? that's one question. the second is, okay, you just mentioned the slam, five sets. that makes more complicated for you versus a guy like nadal? you beat him sometimes after six hours, but on clay, with the heat, 32 degrees on sunday, what do you expect?
even though you and rafa have met many, many times, there has been some interesting momentum swings in your rivalry: 2011 when you had the upper hand you didn't get to play him in the final here. seems like you have the upper hand again. talk about those momentum swings and how that makes you feel going into the final this time. secondly, can you talk about the physical challenge you both present to each other.
the match changed totally after the first two sets. how did you see it, and what did you see make it change so fast?
at some point you won like 10 games in a row. was the fact that it was getting darker maybe helping you think that you want to be more aggressive and play faster and try to finish it tonight?
david was saying earlier that he was disappointed by his effort i guess in the third and fourth sets and felt like he faded. did you notice the same thing from across the net, that it looked like he was not able to keep up the effort as well as he usually is?
you have very good memories of roland garros here. you won eight times. but you won your olympic gold medal in beijing. the organizer just announced, you are going to go back to beijing for china open. can you talk about your impression of the city, the tournament?
china open. can you just talk a little bit about your impression about the city.
organizers announced this year you're going to go back.
you didn't know that? oh, come on. it was a big announcement.
i wonder if you were back in the locker room in time to see the final set of the murray/monfils match. but if you weren't, what you thought of the result and a few comments about what you think of the semifinal.
yeah, it was really quick.
mats wilander said he was very impressed with the way andy was playing on clay. he described him as a tactic genius, and he's a threat to all the top players.
he said he's very dangerous.
but are you impressed as well about the way he's playing on clay, or...
david said he made many mistakes during the match. i would like to know if you are satisfied with your match.
when you were one set all, what were you thinking about? were you very nervous?
you're going to play against murray. you played semis against andy murray here, i think. what would you say about this match?
now, what about these eight hours when you had to wait for the match to start? how did you experience this? last year this match was a final. what about this one?
well, i suppose you said that playing on the central court or playing on the lenglen court was like playing two different types of tournaments, i think. for the semis, it seems that the weather conditions will be different, a lot drier. then what would you say about the surface then, the clay?
bad luck today. like we saw in the previous matches like you're not able to take a set off rafa. this year, like you won the first set and it was very close, like you were one set all. and like could you just tell us what happened after that?
during the match you said you didn't know where you were literally. you said you lost your north. does that mean that you were really angry because you were making mistakes?
technically, could you perhaps analyze what's happened and why there was such a turnaround during the match?
you're saying that the court is slow, but others said it was very fast and therefore it would be good for you.
is it very difficult because you won the first set and maybe you thought you would win, and then all of a sudden you fell down?
now what about grass, the grass season? i suppose you're going to rest a little before that.
i suppose it was very frustrating because you couldn't win the second set. is this what weighed on you? because usually you're such a warrior, such a fighter. is it because you lost the second set?
i would like to ask you something. well, you have lost rather quickly and you lost your focus. is it because you realized that against rafa there is not much you can do?
what do you think about rafa?
there are still four players for the semis. well, i know it's off the cuff, but would you say that rafa is going to reign again this year?
obviously a tough match. like in rome, you were pretty close to him. what were the things that worked well for you and what made the difference?
do you have any little regrets in the first two sets?
how would you compare the level compared to simon and your other matches here at roland garros so far?
a lot of people associate claycourt tennis with little spanish or argentine guys running around for six hours and getting the ball back. you have had good results on this. isner has had good recent results on it compared to grass. what is it about clay that you guys have figured out to make your games compatible and thrive on this surface, do you think?
is that something you have always known about clay? is this something you sort of figured out?
was there one moment of clarity?
going forward on clay  obviously not this year, but next year  what do you still have left to do to close the gap on this surface particularly?
the first point of the third set when you sort of got jammed by a ball and he got by you and you missed it, you were on the baseline, lefthand corner, were you just trying to get around it? it kind of surprised you or took a funny bounce?
the game plan today, was it any different than the last time you played him?
there is an old canadian guy predicting you're going to win halle. what do you think about that?
no, but if you keep up this level  forget about what the surface is  obviously you like your chances once you get to the grass.
what is your process to deal with the losses? do you switch easily? do you dwell on it? do you watch the video of the match right after?
what do you take out of this tournament, these two weeks for you? what did you learn about yourself and your game?
converse of guys like you and isner doing better on clay is that the big guys haven't done as well on grass as they did in like the '90s when guys who were big servers tend to dominate there and a lot more aces. what has made it tough for you guys on grass in this era as far as you can tell? even for you individually.
do you think you had the misfortune of bad luck today to play the guy who's playing the best claycourt tennis in the world at the moment?
do you think he's the best claycourt tennis player in the world at the moment?
for your plans, are you taking a few days' break or you're going already to train on grass and then halle and then wimbledon?
it went smoothly to some extent in straight sets. how did you feel on the court?
it's kind of been an open issue this is your chance to have a career grand slam. you had a great match last year with rafa. this is the second week of the tournament. assess your feelings. are you thinking much about this? how do you like your chances?
a lot of times people associate clay courts with guys who run and get every ball back. guys like isner and raonic have done well on the surface well too lately. when you play someone like raonic  tough here and in rome  what do you see he does to make the surface work for him, too?
you played with gulbis, met gulbis when he was 15. he just said before that he remembers you being very professional, doing stretching while he was going out for discothque and things like this. what do you remember of him?
i have a similar question. if you say gulbis is very talented, let's say gifted, it's always a discussion, what is talent. so what do you think was your talent to be far ahead of him over the years? why did it take him so long to get there?
was it your talent you had, like, let's say, how you approach your job with 15 already?
you haven't played gulbis since indian wells three years ago, and you beat him very easily then. i don't know if you have been watching him this tournament, but if you have, how different of a player do you think he is and in what ways has he improved?
what do you think about the match between gal monfils and andy murray tomorrow? you know, both of them really well.
you lost after a very tough match. did you have problems of like you expected to win the second set maybe? you put lots of energy. did you have a lack of concentration after losing, after being two sets down in the beginning of the third? and do you think that murray has improved on clay? how did you find his game regarding his chance for the tournament?
you have been working with thomas enqvist for a couple of months now. what are your thoughts on your cooperation so far? will you continue to work together throughout the year?
in the third set you had an amazing run of saving break points, and then on the last point you had a service winner that was overruled by the chair umpire, and then there was some argument going back and forth. can you explain to us what exactly happened? what you said, what he said, what andy said when he got involved.
wondering how you think that murray's game has improved on clay. he took a set off rafa pretty easily in rome, seems to be playing pretty well at this tournament. have you noticed a change in his comfort on the surface?
you were talking about the court, and you said that the philippe chatrier was a very quick surface.
it's different from the previous years?
how many times have you played on chatrier?
can you briefly analyze the match in spanish.
not all of it, just part of it.
when you talked to pascal maria, did that provide motivation? starting to play very good tennis?
so that means you're going to get a sanction?
because you talked badly to the umpire?
well, they said you called him stupid.
because you said, i don't want to talk to you because you always steal points from me?
talking about pascal, rafa also complained about him. he said that every time that pascal maria was on court rafa got one or two warnings. what's going on?
verdasco complained that the court in suzanne lenglen was much faster than philippe chatrier and that this helped your game. like what do you think about this comment? and do you think yourself that you improved on clay? how will that help you against monfils and the french crowd?
will it worry you if you're not on chatrier on wednesday? i mean, obviously you could feed on the atmosphere and be quite special, or are you quite happy if you have to play on lenglen?
you mentioned on court that you wanted to be aggressive because of your legs. is that tiredness a hangover from the previous match? because the aggression certainly paid off in that match, didn't it?
given everything that you just said, where does that rate in terms of the wins that you have had here?
could you clear up what happened in the seventh game of the third set where verdasco is calling for the supervisor, all that kind of thing? it looked like you basically conceded the point and said, yeah, game.
can you explain why? we couldn't see from where we were.
but you decided sportsmanship was more important than...
it was a gray area, you could have just had a let.
how do you see the next battle against gal?
is that one of the harder hits you have taken from a tennis ball?
was it one of the harder shots into your body?
you mentioned on the court playing gal for the first time when you were 10. what do you remember of that match? what do you remember of him when you were juniors?
did you always get on well with him?
talking about smiling, i know we dealt with this in madrid somewhat, but there are people tweeting people mentioning you seem to be smiling a lot during the match. is this a conscious thing or are you just having a good thing going on?
do you feel you are?
you said you enjoyed the match today. is taking on a bigname player on his home court like gal, is that something you relish, you'll have the crowd against you?
it felt today as if you were as good in the defense as in the offense in the court. like how did you feel about your game? you had lots of great dropshots, as well. so this is what made us probably feel that your game was improving on clay. did you feel more secure in all these shots?
can you just talk a little bit about the match today? it looked a lot tougher than the match against kevin last year here?
you have rafa next. obviously you played him in the final last year. but how different do you think it will be playing him this time when you've just beaten him in rome?
do you take any confidence out of the fact that you were able to beat him on the clay in montecarlo?
i know you don't like this kind of thinking, but looking at the record this year, he's more vulnerable, rafael, than he has been in other years, hasn't had as good results on clay. do you think he's more vulnerable this year here than in the past?
(through spanish.)
i want to have your reaction to the fact that the king of spain abdicated this morning.
what do you think about that?
anderson has a particular type of game, and it suits your game, but it was a great match. you were able to win this time.
again in the quarterfinals in paris. rafa is suffering from the back. do you think you will have some opportunities in two days' time? do you think that you can win?
you have matchbymatch approach, but when you know that you're going to play against rafa nadal, who he's almost invincible here, what do you think of that?
this is the 10th quarterfinal in a grand slam tournament. in the past twoandahalf years your physical condition has been topnotch.
you played the final against rafa last year, so what are the lessons learned from this final last year against rafa?
you have won the first and second sets very easily. in the third set, according to you, maybe you were too relaxed to a certain extent.
after so many matches and so many practice sessions, can you tell me if there could be some new technical assets that you could use?
i don't know if you're aware of this piece of news, because the king abdicated. what do you think of his decision?
how can you put some doubts in rafa's mind on clay?
you know very well rafa, but rafa does not know you very well, because you have changed your appearance. you have changed your look.
you have a new coach. what has the new coach provided you with? why?
a question that has nothing to do with tennis. what do you read this week?
do you think that the montecarlo match will have an impact to tomorrow's match?
it was a lot closer than when you played him last year. you feel you've improved? you're getting closer to beating him?
did you feel like you were back in it after the third set, or did you know that you probably couldn't push him?
he is like a brick wall, isn't he? how do you get the balance right between going for enough and not too much?
you mentioned trying to get to your first major quarterfinal. how much closer do you think you've gotten to achieving something like that?
you've also said that you're happy playing on pretty much any surface. how much are you looking forward to getting on the grass now?
can you talk about how you handled the break overnight and were you worried that the momentum would change? how did you handle that?
yesterday the coach of gasquet told me fernando is playing his best tennis like in australia, your semifinal. is it your feeling?
andy is still stuck in his match. it's not over. but can you just talk about the last time you played him was wimbledon and you were two sets up. can you talk about just how you're going to approach the next match if you do play him? will you be thinking about that wimbledon match at all?
it was easier than what you expected. you had good feelings, i guess. did you sleep well? were you worried or did you feel comfortable on the court?
why did you change so much between the time you played cuevas and the moment you played gasquet?
would you say gasquet played below his level because he was injured? and second, what do you think about the fact there are five spanish guys playing the quarterfinals this year?
you're gonna play murray.
yes, 1210. so can you tell us, what do you think about him? he played more tournaments here than you did. he won grand slams already.
have you heard about the fact that nadal has had problems with his back and his service slightly slower? do you reckon he can still continue to play at his best level?
you had this wimbledon match against murray more than a year ago. was there anything you could have done a year ago to win? did you learn something that you will use tomorrow?
can we safely say you're keeping your level?
what were you most happy with today?
the fact you're playing so well from the baseline, rallying so well, but you're also pulling off scoop forehands and passing shots and drop volleys and all that. does that come from being confident with your ground game, as well?
are you surprised to be doing so well on clay? i mean, in your game, what do you do differently when you play on clay compared to hard court, for instance?
two years back we interviewed in chennai, you go on to win the chennai open that year, and you said your goals were to win for a grand slam. two years later, where do you feel you have reached? do you feel like you're ready to win the grand slams, like french open right now?
your next opponent is very likely to be novak djokovic. is that the kind of challenge you're looking forward to?
your first quarterfinal in a grand slam, what does that mean?
if it is djokovic, what's the biggest difference you will have to deal with with him playing best of three and best of five?
do you think the slow conditions help you with your game? i mean, i know you hit a lot of winners. does the fact it's slow help you to have more time to set up your shots?
when you're really pounding big and hitting well and totally sort of overpowering your opponent, do you get a sense that you're sort of breaking him down, that maybe he's feeling shell shocked and that you've kind of got him at a certain point or generally you're trying to create that sort of impression?
regarding djokovic, what was the first time you met like ever ever met with him? was it like end of juniors or beginning of the pros? what relationship do you have?
in a big tournament like this, what do you fill your off day with? what's your routine on an offday as you prepare for the match ahead?
can you elaborate on what ljubicic and piatti have brought to your game lately?
you were playing at the same time, but any reaction to roger losing to gulbis?
you seemed to be unhappy last night that it had gone into five sets, but how proud are you with how you came through that test?
did you go into the match with any physical issues, or was it something that came on during the match? what did you do last night?
you said a bit on court about having trouble sleeping. were you sort of dreaming about the match, or what was going on?
the mentality of coming into something like today where you know it's a shootout, does that ask different things of you in terms of your preparation?
verdasco next. he probably gave you your toughest match at wimbledon last year. would you say that playing on clay gives him an advantage?
with reference to that last question, do you feel you're playing as well as you have ever done on clay at the moment? if so, what kind of little adjustments do you put that down to?
can you let us into one or two of the little specifics that you're thinking about when you're out there on this surface?
obviously you still have some work here at roland garros. but i'd like to know whether in the past months or recently you have been thinking about how you would feel to come back to wimbledon as the defending champion.
you mentioned that you say certain people don't think you're a good clay court player. do you think you're a good clay court player?
today's match, how important was the net cord at 1530, the 20th or 21st game?
your record in fiveset matches is one of the best around. is that one of the statistics that you're most proud of?
off topic, but i believe you're a heat season ticket holder. how do you like their chances in the finals?
do you see a threepeat?
referencing clay courts, what surface do you enjoy playing the most and why?
were you unhappy that you were serving first coming back out today, or would you rather have returned?
short time on court, which bits hurt on the body at the moment? what do you think you need to do rehabwise to be ready for verdasco tomorrow?
so do you worry that the match you just played will have an impact on the next one physically or are you confident...
looking from outside your career and your game, i mean, you're such a great player. it looks as if, in the grand slam tournaments you have some problems reaching the top levels. what do you think is lacking in your game? you have a complete game. do you think it's like selfconfidence for grand slams, or what do you think is the problem?
did you expect the french people, they were cheering for you, did you expect that before the match that the public would be with you?
can i ask you about last night? you were 42 and 30love down, i think. how did you get back into the match?
he was obviously struggling physically last night. did the fact that you could see him, that he was clutching his leg and that he looked to be in difficulty, did that give you encouragement?
maybe the last few games in the tennis you played today, if you could go back and do it over again, anything you would change at all?
how do you prepare mentally for the start of play today with the score being 77 in the fifth?
murray said last night that he had trouble sleeping, that he woke up several times. he could have played 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning. how did you sleep?
you didn't want to tell us earlier what your plan was. you said you didn't want to reveal your cards. now, can you tell us how you pulled that off?
was it your back? i mean, you took a timeout.
on the last win and back in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2008. how does it feel and do you think you can go all the way now?
ernests knows best?
were you surprised by how kind of flat roger seemed to be after the medical timeout? after just coming out the rest of the match, it seemed like he was missing a little bit more than he was before.
i think you said on court it was the best win of your career. why would you say that?
how important was the end of the second set? do you think that was the key to the match?
is it difficult to play against someone with the support of the crowd?
you're very confident going into the match. you have said things in the past that got people a little bit riled up and bent out of shape. are you gratified you can come through with a big win like this and sort of justify a lot of your outspoken, freewheeling comments?
does it feel good to be able to get this job done on a big court when you speak so freely about your confidence and other things?
were you surprised at the loose game he played in the fifth set early on? because he never was able to dig himself out of that situation. it was a very quick game with a lot of errors. did that surprise you?
he made unforced errors.
do you consider this an upset, your win?
before you won the last point, did you feel at any point you had the match?
do you feel that your racquets do something to you? because you treat them really bad. come on.
you punish them.
do you think in any way knowing that the crowd here was waiting for any chance it could get to boo you, do you think that kept you on better behavior and maybe your focus tighter than sometimes it can be?
you are hoping they're against you again against berdych or you want support?
do you think it's a good symbol for a kid to smash a racquet not only with the hand but also with the foot and then give him as a gift, like it was a good thing like...
you think it's a good gift?
do you actually think that the clay would be your best chance of winning a grand slam?
is there an element of older guy/younger guy? when you're pounding that backhand across the court to his backhand do you feel you've gotten to be a little bit too much for him?
a lot of people are going to be wondering who is this guy who beat roger federer. we know you fairly well, but what do you want the casual tennis fan to know about you?
i'm sure you have been asked many, many times why, since 2008, you haven't been able to go farther in the slams and so on. how many times did you ask the question to yourself? what answer did you give to yourself? another question is many people say that ivanisevic and safin were the best entertainers in the interviews. would you like to beat them?
and what was the answer?
novak is on his way to the court. potential semis matchup.
you know each other for a long time, and you said the success kind of changed him. i wonder, what is your relationship today and do you think such a big win like today might change you too?
you have been improving on your game and your performance for the last year and a little bit more. what do you think is the key on these improvements, and what do you feel you need to improve more to achieve your further goals?
floyd mayweather?
what can you say about the next match? what will be the key to beating tomas?
just about the match and how you felt. it seemed like your back was affecting you out there. just how you felt overall.
the fact of starting late yesterday evening, did that really impact the results or have an impact on the results today?
now, when you were on the courts at 8:30, did you know or did you guess that you wouldn't go to the end of the match because it was too dark?
you were saying you were not strong enough. is it because you didn't practice or hit enough balls?
you have done something good and your back is not that bad. yet you look like you're disappointed even though you have had good results.
how are you going to get ready for the grass season?
will sergi be with you? probably yes. what do you expect from him on grass because this is not your preferred surface? can he help you mentally for wimbledon?
tough luck today. how do you assess your form today? what are your thoughts on the match?
that was quite a long injury timeout at the end of the fourth set. did you have any troubles staying warm or keeping your focus during that period?
how hard is it to come out against somebody like ernests? i mean, you don't know who is going to show up, the ernests who can really play or the ernests whose head is someplace else.
can you compare ernests version 2010 and ernests version 2014?
you have played him three times in 2010.
the break in the fifth set, something you ultimately could not recover from. is that the kind of thing as you get later in your career, are there more spots in given matches where your mind goes out a little bit and you get more vulnerable?
talking about your disappointment, but after all this, you can spend some quality time with your family and with your children. could they give you some kind of comfort?
i'd like to ask you about the future, because most of the people are saying the best grand slam for you, the one you can win is wimbledon. do you feel like that? do you feel you can still win wimbledon?
going back to the rules which let people go to have some massage, to stop the game in some way and come back, and yesterday we have a match when the player won just six points and lost the set 60, and then came back and was fantastic player. do you think it is correct, is normal, and do you think is a normal game that you can do something, you can ask maybe for the atp to do something for someone?
sorry.
53, 4015 in the second set. until the end of the third or the fourth, what happened really? did you lose track of the timing? what happened?
in the game you felt as well as the beginning of the season or maybe today was a day where you really couldn't do what you wanted to do?
how do you assess the tournament? is there anything you're going to learn from this tournament for the upcoming grass season?
different topic: you refused to participate in the international premier tennis league. could you tell us about this decision and the reasons so far?
have you had a chance to talk to edberg? he was there at the beginning of the match and he left and we didn't see him again.
have you talked about this match with him after the match?
now, with hindsight and your experience, can you forget this defeat? it was robredo in the us open. there was wimbledon. are you going to forget this defeat, or do you think you missed an opportunity?
actually, i have a question that i'm sorry to intervene at this moment. it doesn't have to do with the match, but you wrote your great book, which was very moving about the war situation. i just wanted to ask you a question about something you wrote in there where you said describing the bombing during the war. you said: "once you realize that you're truly powerless, a certain sense of freedom takes over to truly accept your own powerlessness is incredibly liberating." i find that pretty powerful. could you talk about that experience, please.
so do you think resilience is one of your stronger qualities now, now that you're in mid career?
i guess you're pretty happy with the performance today. it was clean and smooth.
looking ahead to your next match, what are your thoughts on that? you had a tough one with him in rome recently. how are you approaching it?
i know you used to know ernests gulbis quite well since you were kids. i was wondering if you watched the match he played against federer. if you did, do you think he's on his way to become the top 5 player that everybody expected him to years ago? i wanted to hear your thoughts on that.
i know you know maria sharapova pretty well from doing the head commercials and before that, also. what do you like most about her on court and off?
no, what makes her so good on the court and you having watched her and knowing her off court as well, i guess.
still a question about your two coaches. i'm curious the exact way in which both of them work together. do both of them talk to you after your matches or just one of them? who's taking charge during your training session?
both of them talk to you after matches?
i wanted to follow up on maria. you had yet another really fun head commercial. i think you were out in the wild west in my country, and then you come across one of our corrupt billionaires, supposed to play an exhibition and you barely escape.
i'm sorry.
that had to be a lot of fun.
do you have one takeaway sound bite or story on making that video?
ever meet any spoiled kids like were in that video?
coming back to jo. you had a pretty close head to head at the start of both your careers, and then you took over. can you pick some reasons why you have figured it out so well now.
i'd like to ask you if you have talked to dusan lajovic very much who will face nadal next round. i know he's young, he talked to you and all you guys to get advice. do you have any advice for him for this match?
how should he prepare the match?
congrats. early breaks. good serve. you should be very pleased with this victory.
first quarterfinal since 2010 here. how confident are you for the next match against ernests or roger?
must feel gutted after that one.
seems like you're on an upward arc again, and you sort of tend to do that and sometimes you go down?
how does that work for you?
what will a match like this, what can it do for you going forward?
sometime people forget how young you are. people say, oh, he's only like 24.
you filled out some in the past few years.
you think you're done growing and filling out yet? you getting stronger, you feel?
the atmosphere out there was pretty cool. they were chanting your name. there was a standing ovation. what was it like for you?
how do you take this and build on it? is there a way that you're looking at it differently?
what's next for you?
how big was it for you having all the success in the california challengers last fall? does winning create more winning for you, essentially? is it that simple?
kind of a tough match. the second set seemed to be the swing point, right?
you were all over his serve in that second set. i mean, all kinds of opportunities. what was preventing you from breaking through there?
how mad are you at yourself?
did all the noise from the guys who were down at the baseline there, does that get to you during the course of the match? they were particularly loud.
you had some treatment on your arm. what was it about? just general stiffness? what's going on?
you said he played better than you today, but based on some of the body language and your work with the racquet, seemed like you were pretty frustrated at times in the match. what was not sort of clicking for you? what did you feel was missing?
overall tournament assessment?
what's next?
can i have your feelings to be fourth round here at roland garros? and maybe against the biggest one on the clay.
tell us about the serve and volley on break point, twohanded half volley.
is this the best match you have played on a reasonably big stage?
if you play against rafa, will you ask novak some tips to beat him?
this is the first time you have won backtoback matches on the tour in your career. what's the explanation for this? because you're obviously a better player than that.
can you speak about your relationship with novak, if you have one, and whether you spoke with him or not this week?
can you tell us how important is the davis cup final in your maturation this season?
you had a very vocal cheering section at the baseline. were they guys you knew? family members or friends?
yeah?
you face raonic next. what do you expect from that match?
you had total control of the match for oneandahalf sets, and then it became more complicated. how come?
it's been 16 great tournaments that you have played. i suppose you're very happy.
it's been more or less six months that you've been with artur. when there is a change it's always a bit tricky sometimes. so what has changed?
i don't know if you've worked on this with him, but i would like to know something. i have the impression that for you what is difficult is the beginning of a match. therefore, my question is: have you worked on this with him or not?
we know that perhaps we are looking ahead too much, but will you be playing the davis cup in brazil in september? have you discussed this with carlos moya and the other players? what would you expect from these matches?
you return perhaps better. is this a trick to win?
you have been on the tour for a very long while, so i suppose that you've tried many solutions to improve.
during the second set, could you tell us what's happened? could you explain the second set to us with more details? it was quite strange.
obviously very close match. what do you think was the difference?
good evening. after wawrinka, federer, raonic in five sets, now are you cursed here on the courts?
now, on this match this evening you're bitter probably because during the five sets you came back at the last moment, and then you fell down again. this is when it really turned around.
(no microphone.)
as i was saying, you're disappointed, but does that mean that you felt it was playable, given your level, given the fact that sometimes he was very nervous?
there was a big match against nadal in rome; a big match again today. so are you very satisfied because you're now back on the right tracks, or would you say you're more frustrated today because you couldn't open this door, which is only slightly open?
would you say that milos has improved from the baseline? would you say you felt this and that the other players feel this way as well?
congratulations. how does that feel when you're serving twice for the match and the crowd is going absolutely crazy between your serve and the atmosphere is really, really tense?
in terms of, you know, confidence and satisfaction, is this one bigger than some others in grand slams?
where would you rank that in terms of grand slam victories? most satisfying?
what's the difference now when you get into a long rally on clay than a year ago maybe or whatever, in your mind?
piatti and ljubicic are making a great job with you because you are moving better, improving all shots, improving the backhand. i'd like to know if this is comparable the matches you play versus djokovic in rome where in my opinion you played really a great, great match on clay.
yeah, two matches, and where you are more satisfied the way you played at the end?
how do you feel about going into the second week?
what can you say about granollers?
he returned your serve really well at the beginning and different periods through the match. at the end it seemed you were on top of him with the serve. is there anything you did to cause that to happen?
i talked today to ricardo piatti, and he told me that after you had ljubicic as no.3 in the world, he thinks you have much better potential, and he thinks your goal is to become no.1. do you feel that sort of pressure, or is not a pressure, is just, okay, step by step, everybody sees the same thing? do you feel you could do it or you think, oh, it's a dream?
i'm doing a story on some top players that are not residing anymore in their own countries, which is your case. you moved to monaco three years ago. i'd like to know why you took that decision at that time?
how are you feeling physically after that match? as a fivesetter when it seemed like it went by awfully quickly.
physically not as taxing as some fivesetters might be on you?
i have to retract my last question. i was told all the matches finished today, and granollers isn't finished yet. can you say a bit about simon how he played? crafty guy? he got on the serve for a while? what was it like from his side?
i'd like to know when you did change a little bit your forehand? because before you were playing very close to your body, and now a little bit farther, i think. another thing is for ages we have been talking about you in montenegro, and now everyone talks about you only being canadian and so on. your relationship with montenegro is still very alive. do you do something for them if they have a problem? do you help the state somehow or you have no relationship? how happy do you think they are in montenegro when you win?
yeah.
you've gotta be pretty pleased with that result.
how does the body feel?
a masters reference. i'm just wondering, a lot of times the two sports get paired together, both individual sports and there's a country club background. how much easier do you think golfers have it?
do you feel like you control your own destiny more in tennis? golf is almost like a race where you can't stop the other people. here you have a chance to stop whoever.
is there a sort of cumulative, maybe mental drain at all when you're in a match like that and you do get some break chances but you can't convert and they sort of add up?
talk about him a little bit. he's out there for a long time. he missed basically not at all for that whole match. how does a guy like that do that? what's it like playing a guy like that?
you have spoken about some of your problems you have had in european venues playing here. just talk about sort of winning on clay against a guy who is a pretty darn baseliner, spanish guy and going really deep into the french, is that kind of a feelgood moments for you, redemption? just talk about that.
is your own play improving match to match?
there were times when you were up two sets to none when robredo had won something like 13 or 14 more total points in the match.
did you have a sense? you could feel that sort of?
on the women's side, top three seeds are out already, and third round is not even over. do you ever wish that could happen on the men's side? because that never happens.
how would you describe the clay here? what makes it special? how dirty does it leave you on your clothes?
you said on a few occasions when the subject of american tennis came up, you don't really care what other people are doing or what historical lows have been reached. does the reverse apply here? you have broken the second week streak that goes back to roddick. does that not matter or...
fun little question. do you view the media as sort of ragging on you guys or just telling it like it is? in terms of american tennis, what's your view on the job we do?
talk about jack's game for a minute. it's got some pop.
can you speak about the thought of playing tiebreaks? you already played eight here in roland garros. how demanding is it? how different is it from your normal game?
courier and higueras in a piece we did this week were both pretty critical of younger guys' work ethic, not all of them but a number of them, saying they didn't understand what it took to get to the top and really had to up their game in order to make a real impact. do you agree with that? it's clear from the rankings when you're not making to the top, why would these guys not think there is more required?
are you surprised that they don't get it? because obviously you just look at the rankings and see who's up at the top.
younger guys.
change of gear, i know you have been close with james and there was that terrible tragedy at his house.
have you spoken to james? can you share a little bit what his response was?
you're on the road and you hear about something like that happening in your 'hood. i imagine it's a pretty quiet, pretty refined place. just talk about how you deal with that when you're in madrid.
this is the first time in 24 slams you made the second week.
does it feel like that long?
a lot changed since then, i imagine.
how pleased are you with the way you played today?
and the fact that you played a tournament and won and came in here, a lot of people think when you win a tournament the week before you're going to be tired. but is having one day in between the matches the key?
why do you think it has taken you so long to be sitting in that chair again?
well, maybe you just remind us, me.
lately, and especially today, you have been really focused from first point to last point, no outburst, no racquet smashing, no nothing. have you worked on it, or is it just coming with the win and the confidence?
is there something in the french air or is it confidence, you won two tournaments and play here the first week amazingly? do you have an explanation?
when you think back to the times of bad decisions, do you regret that or do you think it's something you needed to go through?
you have two younger sisters that play tennis, as well. are they going to be as good as you? when was the last time you played with hem?
you and cilic, del potro, and de bakker, are all born one month of each other. do you look at them sometimes or have you looked at them during your career and try and measure where they are and where you are?
the other day you were saying that, you know, when you were younger and you were training in germany and novak was there that you were noticing how professional he was even at that young of age. so seeing that and noticing that, why weren't you as professional younger?
if by any chance roger wins, what's the game plan for roger?
if it is tursunov who just won the second set
yeah. if it is tursunov, i know you won a doubles title at some point and you know each other very well. you would probably be the favorite in that match?
to come back to your possible match against roger federer, are you, in your mind, are you a favorite in that match?
just about playing if it is roger you'll be on chatrier, does that kind of theater and court get your adrenaline flowing more than somewhere else?
congratulations for another great victory. a different match rather than diego's match. what were your feelings on this one, please?
do you think the injury affected him, the key to achieve the victory?
after changes in the personal life of the players, everybody is asking how can it affect you in your game. you lost in rome, but here in roland garros you are going up. do you think your new babies are affecting your tournament?
it was a hard match, but he did get too many looks on your serve, really. you saved both breakpoints but in the third set which was just eight games, it was tough, true?
you were on the same court during practice. how does that work with you?
you have gulbis next. he seems to be he claims that he's a completely different player now than before. have you seen him play recently? what are your thoughts on this match?
you are a real social ninja. twitter...
have you ever thought about having press conference on twitter using special hash tag?
have you ever thought about idea of having press conference on twitter, asking journalists to ask you...
second week for you. how do you assess your run so far and this match today? you had set point, you could have won in three sets, in straight sets. you ended up playing a fourset match. was it tricky or not?
with gulbis it will be a special match. he's able to deliver some incredible shots.
at the start of the tournament you said that for the first week what matters was to get through to the second week. after these three matches what do you think of your game?
do you think that your level of play is ready to play against gulbis?
for the 12th consecutive time you will reach the last 16. what do you think of that?
so you have your twins, even though they don't watch the match but they read books. what do you make of that?
after the first two sets, it became a bit more complicated, the conditions and march rain playing very good. how did you feel out there?
being on lenglen maybe did it have any influence, the court, not being used to it or sliding a bit?
dominic thiem said you are the only player who can play fit in the court against rafael nadal. do you think it's true? do you have any thoughts about that?
in the past days you said, you mentioned the fact that croatia and serbia all got together to help the population with the crowd because of the flood and so on. i'd like to know if, apart from you, also other tennis players even like marin cilic or other croatian, if you have talked to them and tried to do something together? because you spoke about this solidarity around the world.
then afterwards you did okay. that's it.
can you say some words about your work with boris becker here in roland garros. how is he helping you? what are you guys working on and what does his presence mean for you?
if i could, i'd like to ask you: what do you consider the biggest win of your career? what loss was sort of the toughest, most brutal to take?
can you just mention what those slam losses were?
just how many languages do you speak? what's the next one you're working on? how has that helped you in life? how many languages is your book in?
how many languages is your book translated into?
yeah.
more than americans?
have you heard about gulbis' sexist comments today? he said he hopes his two sisters won't become professional tennis players because women need to think about having kids and they need to enjoy life. and he said also having kids he thinks they can't have kids until they are in their late 20s, which is tough. what is your opinion?
what is yours?
this is a question from fans. your brother, who is trying to be a successful tennis player, is is that the case? marko?
what will happen the day you play him in a tournament and he will beat you?
when you're coming back in the last set, winning the third, going to four, do you think maybe you can make this turn, because you were playing really aggressive against him?
i think you've been a little bit more consistent ever since you started working with goran ivanisevic. why don't you talk to us about your relationship with goran and your expectation for the season on grass now.
your expectations for the season on grass?
it seems a little bit out of nowhere, you haven't played too much on clay, haven't had much success here. now you're in the third round, played a quality player straight sets. talk a little bit about what's going on.
how much do you actually play on clay? i mean, in the u.s. there is a push to build more clay courts and to practice more on it. but how much are you actually exposed to it regularly?
is part of doing better here is you feel more comfortable in bigger setting, bigger matches, you get up for it more?
i kind of wanted to ask you about your years in chicago. looked up a quote from obama that said, let me tell you something, i'm from chicago, i don't break. just talk about your years there, tennis in chicago. does that help you in some way? or just talk about it.
if i'm correct, i think midtown maybe helped you out a little bit. did you play on public courts? was it kind of tough out there? talk about that.
the scene at hyde park, was it pretty intense or a good scene?
taylor townsend had a big breakout here. talk about when you first met her, and that's probably earlier than anyone else at this tournament.
have you talked to her at all about handling this sort of spotlight? you have had a lot of experience at that and she's sort of getting started.
what's the connection? how did the families know each other?
speaking of another talent, have you had any contact? do you know much about francis tiafoe?
having been through the hype machine a bit, what kind of advice have you given him or would you give him?
can you give us a feel on your thoughts of your progression to this point in your career? are you happy where you're at? had you hoped to be further? just a general look.
do you have any thoughts why it hasn't happened? do you think like you were, you know, too much hype around you or things like that? any thoughts on that?
so do you feel a lot of pressure trying to be the last person with chicago roots that's left here in the draw in the french open?
about the match today, what do you think was really working for you? he seemed pretty frustrated. what were your keys today?
you said if you had it to do over again you might do a few things differently. could you tell us what those things are?
has your training setup changed since australia?
it's been a surprisingly good tournament for the american men by a lot of standards, because there is only one guy in the top 50 now but there's going to be three, you, john, and whoever wins between steve and jack today. do you feel this coming, or is it something that's sort of surprising to you as it is to us?
first big match on chatrier. can you speak about your feeling? how hard is it to play against rafael nadal?
you did not seem very intimidated, given all that and knowing all that about him. you seemed to go out and find your game right away?
you said that maybe in two or three years' time is your time to play against like big players, but i was wondering which kind of outcome you can take from today. because actually, you could find some ways to hurt him, as well.
don't you think you have to improve your position on court to try and play not so far, much closer to the baseline, to struggle less?
did you get any advices from ernests before the match?
nadal had some tough matches this year on clay. do you think he's maybe a bit more vulnerable than in the past, or do you think he's just as strong as the player who won, you know, eight titles here?
what were you most pleased about in your own game today? and what surprised you most about rafa's game?
many players say that his ball just arrives differently because of his extreme spin and things like that. what was your did you have any trouble handling that? did you find it different from other players?
what is the most difficult challenge against him?
jack, third round at the us open a couple times. now in paris. what does it mean to you? how do you feel about the way you played today?
is this your favorite surface? can you elaborate on why that is? you can't have seen much red clay growing up.
you know johnson pretty well. what's that like to go out there against a guy you know pretty well at a tournament like this?
are you going to forgive him for the body blow?
just the whole court either side, right?
so situation like this is a big opportunity for you. the draw isn't brutal as it might have been in some other situations. are you aware of that? how do you deal with that mentally? anything different than anything else that you've dealt with before?
you said you didn't play a lot on clay, but the usta are encouraging more clay courts to be built and to practice on it. in your training, how much are you seeing clay? how is it maybe helping you? are you seeing more clay action?
how happy should we be with three americans in the third round here in paris?
in a country with the rich tradition that we have, i mean, now it's sort of like, wow, we have three guys. it's good news, but how does that sound?
do you agree with usta's approach to clay as a way to make players today and have juniors have a lot of contact with it? we've had a lot of players in the past history that haven't done that, but how about now?
seems to be that's the way you learn how to create points and really understand the geometry of the court other than playing on something fast where one big shot might create a whole...
do you consider green and red clay pretty different?
what was your first tournament on red clay this year? when did you come over?
if you like clay and red clay, why didn't you come over earlier and try to qualify or...
did you watch andre when he won the french open on tv?
what is your earliest french open memory as a viewer?
you must be fairly pleased with the way you played today because you brought a lot of power and aggression to the match?
you have such a great history here, you're such an icon here. these young guys who are really talented and maybe aren't afraid like some other guys, they must really look forward to playing with you. is this an advantage or a disadvantage for them?
you played dominic thiem for the very first time. he's austria's big hope. what do you think the future can bring for him?
last year you needed four sets in the first round and the second round. this year you only needed three sets in the first and the second. are you surprised that you were able to find your rhythm so early in the tournament?
for a long time there has been a little boy over there in the yellow bandanna peering in, looking at a press conference in tennis. do you remember the first time you saw, you viewed the great sport of tennis at the professional level and were you inspired by that moment?
but people talk about that inspiration that you have, not just year to year or tournament to tournament, but even point to point, always fighting, giving everything. where do you think that comes from? did you have it from the beginning? did toni help? where does that come from?
congratulations for this win. well, you dominated such a player, dominic thiem. can you tell us more about your feelings, please, and what you think about this player and his future?
would you say that you feel safer today, i mean, against a onehanded backhand player, versus the twohanded backhand player?
it's the first time for the time being you have played on the central court. you said it was sliding too much and a bit too heavy, i think.
i think you left for a little while in the locker rooms. what's the reason?
what about your feelings? what do you feel now after the match against someone you had never played against before?
what about leonardo mayer? what do you know of him?
have you served that well in a little while? looked pretty good.
that was a very comprehensive victory. there were moments you were getting pretty cross with yourself, calling yourself an idiot and all that kind of thing.
kohlschreiber next. i'm assuming you're expecting a tricky match there?
what do you remember of that match in montecarlo?
hbo show, "nhl," they mic up the players during the games. you hear the things they say to each other, colorful cursing, it can be entertaining. do you ever think how entertaining if you were ever mic'd up during one of your matches, talking to yourself?
spanish, you're talking about, particularly?
are you glad that no one can hear it ever except if they are sitting right next to the court or do you wish there was a way for people to sort of hear the monologues these players give sometimes?
there are lots of rumors about who is going to be your next coach. last one was amlie mauresmo. how do you feel about that? is it annoying you? do you have fun about it?
and some was rumored to be your next coach, is one good or some names not all good ones?
none of these names are the next coaches for you? that's all rumors?
apart from the serving you must be pleased over the way you attacked his second serve?
i'm not expecting any names, but have you talked to any potential female coaches?
every grand slam these days feels the need to modernize and get bigger and better. are you slightly somewhat disappointed that courts like the one today are going to be demolished and the great atmospheres that we have loved on courts like this you'll no longer be able to enjoy them anymore?
what was it that you liked so much about taylor townsend yesterday?
just to go back to the female coaches issue, do you think it would be good for tennis if one of the leading male players had a female coach, like a good message?
would there be a stigma, do you think, attached to a man having a female coach or not?
do you think that the score is really tough for you?
is it tough compared with the way you played?
he's famous for serving very strong on the tour, but it's more than that, according to this match.
if we discuss the whole tournament, you went through the first round so you did your job.
what are your plans for the future? what are your next tournaments?
you said before the tournament that if you wanted roland garros to change your life you had to reach quarterfinals. you didn't. is this tournament going to make a difference in your life?
you're going to get a nice check, though. will this change something for the season? will you feel more comfortable because you've got more money?
you said anderson is ranked 20th. during this match, do you really feel precisely the distance between you and the highest level?
about money again, the question i'm asking  or maybe we're all asking ourselves the question  what is your budget? talking about travel costs or expenses. how much does it represent?
regarding the crowd, the whole crowd shouting axel, axel, you never had that before. if you go to challengers and futures it's going to be nice.
what will you remember from this match? you were very close at some stage of the fourth set. maybe you lacked some stamina to upset him more.
and generally speaking regarding the match, what will you remember, and especially regarding your game level?
first set you had a break chance twice.
although you lost, you won your first match in roland garros, and that's what you need to remember. you gave a hard time to garcialopez who defeated wawrinka.
garcialopez is typically a type of player who's really difficult on clay. he pushes the ball back all the time. you look pessimistic, but you didn't do a bad match.
any positives regarding the tournament and the second round?
are you going to continue with eric prodon, or was it just for this tournament? what about the future? will you think about it together?
did you feel that eric already was becoming a coach because he's coming out of some extremely good qualifiers? did you get the feeling he was already a coach?
five months ago you won the noumea challenger. five months down the road, what do you think? how do you assess these five months?
okay. sorry.
not too bad?
do you have any idea how long you can last?
after a week you said, don't expect anything from me. and this situation, isn't it going to help you, isn't it ideal for you?
you made us lose a lot of money today. do you still say we should not bet on you for the next round?
do you have a preference between verdasco or his opponent? they are fighting right now.
do you have a specific program for recovery tomorrow?
in the beginning you didn't move very much. was it to try and preserve your back? what was your strategy?
was the support from the crowd playing a decisive role?
so are you enjoying the tournament? initially you came here without any pressure, and then you are through second round twice in three straight sets. you're playing well. not in pain. not too much. so you think you can still play this year?
on service, which is the difficult shot, when you're in danger, you try to gather speed. can you really put in a really good first serve nowadays, today?
the idea was to shorten the rallies when you could, because you didn't have a good physical condition?
it's because it was since birthday that you played so many winning points? i mean, you played an unbelievable number of winning points.
you were relaxed today on court?
you haven't worked enough for sergi for him to have changed anything fundamentally in the way you play technically. but in the way he approached the match, what he said, did he say anything that was technically helpful?
you had a good pace and then a second ball landed on the court. there was a problem. did it upset you?
it was a ball sent by teddy riner. that's what i read on twitter. was it a bet?
getting back to winning in this tournament, how are you feeling? sort of settled down in this tournament compared to maybe how you were in rome? are things coming together for you here compared to rome? do you feel more calm, maybe?
monfils in the third round. you two have had some interesting meetings in the past.
you two have two of the biggest personalities on the men's game. do you feel that when you're on the court?
do you think it will be a normal match or something crazy?
so it won't be boring?
can you tell me what you think about bolelli, the way he is today? you know, we come from italy. we would very much like to know what you think about bolelli. do you think he's still a good player and that he has potential? what would you say? what do you think about him?
(off microphone.)
what can you say about your match? what did you think about it?
it's your first match. can you tell me what's changed when you have to play against a player you have never played against? do you watch videos before? how do you get ready?
you have said that what you mean is to do something with your forehand and to shine more with your forehand.
during the match you gave us the impression that perhaps the balls were quite heavy. would this have an impact on you?
there are four spanish girls who have gone through this round. what about the future? would you say that female spanish players will be more famous than the male spanish players?
you were talking about the court and the balls that were a bit heavy and it was a bit windy. well, you know, the spanish players feel better when it's really sunny and warm.
now, back to female players, i don't know if you saw garbine's match, could you tell us more about her? do you think she's reached her maximum, or do you think she can reach the semis?
who's your coach today? do you have good relationships with piles still? because i heard that he was discussing with winsley [ph]. do you still have this friendship between you and javier piles?
now, after the acapulco tournament you had to withdraw because you were injured. are you okay now? what did you do to recover from this injury?
are you superstitious?
what about your haircut?
now, another question nothing to do with tennis. i'd like to ask you about the brazil world cup, the soccer cup. what about the spanish players?
what about the davis cup? now, since we are talking about brazil and spain, what i'd like to know is that well, you know that on paper this meeting is not really what one could call an obstacle. by the way, are you in the team?
what about carlos, if he calls you?
do you remember that you played two matches or two rounds in less than two hours during a grand slam? does that ring any bells?
so how come? what's the reason, according to you, it's a very good start for roland garros?
how can you play in a free way, as you say, when this was one of your main problems during your career? you said you would lose a lot of energy during the first rounds in the past. how did you manage to do this?
being relaxed is something that you discussed. is that something you work with your coach?
do you have the impression that there is more continuity between rome, nice, and roland?
you were saying that the poor weather conditions are good for you. what is different? could you describe this, please, for us?
you said it's two elements. you've talked about the first one, that is the style of the first opponent, that's the first element. and you said i think also the mental approach to the match, that's the second element. what does that mean? that is the way you're ready for this in the locker rooms? or what does it mean?
how did you feel in that match, especially at the beginning where first set was obviously the toughest of the three?
did you see the level of your game going up from the first match, which is obviously what you want in a slam?
when was the last time you played a guy that was taller than you?
so it's not unnormal?
just want to ask you: what is the role the weather is playing right now? how is it making the game different this year compared to maybe the previous year?
heavier ball, does it take a little bit of zing off your serve sometimes?
you're not an old guy but do you feel experience was a bit of a factor there today?
by the sounds outside, did you hear that little contingent of kids who were cheering for you right beside the court?
kids' day.
it's actually a field trip from thornhill, ontario.
how do you feel about simon? just the one time in estoril against him?
it's a grand slam, and it's also your business. obviously you want to come out for every single match and be intense. do you have any theories about why sometimes you come out and there is a lack of intensity and sometimes everything just goes just fine? are there any particular factors that play into that? do you have any ideas?
after last week in rome, your confidence levels, are they different coming into this grand slam after pushing djokovic so close? do you really feel you have a good chance at this tournament to go all the way?
what would be the key if you're playing like a french player at a french open or an american player at the us open, a seeded player like you did with gilles simon, what's the key crowdwise? how do you keep your focus in what you're trying to do?
doesn't bother you at all?
this davis cup atmosphere?
a lot of upsets again this year. do you see the younger generation stepping in and challenging the established guys this year?
you seem to be hitting your forehand better and your backhand better and you're moving well and all that stuff. inside yourself as you're playing, are you feeling that, too?
can you think back to the match that you played against lleyton hewitt at the australian open which probably seems like a million years ago by now and what you learned from that one? that's a similar situation as he was talking about in terms of playing a frenchman here in paris.
i know you haven't played on the center court here. how much would you enjoy doing that? there is like obviously a chance if you're playing simon.
physically what happened on the court?
do you have a schedule that's very precise, or will it vary depending on your physical ups and downs?
have you tried other surfaces, by the way?
you discussed with the referee or the umpire on the court. what did you say?
now, given what you've said, you have said that sometimes it's difficult for you to focus completely from a to z during a match. what about this injury that you're suffering from, which i hope is the end of this injury, i mean? don't you think there is some good in this evil?
you felt you could have defeated bautista, but you have never defeated him. how come?
in this match i had the impression that the crowd is always willing and ready to support you, because your game sometimes is brilliant. the crowd, the public, is quickly here to support you like a davis cup match. are you aware of this? does that touch you? does that help you?
djokovic yesterday took a photo of himself playing the french ptanque.
(off microphone.)
will you remember this match that you lost yesterday, will you remember that forever?
how did you manage to sleep last night? i guess you had many things on your mind.
did you see yourself winning the match yesterday? he was in a difficult position. did you see yourself winning the match?
would you say that this is a huge step forward for you?
would you say you've won your spot in the davis cup team because you attracted such a huge crowd? that's quite unique. have you ever experienced that in any of your matches? what's the impact on you?
so you're back to your daily routine. what's your agenda? are you playing a future?
did you log onto the internet to see all the fans you have after your match today?
how did you sleep last night?
i didn't see much match of the match yesterday. had you been pounding his backhand as much as you did in the finish today?
we couldn't hear anything, but we got the impression that with wayne mckewen you were trying to tell him you would like to play on last night?
just talk about how you turned that match around. obviously two sets down it was not looking...
talk a little bit about how much you were fighting the crowd. obviously you were playing a frenchman.
at some point yesterday did you honestly never think that the game was lost?
before fighting lokoli, did you know he was beginning to be a kind of phenomenon here? people are talking about him more and more.
you broke the heart of millions of french guys. there was a time when the top three ranked americans were college guys. what does that say to you?
why is it a more viable path now than maybe a while back?
did you watch danceoff on youtube?
when you get that kind of support that way he had, there is also an a lot of pressure. did you think about that? did you feel that maybe that would give you an advantage if you could stick with him and get him to blow himself out emotionally?
this was your first five setter too, wasn't it?
tight first couple sets. just talk about the match a little bit.
the rain or the cold?
selfrecriminations there. you were pissed at yourself a lot of the time.
coming into the third round. it's been a while since you got past that hurdle in a slam. is there any meaning, getting that one step further, would it be a big deal since it's been a while since any american guy made it to a second week at a slam?
have you played robredo on clay?
he's a serious dirt baller.
even though it's on the women's side, does it send reverberations through the american locker room when something happens like serena losing or on theother side like taylor townsend winning, which i think was when you were on court, soyou probably didn't see that.
i imagine you're hoping for drier, sunnier weather?
why not dubs with sam?
how are your impressions making a firsttime slammer like diego playing on a big court and like in front of an idol like you? how do you feel about that, please?
i just want to ask you in terms of your forehand going off sometimes in terms of timing, how much do you think the game needs to get better for you this week and next so you can be content?
the brazil world cup is in the corner and switzerland is going to play. how do you feel about this world cup?
kim clijsters just sent out a tweet with one of your comments that you made, which was: sometimes it's okay just to be happy to be playing, that it's okay just to enjoy the game. you don't always need to be a success. some people don't get that. could you just talk about that comment and sort of the balance between tennis as a job, your profession, and the joy of the game?
you said you were not really free or relaxed. what's the reason? didn't you feel good today? was it due to the weather conditions?
how do you feel physically after the first two rounds? next is going to be dmitry tursunov, as you said, he's a different player. do you feel good versus last year when it was difficult with your back?
you said you know dmitry tursunov. you played against him. what are the keys for the future match, please, the keys?
roger, wawrinka, after being defeated, after the first round, said that it's difficult for him to manage the pressure due to the title in australia. he said that's the difference between him and djokovic, nadal, or you, because you can do this. maybe we don't realize this all the time, but you can take the pressure and you know you've got to win and you manage to win tournament after tournament. do you understand his position today, that is, it's difficult i think for him to take this title he won?
nine out of nine, although you knew what to expect. you didn't find a way to manage this?
you served well, but he returns very well. is that a problem for your game? where is it you're stuck?
you said you were going to try some new things with him. what was your game plan when you walked on court?
do you feel like you have the idea or game to make him look good?
the fact that you were playing on central court, was that an additional pressure? maybe your landmarks were different?
you have been playing better lately. you had a good tournament in rome. what about the frustration? are you thinking about what is coming next?
do you see him winning the tournament?
what about your plans now? are you moving to grass immediately?
we get the feeling that you felt better than last year when you were playing tsonga.
congratulations.
that was a tough one to get through, but in the end you managed to win six in a row. how did you feel about the match?
the conditions were a bit tough. it's a bit chilly and stuff. you managed to handle that.
you were getting a little irritated at the amount of noise from the crowd. i find that interesting for someone like you who has such experience with davis cup away ties. was it different because it was kids or what was irritating you today?
you get to play bautistaagut next. i believe you beat him and also lost to him.
how do you look ahead to the match, and what's difficult for you in his game?
i want to ask you about the football world cup. who's your favorite team?
who's the best team for you?
both top seeds in the women's draw are out. i was wondering if i put you on the spot and asked you, who do you think can win the title on the women's side?
obviously a tough one for you. are you happy with the third set?
lleyton was saying before when he had his hip surgery it took him months and months get back to full range of motion. can you tell us how it is out there for you, how it's affecting your play, and how long it will be until you sort of get back the level you were at?
last year you couldn't have your father by your side; this time he has been allowed to be with you at the french open. does that make a difference, and was that easy to have that accepted by the french tennis federation?
what's the difference between having him there and not?
so is velimir stepping aside after this tournament, or is he not even here?
expectations for the grass?
how concerned are you about confidence levels as you're trying to make this return? following the operations and the rehab and all that, are you struggling with any part of the hips? are they feeling fine? still troubling you or do they hurt? but more so on the whole confidence issue, because it's so important in the game, as you know.
how do you feel when you walk through the gates at wimbledon? is it a different feeling to walking in here?
and what about walking into wimbledon, what's that feeling like?
your dad had a court case to go through in his year off; he still has a civil case going. how confident are you that he can have the focus you need?
is that any distraction at all on you?
so your program now, what do you do between now and wimbledon?
what leadup tournament are you playing? queen's?
talking about rankings, so you set yourself goals and that sort of thing? do you feel like you have to sort of rule any of that out this year and just get yourself back to a level where you can be competing week to week?
when you think back a couple of months, would you rethink what you did and try to play in miami, that maybe it was too soon to try and come back?
it's only compulsory if you're fit. you just get zero points. did someone tell you that you had to play?
hi. during the second set you called the physiotherapist. why? what was the matter with you? what was the potential impact on the outcome of the match?
when you felt that pain, you couldn't fight?
you talked about the first set. after the loss of the first set, then you threw in the towel, so to speak?
it's very frustrating to be knocked out this way.
what is your injury all about?
what kind of noise?
you've said that you will continue to play the doubles?
what do you feel? what's the feeling that you have?
why are you angry? could you give us more information? why do you feel frustrated? is there something special in your match that you're angry against?
i have the impression that during the first break points you had love40 in one game, and this is when it turned around.
what about your thigh? there was strapping on your thigh. physically is that okay?
according to you, would you say there is an objective reason why you were so inhibited during the match?
this is nothing connected to your match, but karlovic has defeated dimitrov, and you belong to the big servers brotherhood, if i can say that. what would you say about him as player? what does he represent?
i don't know if you watched the match; he won. did you think, oh, well, maybe the conditions are good for such players as we are?
he's very unpredictable. did that make it tough today as well to read what he was going to do?
i know you say that it's not easy to enjoy your matches when you're in the middle of the great years of your career, but do you relish being back out here after the year you missed and also before that the year when you were a bit constrained by the back?
how do you sort of rate your own performance then?
even with your experience now, when you see people like stanislas going out and li na going out, is there a sense of feeling, well, at least i got that one over, because he was dangerous, wasn't he?
you had a few issues with the camera during the match. was there anything different about that today from previous years?
is this the first time that's happened on that court?
you talk about feeling your way into tournaments and finding ways to win when perhaps you're not playing your best. was that very much what you were talking about when you were speaking about the champions league final on saturday night and gareth bale was on?
are you going to be using that business card that you got at the end of the match?
on a serious note, was it easy for you to put aside the coach issues for this tournament and then sort of pick that up at the end of the tournament?
i believe matosevic just beat dustin brown. he's your next matchup. what do you make of that matchup?
did you see how he celebrated the win?
yeah.
does he deserve his mad dog nickname?
what's the craziest thing you've seen him do then?
i have been talking to a bunch of teenagers in the draw here, and there are nine girls in the women's draw but only two in the men, and one was a wildcard. i was wondering, why do you think the girls are doing better than the guys in terms of at a younger age? do you have any thoughts on that?
clay hasn't been your strongest surface over the years, but this year in rome you pushed rafa very close, you were close to winning against him. how much confidence would you take coming into the tournament with that performance? do you think that you need to make many changes in your game to be more competitive on clay as compared to hard court where you're at your best?
i saw you practiced with dominic thiem the other day. what do you think of him, and how do you rate his chances against rafa?
this was your first match in a grand slam. three hours and 46 minutes. that's a good start.
what about this first round in a grand slam tournament? lots of emotions. i suppose you're already 23, but were there ups and downs, moments when you doubted?
during the second set you missed two set points. did you think, okay, maybe that's a missed opportunity?
that was a special moment for you. was that your family in the public? friends, perhaps?
and you looked at the crowd or not during the match? you were in your bubble?
physically how do you feel now?
what about these transition years that are difficult? when you were really a young player you were really strong, and then when you started playing on the tour. what's happened? i think you had many injuries. what's happened? how come that you have not really won any matches earlier here?
a few words about where you practice, with whom, etcetera?
what about the wildcard? as usual, some people said it was not fair. is this a revenge for you, or don't you care at all?
now, for those who don't know you, never seen you play, what would you say about this match? did you like it? is it really your game? your personality? you're a fighter with ups and downs?
the celebration, did you have it long planned?
talk about that relief. 13 goes. did you get to a point where you thought, i'm just not going to bother with the bloody grand slams; i'll win all my other matches.
when you saw the draw, did you think that maybe it was the right time? at the australian open you had a much tougher draw; here it looked like it was more, i don't know, accessible for you.
how sort of heavy had that burden become for you? talk about that.
what did you think when he was 51 up in the fourth? were you kind of thinking, here we go again?
you mentioned a sort of mental toughness you had in matches this year. do you think there is something that's clicked or something you've done differently?
andy was saying that he enjoys being around you in the locker room. you're a lot of fun. how hard is it to keep the fun going when you felt thislike, oh, gosh, they're winning, and they must be thinking, is he ever going to win one of these matches? is it just something in you that motivates you?
and the fun part of you?
what did woody say to you after?
how do you feel about the next one?
you must feel like going into a game like that that there is a huge sort of weight lifted off your shoulders. do you feel like you can be pretty dangerous at this point?
i know you don't like the mad dog nickname. i think andy murray said he thinks it's a good one. have you kind of accepted it now?
do you think you could maybe embrace it like it's a good thing for you, or you just want to forget about that?
i think it's a great nickname. why don't you like it?
do you have nickname?
what would you like then?
isn't it just fun and people can identify with you maybe because of that on the court? people get behind you more.
copyright it now, surely.
andy said you and he joke around a bit. have you known him for a long time?
you played well in the first set, but you were not able to keep that level in the next sets.
how do you feel and how your body is reacting? how many seasons do you feel you have left in you?
talking to venus williams, and you and her having similar generations in terms of when you come up on the tour. she was saying she still, even though results haven't been quite the same as they were ten years ago, still goes into every tournament thinking she can win and you can catch lightning in a bottle on some level. do you still think that when you show up to, maybe not the french, but when you get to wimbledon in three weeks that things can click and magic can still happen?
one question about your davis cup teammate, tomic, he's playing now, but i think he's lost the first two sets quickly. just your thoughts on his season and progress and what you think the near future will hold for him.
you two carry yourselves very differently. you have a lot more visible sort of fire when you play. is it hard for you to relate to him almost and his mode of operating as being pretty much 180 from yours?
what's the biggest thing you take out of a match like today looking ahead to the next phase of the season?
a question about football. do you follow soccer?
can you give me a quick outlook on the socceroos for the world cup? what do you think they can do?
can you give me a result prediction for australia versus holland?
and the results?
by three goals?
are you happy with how you started the tournament?
coming back to a place where you made the final last year, what kind of emotions do you have coming here?
in montecarlo you beat rafael nadal for the first time in ten years on clay. so how do you feel about your chances of winning this tournament and also looking forward to your match with rafa? what do you feel are your chances?
but what do you feel are your chances to winning the tournament? how are you feeling about that?
when a lot of upsets happen in the beginning of the tournament, wawrinka, nishikori, dimitrov today, is it easy to block this and not look around it? or will you look at it and think there is more opportunity for you?
some people were saying that maybe rafa coming into this tournament is a little bit more vulnerable than maybe previous years. what do you think? you're close to him. you played him. you beat him. what's your opinion on that?
this is a bit offbeat, but there are a lot of former players who are now coaches and they are around the locker room and players lounge. is there anyone in particular? i mean, there's becker, bruguera, all these players, michael chang. is there anyone in particular you're happy to bump into or did you speak to any of these explayers?
would you say that it was easier than you thought, or is it because there is a storm on the chatrier court, and the storm is you?
tell us more about the 30yearold players. you're one of those. why would you say that you're still there on the courts? whereas for the younger players, it's more difficult, more difficult for them to reach this level. maybe you have the technical staff or teams with you that no longer exist?
yesterday wawrinka talked a lot about the mental aspect. he said this is the big difference between him and the best players like djoko and nadal. would you say the same? would you say they're different from the other players thanks to this mental thing that they have?
now, if we look at today, today is a bit cold, the weather conditions are poor, people are a bit bothered. what do you do to survive?
you have said that the economic crisis has perhaps had a negative impact and has slowed down all of the youngest players in spain. could you perhaps tell us more about the crisis in spain in general.
and what do you think about this?
back to tennis. not long ago in rome it was 3all, 030 against djokovic, and then you won. you defeated rafa, as well. so you're not that far, are you?
now, i have a question that is not connected to tennis but football. which are your favorite football teams for the world cup?
were you surprised with karlo and dimitrov's results?
tough luck today. can you talk about the match and what kind of difficulties you felt you were facing?
how tough is it mentally going out there, knowing that this is a guy who can pretty much shut you down if he plays great and you don't play out of your head?
against a guy like that, particularly getting broken puts you in a big hole. what were you feeling when you were broken in each of those first two sets? did you have trouble getting back whatever energy you did have?
you mentioned you had a good clay court season. coming in as the no.11 seed, did you feel you had a lot of pressure or put a lot of pressure on yourself or was it coming from outside?
you said you didn't have the best couple of days the past couple of days? anything particular you want to share?
you met him a couple of weeks ago in rome, and then he had a pretty good run in dusseldorf. did you feel he was playing more confidently or any differently today than when you were playing him before?
you know, you're disappointed, i'm sure, but you don't sound too down on yourself, so i'm wondering if that's because of the opponent, because karlovic is such a unique animal or you just don't want to get done and start to lose your confidence?
are you going to stay on in paris for a little bit? what are your plans for the grass season?
are you going to stay back in paris?
you mentioned that you had a difficult couple of days. was there anything that meant you were not fully 100% today?
tough luck today.
can you talk about the match and how you were feeling on the court.
how much did nerves or pressure play into that performance?
what are some of the things that are different? this is your first slam playing as a slam champion. how does that change your mindset or your preparation at all?
is that something that you've talked much to roger about, sort of how to deal with the process of becoming a big favorite like that?
did it take you by surprise at all in the beginning of the match or was it more about you not finding your game?
how big of a disappointment is this for you? were you expecting a lot from yourself this fortnight?
when you talk about the puzzle and trying to put it together, are you talking about like goal setting, like now you've won a slam, you've won a masters, knocked off a lot of goals i presume you had? is that what kind of the mental issue is?
there seemed to be a couple of points where you were close to swinging a set, like you got a few breaks, break point opportunities, but you ended up losing the game. did you feel like you were close to flipping it a little, or did you just feel like you didn't have the answers?
physically you felt okay, or was something...
you were talking about confidence when you spoke in english. you talked about a puzzle. do you think what happened in madrid and rome with regards to your preparation can explain the bad feelings during this match today?
when you walked on the court today, did you feel 100% ready mentally and physically?
i know it's difficult, but for an outsider seeing you making so many mistakes, what's going on in your head for everything to go wrong?
what did magnus tell you before, during, and after the match?
you're obviously very disappointed, but you're still smiling. does it mean that at this stage in your career you can step back and take it calmly?
you said you are not at the level of djokovic, nadal, federer. does it mean that you understand the pressure they can feel when they walk on big tournaments year after year?
have you digested australia?
you're not back to the level you had in australia? are you afraid you might never get back to that level?
how many positives can you take out of that despite the defeat with how we would well you played at times? in periods?
long periods.
rain delay after the first set. your momentum was going nicely then. just kind of at the wrong time, i guess.
did you think that you should have stopped for longer before the third? you looked a little bit unsure about starting again when it was raining.
i wonder when you think you struck the ball as consistently well as you did today throughout the whole match?
do you feel after this you'll be hoping that you sort of forge on towards the top 100? do you feel you're sort of finally ready to make that step now?
did you have any friends or family out here watching you?
are there particular things that you've done well this week which you put down to the new coaching partnership?
dropshot early on was very good. that's a real clay courter's tactic, isn't it?
what's next for you?
you mentioned about your world ranking. do you have a particular target?
when you were saying you had the chance to be 130, 140.
during such a match, what would you say is the most difficult thing to manage? is it the rotten weather conditions or the opponent? well, i thought at the beginning of the match you could beat him easily.
you wanted to finish today?
would you say by that you could appraise your level of game, or is it a totally atypical match?
you had a good week in nice. what about this roland garros tournament for you?
now, the fact to be relaxed, have you talked about it already? you know, nadal's match in rome, was that a key match as far as that is concerned?
i have a question from the fans, from roland garros.com. a question for you. they are asking for your confirmation concerning your usual habit to eat the chocapic, bowls full of chocapic in your bedroom. can you tell us more about that?
new caledonia, you won in 2005, 2006, these internationals over there and the caledonians are certain that your career started that year. then there was melbourne, three rounds, what would you say? don't disappoint them.
with or without racquets, will you go back there one day?
(in english.) last week alize cornet was a little bit upset because she was playing in strasbourg and she got booed from the crowd. i know that can be a problem for the french players sometimes at roland garros. do you find that sometimes the crowd can be a bit demanding?
(in english.) how about matches in the past?
(in french.) do you have the impression there is less pressure on you than in the past in roland? is it an advantage, would you say?
i'd like to know about twitter, something about twitter. what about twitter?
are you not interested at all in twitter?
(off microphone.)
looking back, do you regret that maybe it was too risky to come or it was nothing really to do with the injury today?
you fought so hard in the tiebreaker. if you had won that tiebreaker, do you think the result would have been different?
have you any ongoing problems with your recent injuries that you're aware of during the matches?
you look really down. but to change a little bit the subject, when you see the match is postponed because of the weather, which kind of things do you do? do you rather like listen to music, do you visualize the match? what kind of routines do you have when you have extra time before the match?
there was a lot of momentum this year for your progress, you were making great progress. how does these injuries set you back? and how do you see the rest of the season progress now?
what is it like working with michael, and what are the two or three things you like the most or have learned the most from him?
can you say specifically what some, the two or three things he's worked on your game with?
a question about football. what do you expect of japan in the world cup and who is your favorite for the world cup?
and your favorite?
for winning the world cup.
how does it feel to get the first one over with, rafa?
difficult conditions sitting in the locker room wondering if it's going to rain or stop? how did you handle that?
i know we don't know who your next opponent is, but can you just talk about mathieu or dominic thiem?
last year the first couple of rounds for you were a bit tricky. are you feeling kind of relieved or confident this time your first round was not like...
this is not strictly related to roland garros, but how would you describe your relationship with your racquet?
yes. how do you feel with it? and what does it represent with you?
some people were a bit surprised that you were scheduled on suzanne lenglen today. i was wondering if it made any difference to you. were you expecting to play on chatrier, or you didn't really care?
you did come to the net a few times today like when i was watching match. do you feel that consciously do you need to go more to the net specifically against tough opponents in the later rounds, maybe almagro, ferrer, and djokovic perhaps?
first round is past for you, first round past for novak. who do you think is favorite right now, you or novak?
are you satisfied with the result today? are you happy with the way you moved on the court?
can you tell us the whole process in madrid, in rome? your confidence came back. you're more competitive. is it because you played quite a lot?
are you as nervous for the other tournament as you are here?
you were telling us about your concerns in montecarlo. has this disappeared? and can you tell us about the final of the champions league?
coming back to madrid, you said that berdych was hitting his balls very high and that you had difficulties returning and you also complained about the sun, the lack of sun, about the cold.
congratulations.
you lost? okay. so what happened out there?
no, i didn't. i was told that you won. i'm sorry.
you already talked about the conditions. the match was interrupted because of the rain. how did you experience this? was it tougher for you than for your opponent? how did you manage to manage the conditions?
unfortunately you lost the match, so we're not going to have a remake of your match against john isner. i would like to know whether in this match you felt that you could have played him in the second round, and what was your reaction when you found out you wouldn't?
you talked to the referee. what did you talk about?
in the fourth set we felt your opponent wasn't too well physically. he seemed to have signs of strain on his face. did you see that? did you think, maybe if i can come back into the fifth set i might win it?
what about your frustration? all the efforts you made to play on this surface and year not being rewarded, is that part of the frustration?
plans for the future?
well, i have an idea.
well, grass.
queen's?
wimbledon.
'shertogenbosch?
newport?
at least somebody is listening.
congratulations. two questions: did you know about kei has been injured and what kind of injury it was before the match? second question is maybe the first set, you know, in the tiebreak maybe was the key of this match. after that first set, did you feel you got more confident and you started playing well?
i think you and kei are the same age. how do you see the progress of kei this year?
question related to what he asked. so you are same generation as kei, and there is raonic and dimitrov coming up and making progress, which is called like a younger, upandcoming generation. do you feel like the success of kei or dimitrov or raonic, the success of them encourages you? do you feel like you can do the same thing they can do?
martin, during the match, did you feel something about he has some problem or some problem with movement, or you were just focused?
what did you think when you saw your draw after doing so well and getting a wildcard and seeing you got nadal first round?
does he look to you like a guy in a slump?
does his ball come off the court differently than other guys? is he hitting the ball in a way you haven't seen before?
pretty deep into the third set you were playing a scramble point and doing pretty well up at the net; you guessed right and hit a flick dropshot. certain winner. then he returns it to score his winner. what goes through your head when you go through exchanges like that?
basic locker room question. didn't have a chance to see whether you've played federer or not, but if you had federer and nadal, say, in a slow or medium hard court, best of alltime, which way do you go? what can you say?
isner said you got up early the other day to practice on chatrier. i guess you were not the only one surprised by the court placement.
you were in the second set. you had that one terrible game with four huge errors, i believe. was that just a lapse of concentration? too much focus? you need a break? what?
you've played a lot of these tournaments and you've also been playing in some lowertiered tournaments. is it hard to make that transition?
what's the plan the next few weeks?
obviously it's tough times for our tennis. what are your thoughts on what we can do to sort of kick it up and try and get to a higher level?
last guy to reach the fourth round here. do you think that can be done this year?
you talked about beating rafa on clay as one of the toughest things in sports. can you think of anything else that's as tough?
tough match. i would like to know, well, you called several times to the doctor, the trainer. what happened?
facundo started pretty well and you regained your strength and you kept your game going on, so you won the third and fourth set. in the fifth, you based your game on your serve, right? what do you think was the key to try to win the game?
after such a match, i mean, that's the first fiveset match you lost that's not the first fiveset match you lose here. so you're used to long matches, big fights. what do you feel right now?
this is the longest match in your career. did you know that?
i don't know if it adds anything to this. you're talking about the match and the context. i will ask a question about your coach. does it have an impact?
would you say that this was the most tiring game or match in your career?
you were talking about your opponent's game level. was it a surprise knowing that this player had never played a grand slam before?
you played quite a few matches in five sets. can you tell us what will go through your mind when it lasts so long? in the end, i guess there is a lot of pressure. we can't see that when we watch you playing, but i guess there must be some pressure.
it's a question about basketball. did you see jalt was playing the playoffs?
are you interested? will you have time to watch them next week?
feel good to get a win under your belt at a slam?
not being a guy who likes clay lot, too, so how did you feel out there?
how is your injury in houston and the recovery?
what were the expectations coming in here after the spring?
john said a minute ago about he thought you were punching well below your weight here. so do you feel the same way, and what do you need to do to get things clicking again?
with your experience now, how do you handle looking at the ranking? you know what you've been and could be, and then there is that number. how do you approach it?
so this may sound like an obvious question, but you've played some pretty close matches this year that you've lost this year. closing it out, crunch time, is that a confidence thing or is there anything else you look back on that might have undermined you?
there are a lot of changes on the horizon for player development centers in america. you spent i believe some time at carson. talk about the facility there. did you play a lot of matches or was it sort of one off or just talk about that.
so it's a net plus?
talk about your movement and footwork in particular as a big guy, how important that is and how you've worked on your footwork.
in general.
you were american no.1 i think about a year ago, give or take. what was that experience like for you looking back? was it tough shouldering the burden of it more than you expected or less?
what's your reaction to rafa being on lenglen tomorrow to kickoff the tournament?
in the first set you faced a few break points and you saved them almost exclusively with big serves and you served very well throughout the match. you didn't seem to be afraid to come into the net when you had some short balls. in the past, was there a hesitation on your part to come to the net on short balls?
i don't know how much you've heard about the new center that the usta is planning in orlando, but i guess it's going to be one of the largest facilities anywhere. hundred courts. everything but grass. they are hoping to attract talented juniors and top pros to come down there and utilize the facilities. comments or thoughts on that?
after working with david when he was in the usta, what is your take overall on the development program and how they've done?
i knew you worked with david, but did higueras ever come by and talk to you or help out at all?
his best strength as a coach was?
i think the prevailing opinion now is not to have that many kids boarding there, but to have them come through with their own coaches and stuff. thoughts on that concept?
do you think in general americans should be satisfied with where the pro men's level is right now overall for the u.s. guys?
what was your reaction when you saw that you would be playing roger in the first round?
you've played roger before; today were you surprised by his game and surprised by how many times he came to the net?
what do you think about his level? do you think he's still able to win grand slam tournament?
do you think he can do it here at the french open?
one question personally: you make it through the draw quite often, but have had a lot of firstround defeats this year. it's hard for you, i guess, right? how do you get along with this?
is the seeding still fair, the system of the seeding?
nice match.
that kid had never played a grand slam match. what did you think?
how tough is it when there is 10,000 people that really, really want him to win?
you obviously have played a lot of sec team sports, north american sports, whatever. do you wish there was more sort of a homeandaway aspect to tennis always? most of the time you're playing people in essentially like a neutral venue. and do you sort of wish you had more of the good and bad and both ways?
what tournament do you think offers the biggest home court advantage?
three tight sets but three sets nonetheless. you have had some long matches here, couple five setters last year. talk about getting through these early rounds, the energy.
are you playing doubles here?
tomorrow's schedule came out and rafa is on lenglen. i don't need to tell what you his record is here. how does that strike you?
what would your advice be to robby?
sorry to use the n word, but got nicolas mahut possibly on the horizon. what's the most bizarre incident you've had postmatch or strangest question or relating to nicolas in the marathon match that you had?
speaking of robby, i think the last u.s. guy to get to the second week, i think it was like four years ago. you talked before the season about how you needed to be aggressive, you needed to win in straight sets in early rounds. for you, being as big as you, how absolutely crucial is that?
just wanted to ask physically, how are you doing at this tournament? your knee, you had some tape and some talk about a back injury, as well. no?
could you just give me your idea on the state of american men's tennis at the moment.
what do you think about the new tennis center that the usta is planning for orlando? do you think it's a good idea? i mean, it looks like most of the better players are usually the players that come out of their hometown with, you know, coaches there and stuff.
no, they are just starting it. it will be like a hundred courts. there won't be any grass, but it will basically be the home of they are moving out of boca when it's built. i think there will still be a minor presence in carson.
college tennis was mentioned a little while ago. obviously you played for many years. could you just your collegiate rival, usc, has been an incredible run. can you comment on that run? what are your thoughts?
you talked about home court advantages on the tour. could you compare all those, murray's wimbledon and french players here. could you compare that to athens and uga, how does the athens home court compare?
i'm wondering, as somebody who chose college, if a junior, who is kind of trying to decide about going out on the tour and going in the futures or choosing college and asked your advice, what kind of advice would you tell them to help make that decision either way?
i just wanted to you talked about playing on clay. you're the biggest guy on the tour. talk to me about how important footwork is out there.
wondering how, you talking about wanting to play better, having done better in the u.s., how would you evaluate this swing for you so far?
what's the highest you think you've ever been able to kick your second serve? can you bounce it over a standard fence on a tennis court?
tennis alone doesn't give you happiness, but how much happier are you today with your game and with your life?
you get to play one of two qualifiers next. i was wondering if you knew much about them, schwartzman or elias. if you don't know much about them, how would you prepare for a match like that?
you have been working with edberg. can you talk about your work with him and how is it progressing and whether you have done anything special for this tournament.
you played against slovak opponent. your wife has slovak background. do you speak any slovak? we know your great language skills.
first match of a tournament on a big stadium like that, at a grand slam, you have done it a million times. is there still a bit of a rush? how would the rush be different here in chatrier than maybe some of the other grand slam main stadiums.
considering rafa's results this spring and some of the things he's said about his own confidence, how vulnerable do you feel like he is here?
he's talked about his own confidence issues this spring a little bit.
i believe you had practiced a bit with nick kyrgios in zurich recently. can you just talk about his game and what strengths he has and what kind of potential you think he has?
you spoke about rafa, but what about novak? i mean, do you think from what you've seen, everything the last six weeks, that novak is the justifiable favorite here now for this event?
i wanted to ask you a question sort of what tom asked. you're known for your calm and your confidence, but talk about your nerves over the years. when were you most nervous? as a junior for the orange bowl? what big tournament? wimbledon final? when were you most nervous? how did you deal with it?
goran has talked about his handshaking at match point, andy murray talked about that, also. at match point have you had sort of a high anxiety?
you moved so well today and you were very focused and very healthy, but you mentioned the atmosphere. do these flying cameras ever distract you?
there was once in australia in january where, they come much closer to the court there?
you looked irritated in australia when you were changing shirts and the spidercam came right down to you and you sort of glared at it. do you remember that?
could you talk about just quickly the fact of playing on a sunday, starting a grand slam on a sunday? you have played on sundays before here. is it something you like? is there a reason or...
in three weeks the soccer cup will start, the football cup. i know you love football. are you going to follow the matches? can you talk more about la nati and more precisely the match against france?
(off microphone.)
back to tennis, what about your feelings? i had the impression you had good feelings today. what do you think about the chatrier court this year and the clay?
about your match in france, it's a good start to whet your appetite, to start roland garros this way?
would you feel that your draw is "affordable" or, i mean, can you make it? what do you think about your draw here?
what do you think about the fact that we postpone wimbledon due to the fact that it's too close after roland garros?
back to nadal that you mentioned before. you said it's unfair that is the criticisms against his game or play. why would you say he's at the same level? why would you say that? why do you say that? or do you believe in him?
it's a bit as if there were two matches today. 53 and set ball for him, and you saved this set ball at the net and then you won three games straight. how do you analyze that?
you were quite strong on your serve all along the match.
it's going to be a rainy day tomorrow, apparently, so it was important for you to finish tonight.
second round i guess you have seen who you might be playing in the second round. what do you think about it?
do you have any idea, by the way, you tried many different things against him, do you think about a solution?
amongst the top players, is he the one that's the most difficult for you to play because of your style?
you think he's the strongest. would you say he's the favorite? he's stronger than nadal?
talking about this day, alize was playing earlier today. we saw you watching her play on the screen. did you manage to enjoy her game?
what can you say about the match?
what did you know about him before the match?
there is quite a lot of rain expected this week. mentally, what would you do to make sure that it doesn't affect you and stay focused?
did you know that his an ancestry is czech, peter?
playing on a sunday, to start on a sunday, what do you think about that for you and for the fans? is it a good thing?
sorry, for players it's a big difference because, like you said, you get to days off. is that something good or something bad?
i'm sure you get asked about your fashion sense a lot. can we talk about your tshirt this time and what kind of thought went into it. did they come up and you had to approve it? how did you decide to wear it?
can you talk about how you go about planning out your schedule for the whole year, how far in advance you commit to tournaments and plan?
can i ask you about winstonsalem? is it on the schedule this year?
where do you think that match was decided tonight?
do you think it's just confidence? is that something that confidence can do in those big moments?
were you happy with the indoor conditions?
what was the problem when you went off for treatment at the end of the first set?
for many players, they might find it a little difficult playing in asia with the culture, food, language difference. you played fantastic in asia this year. does that make asia a more enjoyable place for you in the future maybe?
obviously you played roger in 2008, round robin masters cup in shanghai. apart from the result, what was the difference?
as a french player, do you think you are romantic as for the ladies here? i wonder, how does your character affect your match?
can you tell us the difference between playing roger when he was younger and playing roger now?
what did you write on the camera besides roger federer?
you won in the masters cup twice in shanghai before, this time was the masters series. considering where you are right now in your career, does that give you extra satisfaction to win here this year?
it was 2005. i want to correct you.
i'm sure. i was here.
you were in houston.
it was 2005, the 3rd of october. i remember that day.
i know the year is not over yet, but can you put your year in perspective up to this point. haven't gotten a major, but two backtoback masters, back up to no.2. how are you feeling overall?
is no.1 in the world your goal for the end of the year?
gilles was saying over the course of the years that he's played you, one thing he's noticed is that maybe nowadays you're a little bit more inclined and willing to change tactics mid match. maybe earlier you wanted to impose and win the way you wanted to win. what are your thoughts on that? if that is true, what would you say is the change? experience, maturity, technical?
how different a player do you think you are now compared with two years ago? i'm thinking in particular of how much you want to come forward now and get to the net.
you are such a complete player. i'm wondering whether there's any part of your game you wish was better?
over the course of your career.
do you like the shape of the trophy? could you describe it in your own words? what is the most beautiful trophy in your whole career?
a question about the world tour finals. novak said the other day that he would like to see, after the london deal has finished, the tournament move elsewhere, to another city somewhere in the world. i wonder if you have an opinion on that.
you have a long history with this city. some players said the chinese people or shanghai people created or developed a certain culture of tennis in their own style of loving tennis. what are your feelings about it?
i believe novak or somebody else.
their own style, chinese style of loving tennis.
back to the o2. have you ever been there for anything other than tennis?
never seen a concert there or anything like that?
this tournament had already won five times in a row for the best atp 1000. did you vote for shanghai or will you vote for shanghai? what makes shanghai so outstanding or special?
it's the third time you make it to the semis in shanghai, but also the third time you lost. how do you feel about this kind of situation? do you feel lucky or unlucky?
were you a little bit surprised at how well he served? you didn't get one breakpoint chance in the entire match.
next week you will go back to world no.14 or 15. how do you feel about this? this is your best ranking in your whole career.
novak said in all the matches you played, that is quite possibly the best you ever played against him. what were your feelings on the match?
there is a chinese proverb saying, if you can survive very tough situations at the beginning, you will probably be rewarded finally. the first match looks like an illusion to you now?
does it feel like you're playing with house money after what happened in the opening match? does that relax you at all, give you confidence? how does that sort of escape play with your psyche?
you've been competing with novak and rafael for so many years. what do you think is the biggest joy or fun when you're competing with these two guys?
you went to the net a lot today, which was effective. was that in the plan when you walked on the court?
do you already know if you will play the tournament in bercy? this year you will play the final of davis cup. what does it change maybe in your schedule or way to prepare for the end of the season?
your last loss to simon came six years ago also here in shanghai. how do you avoid a letdown tomorrow after a big win like this tonight?
you have an amazing ability to snap novak's streaks. there was 2011 at the french, now this. is there an extra edge that goes into those matches, extra piece of motivation?
you met roger on a very good night. your thoughts on the match.
did you feel it from the first game, first ball, that he was just striking it well today?
it looked like you were getting obviously frustrated through the match. is that because you felt you couldn't execute or because he was too good and there was nothing you could do?
when roger plays like that, do you feel he's playing as well as he has ever played?
all streaks have to end at some point. 28 matches you won in a row in china. your reflections on that?
what is your impression of him as a 33yearold player? has he done something that surpasses your imagination? what do you talk about federer in the locker room?
did his performance surpass your imagination for a man aged 33?
did you see the fans in the stands and what they did for you? do you have something to tell to them? and what is your plan for the next two weeks?
that was an excellent result against somebody that's right in the race for london. has that been the sort of tennis you've been playing over the last few weeks? do you wish you'd been playing that a bit more of late?
when was the last time you defeated two top10 players in one tournament?
in shenzhen i remember you lost in the first round. in tokyo and here you played better and better. how do you find your form in asia?
another test of your memory. when was the last time you beat a top10 player 60 in the deciding set?
not sure it happened at all before?
what was going on on court in that final set? do you think tomas was tired or injured? did you just up your game?
another question about numbers. berdych has a very huge serve. how did you manage to have 12 breakpoints?
your recent form has been so good that you've been moving up the rankings, beating two top10 players this last week. is it a goal of yours to get back into the top 10?
talking about goals for the end of the season. i would imagine a great goal for you would be to get one of the single's places in the davis cup final. is that a possibility?
what is your feeling with this big win, making it through to the semifinals?
what was going through your mind when he broke back? doublefaults, but you managed to refocus quickly in the next game.
you play gilles simon in the semifinals. talk about him.
obviously you're very happy with your form this week. has it been kind of strange leading an almost nocturnal existence?
two apiece with novak this year.
last one was wimbledon, first one was dubai. what are your thoughts going into this one?
at this point playing novak, do you know everything he's going to be throwing at you and vice versa or is there something new you think you can bring to the table tomorrow?
new physio with you this week. can you talk about the reason for the change, is it permanent, the details of that decision.
can you talk about tonight's match a little bit. is that the best you felt on court this week? especially the second set, you didn't make many errors.
your friends have a new creation today. they are holding the marvel heroes. which one is your favorite and which do you think looks like you?
slight discussion with the umpire early on this the match. what are your thoughts on that rule? does it need to be enforced where you challenge immediately? should it be a bit more lax?
how did you think you played today? a little bit of a tough time serving out the first set, but otherwise do you feel good about it?
i have seen in many victories you sign on the camera writing words in chinese. what is the meaning of that?
your streak in china, is it something that you think about, or is it something that is made up to be a streak that we write about? is it illusory or something you think about?
roger is ahead in his match right now. assuming he wins, could you talk a little bit about your rivalry this year. this year you have split your matches. why do you think this year you've been so closely matched? and playing in china, do you feel you have some kind of a psychological edge given your recent success here?
a question about the world tour finals. there will be a decision i think in march or april about where it will be held next. there's a lot of talk that maybe it will stay in london. do you think it should stay in london or do you think it's important to take the tournament around the world?
the likes of you, roger, rafa, we hope andy, you're all europeans. if that tournament were changed to somewhere like south america or back here into the far east after you played bercy, would that present a problem for you guys?
i know you've beaten rafa on clay, but is hard court the fairest surface?
every time you come to china, you write down different words in chinese. how many chinese letters can you write? do you remember them?
that one break of serve seemed to change the momentum of the entire match. was that how you saw it?
do you feel that's possibly the best he's played against you, that last set and a half?
looking at the match, do you chalk this up as a good day for david or was there more you thought you could do?
what is your take away over the last few weeks in asia? how do you think you can build on this run going into the next season, into australia?
i take that to mean you might be contemplating valencia, basel?
it seems like you played much more stable compared to yesterday. is it because you managed to adjust your form or because martin klizan's strategy proved to be more challenging for you?
how much are you thinking about the atp world tour finals in london? are you playing each match with this in mind, that it's a goal for you?
i was checking hawkeye graph, and it seems that your shots were not landing as deep as usual. what do you think of your performance?
when you got the break back in the second set, you celebrated, you were pumped up. was there a little bit of relief at that point because of the frustration of how you had been playing up till that point in the second set?
next is david ferrer. can you talk about that match, what you expect him to bring.
a few days ago in beijing you said you had one of your best match performances, beating tomas berdych. what prevents you from doing the same thing here in this match? is that because of the opponent? is that because of yourself, tiredness?
your winning streak here in china is amazing. is there something that motivates you when you're in trouble, the winning streak?
what was today's chinese character? is it hard to remember these strokes after a long match like that?
stan, you had everything under control, and all of a sudden you saw yourself a break down. what happened in that third set?
it was cooler, especially towards the end of the match. did it affect your game?
obviously not the results you were looking for in asia the past two weeks. how would you rate your play overall and what do you think the problems have been?
can you tell us a little bit about the difference you feel between yesterday and today.
you said yesterday you had an international coach who has great international experience. what strategy did he advise for you?
you said you like del potro's style. you look so much slimmer than him. will you work out more in the gym?
for every exam there needs to be a grade. for you, i this week, how will you summarize it?
i'd like to ask what was your target at the beginning of the season? and after yesterday's win, do you think you are getting any closer to the target you set for yourself?
now that you have a higher ranking than last year, will you have more expectations for next year?
other than 45 ranking points, you earned some big bonus money. it should be the most you earned. do you have any plans for it?
the executive chairman of the atp in his press conference said some players stay within the local system too long, get too comfortable. what do you think?
we always find that some chinese players could focus to win one or two matches, but you cannot win more than a couple times. why is that? do you think that's the biggest barrier stopping you from becoming a top 100 player? now there are two categories. one is a professional team, the other is a paraprofessional team. sometimes i heard like the beijing team sends you over to practice in spain for a month once a year. do you like that arrangement? do you want to stay overseas?
and about the paraprofessional team, can you tell us a little bit about the training support for you. for example, what support are you entitled to in the beijing team? for example, how many months are you entitled to train overseas?
how was your serve today? do you think maybe in the future serving will be your strong point?
there is some feedback saying that fognini hit you after you shook hands. do you think he deliberately did that? you know him very well.
previously we talked about zhang ze or wu di about the strength and energy level of a player. it's about bestofthree or bestoffive. if it's bestoffive, you consume a lot of energy. for example, kei has a good endurance. he always wins in the fourth or fifth set. how about you? how do you look at your personal endurance? do you think you are wellequipped to play bestoffive?
talk about how you're feeling. we saw you get treatment on your back during the match. also, was this just a lot of tennis in the last two weeks? were you feeling a little run down?
what did jack do particularly well tonight?
what is your game plan now? will you go back to japan, back to the states, europe?
you're going to play bercy? you're not playing any tournaments before bercy?
how do you feel now?
did you feel the two days in bed earlier this week caused you to lose some power tonight? did you feel weaker in any way?
can you tell us how it affected your play tonight.
rafa, as you said yesterday, you were hoping today you would feel better, then you would be able to get on the court. is it correct to assume that you feel better today than you felt yesterday physically?
you were complaining about the ball last week in beijing. what do you think of the balls that are used here? do they take topspin as much as you want?
you said yesterday you thought that you will need an operation. have you thought more about when you might have that?
do you think that will mean you will not play again this year?
do you mean that you will continue your schedule and keep on playing, or you will change your schedule and take some rest? what is your plan for the days after shanghai?
when you served for the second set, there were guys on the stand yelling out. were you disrupted by them?
you said your condition was almost the same as it was yesterday. does that mean you're still in some pain, a little bit of pain, still?
just thoughts on that match. much different than the one you guys had last week.
as you progress through the draws the last few weeks, are you looking at the atp tour standings at all? are you cognizant of where you are with regards to other players?
i was wondering if you remember the first time that you came to china, what that experience was like, and how your relationship with china has changed over the course of your career.
looking ahead, looking at the iptl, mindsetwise for you in terms of agreeing to play it, do you see that as a competitive event or is it the same as if you were to agree to go to an exhibition in south america? how do you think about it?
you have quite a difficult draw in your next match and the one after. does your previous success in shanghai give you any confidence going into these games?
you've played david a lot, obviously. what is the key for you in that match tomorrow?
quite the escape. another big one. talk about the match, how you think you were able to pull it out.
taking time off after davis cup, did you feel it in this first match back?
something you want to say to your fans?
we understand you're going to move to no.2 when it's next adjusted. that's another achievement from a great year you've had. what would you comment about that?
you sound congested. are you feeling okay healthwise?
the schedule is good for the fans that they put you the latest match every day. probably it's not good for you to be put in the last match every day.
can you talk about how you played out there today. what did you think of your form? what did you think about your opponent, since you didn't play him before?
what about your own performance and also the difference in the conditions from beijing to here?
when you return to a venue where you've had success, does it feel extra special when you walk out onto that same court? do the memories come back from a year ago?
you talked about your first masters cup. how does it feel growing up with a new tournament?
just a fun one. i understand you said a few words in chinese after your beijing win.
tell us about that. are you planning on learning some language?
before this competition, did you have confidence? how much confidence did you have? do you think you would have won and how did you prepare?
so you do have an international coach, is that right? could you say a little bit about this coach and what technique did your coach teach you?
i heard that your coach has worked with you for a year and you've seen some significant improvement within that period. can you elaborate on what benefits he brought to you specifically?
based on our research, you were born in dalian. you live in beijing. does this coach come from funding from the beijing team, is that right?
china, the whole country, has been eagerly waiting to see the emergence of a top 100 male player. do you have a dream like that?
it's the first time for you to compete in an atp 1000 tournament. before that you played qualifications more. can you compare the differences?
have you ever seen such a big turnout of journalists before?
do you like the surface?
during the course of your growing up, is there one particular tennis player that has had a relatively big impact on you?
i think you have managed your pace well and you didn't have a big celebration after winning. does this show you are a calm person?
what do you know about your next opponent?
were you nervous going into this match against such a top player? how big is this win for you, for your career?
describe how big this win is for your career.
i wanted to ask your opinion on what the chinese men need to do specifically to improve the way the chinese women have? is it more match experience against big players? more coaches from other countries? what do you think needs to happen?
what is the highestranked player you've been able to practice with on the atp tour?
very good win for you today. but your celebration was a little bit muted, maybe not as big after beating a compatriot. was that on your mind?
what do you think was the secret today? looked like not only are you a great server, but it looked like you were returning well today.
john isner was in here before. he fired 21 aces today. you had a high number yourself. how are you finding the courts? is it playing the way you'd like it to play?
john, a good win for you today. talk about how you were able to turn it around and get that threesetter.
how has the swing through china been for you, travelwise, off court? it's comfortable, good?
how did you see the speed of the court?
do you prefer slower because the ball bounces higher?
steve has to win his firstround match first, but you could play him in the second round. your thoughts on his season, how he's been able to improve.
karlovic can always be a tricky one. what didn't you execute well on today?
last week you said you were nervous before playing your first matches since the open. have those nerves dissipated now? do you feel it's back to normal or do you still feel pressure?
what is the biggest challenge for you now, having played so well in new york? is it trying to get that consistency? everyone expects you to go deep into tournaments like this.
you have a chinese sponsor, li ning. how has that been after winning the open? have there been a lot of activities, more so than you might have had to do a couple years ago?
did you ever feel like you were able to sink your teeth into the match, get into the match, or novak just seemed to like keep you at a distance most of the day?
is your health good today? were you fine, 100%, physically fine today?
he was able to open up your backhand side on quite a few points there. did you feel it was overplayed too much to your forehand?
what kind of mood do you leave here? do you feel like you played well this week except for today? is it encouraging or are you a little disappointed?
is the back still a problem at all?
you have never won the sony open where you have a lot of fans. do you feel you have a mental pressure to win these tournaments?
a mental block to actually win it?
when you look at your overall record here, does the achievement of making the final four times overshadow any frustration about losing four finals?
you like challenges, you said many times. are you glad novak exists?
are you eager to get home?
eager?
what do you most miss from home?
congratulations on your win. even though you won indian wells, it seemed like your form today, at least from what i could tell, was much more confident and much more secure than your win over roger a couple weeks ago. was it the court, your confidence, the opponent, all of the above? what would you say to that?
was it the conditions or the opponent?
from upstairs i was watching and said, this guy cannot lose today. you were playing almost perfect. what was going through your mind when you were playing nadal and playing so good? do you also feel like, today is my day? this guy is not going to beat me?
but tell us the truth: you feel invincible? you were playing great, man.
today was the 40th match against nadal. can you elaborate a little bit about your rivalry with him?
you have won every masters title since shanghai, the atp tour championships. should we be in for another 2011 from you?
can you talk about how you were able to sort of take his movement out of the match? that usually works to his advantage.
rafa mentioned that he felt a little bit disconcerted by your game. what changed? i mean, because you guys have played each other for, you know, many times. did you vary something?
today was so exciting and challenging. would it be more challenging for you if you had the possibility to play all others from big 4 in this tournament?
we asked rafa thathe likes challenges, was he glad that you existed.
we asked rafa, he likes challenges, was he glad that you exist because he like challenges.
i'm going to ask you the same question.
you answer first (laughter). he said, no. i'm not stupid.
you won both titles with marian with you. is there a comfort level, the familiarity of his having been there for so long and everything that maybe presents a better or a more comfortable situation for you?
just that he wasn't there earlier.
i would think you have never heard of anything like this before, both semifinals having been canceled?
when did you find out about his withdrawal? it seemed like you were working really hard in practice, maybe a little bit more than normal. did you find out before?
have you ever seen thisbefore in your career, two semifinals canceled? do you remember it happening?
and can you also tell me, your matchup with djokovic a few years ago, i think he beat you seven times in a row, all finals. you really turned it around, like five out of six. can you tell what do you think the difference was? was it a matter of health or you changed something?
speaking about novak, can you look ahead to playing him in the final? what are your thoughts?
what are you happiest with in your game going into this final?
sometimes players, when they get out of the rhythm of the tournament, when they miss a match and have to wait a couple of days and go back in, it throws them off. do you see this, as missing a match today, is that going to happen to you?
so you don't think it's going to disturb you in any way?
you practiced with a local kid, stefan kozlov, today. he's the no.2 junior in the world. can you tell us how it happened and what you think of this kid out there, this young man?
how hungry are you to get your first win in miami? how much do you want this first win here in miami?
it must feel good getting through that kind of guy who gives you trouble with big serves.
milos said you had a strategic and mental disposition better than he did. did you feel that way?
milos, his serve, how tough is his serve to return? is it the toughest on tour?
do you enjoy that challenge playing against players with a big serve like that?
i was wondering, do you think getting a little more time in miami to prepare for the conditions here has helped you this week?
you have beaten tomas i think 16 times in a row. why does your game work so well against him? what do you like against his game that fits into yours?
when a guy is playing the way he was early on and you missed a few chances, do you find yourself struggling with yourself to be patient, telling yourself, well, the guy's gonna have to give me an opening sooner or later? is that a difficult thing to manage mentally?
do you find yourself struggling with yourself to be patient and calm down, telling yourself that you probably will get chances? do you have this discussion with yourself as it's going on?
yeah.
just wondering how you decided to take your shirt off on court after every match, because no other players do that.
to take your shirt off after every match on the court, because no other players do that.
we have watched so many of your matches over the years. kind of an obvious question: why do you stand back so far? is it vision, technique on your shots?
just in general.
are you ever concerned when you do that that you're going to give away that tight angle too much?
how well did you have to play today to do this win in two sets against a pretty tough opponent?
can you just look ahead to each of the next two guys, nadal or maybe raonic if you play him?
was it your consistency today that saw you through? he's so streaky.
alex is such a different player with his style and all that. is he somebody you like to play, and is he somebody that your mind has got to change on how you approach playing him?
i think this match brought you back up to no.5 in the rankings for next week. are you very attuned to the rankings or they don't mean as much to you? what's rankings value for you as a player?
i know you're not playing davis cup in the next group. do you think there is too much davis cup right now? some people talked about doing it only every other year or something like that. would you support that kind of change?
have you talked to other players about that? do you think a lot of people would support that on the players' side?
is there an understanding that i mean, the money that is earned every year from the davis cup is what the itf gives back to the game and helps grow it in all these countries all around the world. without the income every year, they're not going to be able to help these young players develop in third world nations, like a sandra samir from egypt. that's what they use the money for, or a lot of it. does that...
was it hard when you won in november and then had to already begin defending again in february? that's a very quick turnaround from end to beginning.
can you just talk a bit about this year? obviously you're having a good year and you had your longest winning streak. you've won a tournament and stuff.
you're one of the top players who are kind of like a little bit under the radar as opposed to roger or rafa. are you happy with that? just kind of doing your own business and not caring if you're getting that kind of fanfare about you?
will you watch the match tonight? and do you have a preference between milos and rafa?
obviously it seemed like a key turning point was the first point, 56, when you were serving. did you feel like he went over the net and the point should have been yours at that point?
what did the umpire say to you when you asked him?
but you were clearly angry about that, and you looked at the replay, right?
yeah. clearly it was.
so what are you most angry about?
or disappointed?
even though you thought your game is doing well, do you feel like that's going to translate when you hit the clay?
you're dipping a bit here in rankings because you are the champion. just talk about your comeback after an injury.
are you thinking about your back at all? is it affecting you at all when you play?
playing well throughout. the second set you get a break, and you came back and played a game you probably wanted to take back and play over if you could.
can you talk about what went wrong there?
compared to yesterday, how did the back feel after you had the attention on court? you seem to have seen the physio after here.
do you think maybe umpires are getting help now from hawkeye, not having to make a decision? and then something like that happens like that right in front of their eyes, which is clearly a mistake, do you think maybe it's been contributed to by the fact they don't need to be on these calls as much as they used to be?
it's clearly very good to see you back to something close to your best. are you going to go straight back to europe, or will you stay here for a day or two? what's the plan because of davis cup?
go on sunday or monday?
guess what everybody wants to talk about?
anything to add besides what you said on court? were you really unaware of the rule?
a lot of people will talk about how this affected andy and stuff, but something like that also affects a younger guy. how did it affect you?
you sensed that he was...
it's hard, though, because you're friends.
if you had been clear on the rule, would you have conceded the point?
andy knows that you have done this in the past. you did it yesterday for robredo. the fact that you're friends, i imagine he knows you'll be fair out there. did he say anything after the match? did you talk about it at all?
did you have any concerns with colder weather conditions before the match today? i wonder if that got into your mind before the match.
would you definitely prefer the hotter conditions?
yeah.
can you talk about the boost in confidence that indian wells gave you and the effect of it today?
why do you live in montecarlo instead of miami? is it because you're afraid of latin women?
because of your fiance? are you afraid of that?
i think you said on the court, can you tell us again, do you feel like the replay system should include such calls?
apart from that game, he played very well and then he broke you in the second set, and clearly you had to have some concern, yet his game, really the wheels came off in the next game. were you surprised by that?
let's say it is roger in the next round and you've only just played him in a terrific match. what would be different, if anything, going into this match against him compared to last week? would you change anything? how would you approach the match?
after the controversial point, i believe there was some type of replay shown. the crowd started booing. did you get a sense of what that was about?
no, what i meant was i was trying to figure out if they were booing about the point or if...
quarterfinal first time, and i think you won your 100th hard court. what do you make of all that?
were you a little frustrated on the first two match points? you didn't look particularly pleased.
are you a little bit beat up over the last couple of weeks? noticed that you did your left leg like the second set, kind of a funny landing and you got a whole bunch of kinesio tape on it.
your arm?
so i guess next match, nadal, fognini.
playing rafa, is he somebody that you like playing? what are the pros and cons of playing somebody like him?
when you say that he's different to anybody else, what do you mean by that?
was that as easy as it looked from the outside?
you seem more and more comfortable in the tournament. do you feel that way?
next opponent is kei nishikori. what do you think about the next matchup with him?
do you remember the first practice with him 2007?
what's his improvement?
you have played kei two times, but it's going to be the first time for you guys to play in outdoor hard court. how much do you think it affects your guys' matchup?
the surface.
hard court.
yeah.
speaking of different times, it's been a decade, 2004 i think your first match, first tournament here.
where you played against nadal. what do you think and how do you feel about that?
miami is so latin. you hear the noise here. how can you tell to latin peoples follow your career?
what is your opinion about del potro's likely to miss the rest of the season because of wrist operation?
sometimes it's tricky when you don't have to play your next opponent and you have a gap, but there is nothing tricky today with your performance and a very good win for you.
some big matches coming up with andy or tsonga. they are all tough. no disrespect to everyone else, but you could be playing roger in the semis and nadal in the big final.
at this level you guys generally don't give points to your opponent when you disagree with a call. talk about that 11 second set, important game, and you gave tommy the point.
earlier in your career you were known for impersonating other players. you stopped doing that, but i noticed lately you added a new act to your repertoire, which is impersonating media. last week in indian wells you came into dimitrov's press conference, asked him about sugarpova; that's on the light side. but on a slightly more serious side you were imitating media at the end of davis cup semifinals in serbia. you had a notebook out asking questions. you actually gave not a lecture in a stern way, but you told them a bit what you would like to see. you and [] jelena /*z have been sharing good news on twitter. i'm curious, why is good news important to you?
previewing the match, can you first talk about playing andy and then jowilly as to what the pros and cons are playing each one.
roger has 17 grand slam titles and rafa has 13. when it's all over, do you think rafa will catch him?
from a distance you could see how lendl helped andy. maybe you could expand upon that. could you also see how it could hurt him maybe right away because suddenly they just split? could be a difficult time for him, the transition?
what do you think lendl gave him that you saw on the court?
boris has tweeted this morning that the surgery went well and he expects to be on his feet very soon. when you spoke to him, what did he say?
it was a very good match for you, obviously, finishing in just under an hour. how sharp did you feel out there?
just talk about how well you played today.
i wanted to ask you about bautista and fognini, either one. can you talk about your lineup with either one?
if you could talk about your next opponent.
much smoother day today than the first one, start to finish. do you feel more comfortable today?
is it unusually hot today? even by miami standards? sort of felt it in the shade.
someone who spends a lot of time in both places, do you prefer fahrenheit or celsius?
your next match is against jo wilfried tsonga. have you seen him play in his tournament?
you talked about the heat and the humidity here. i know you train here a lot. does it take you a couple of matches, maybe a couple of sets, to kind of get used to the conditions? can you talk about that, about the heat and humidity a little bit in terms of getting accustomed to the conditions?
how are you feeling in general on court after wimbledon? does it feel any different having that huge accomplishment under your belt and sort of a weight off your shoulders? does it feel different going about your whole career right now?
is it hard to have the same hunger?
putting aside the obvious, if you were to compare wimbledon centre court, queen's centre courts, and this one, which one do you feel most comfortable on and you feel you know the best and feel most intimate in?
in your first two matches, i think you have won 90% of your first and second serve points. do you think any of that is attributable to the new racquet?
is the racquet a finished product or still a work in progress?
we have a lot of fans from latin america who are soccer fans on our website, so we were wondering, what's your view on the world cup with the group, switzerland. you're a big soccer fan, basel, real madrid. what's your take on the world cup?
in the last couple of days, rafa and novak and serena have said that they would like to go to latin america to play big events, masters events. that it's the time to go down there. do you agree with them?
fans here in miami just love you. what do you feel about that?
you have talked about your racquet as successes of late. is there something else you can pinpoint to in terms of your recent play? is that something you look on, like right now, or is that something you look on later in terms of, hey, i did this?
wondering what you have seen out of andy murray over the past few months. it's been sort of tough resultswise. as far as him winning wimbledon, do you think there is something about winning a title that's that big for him that can make it hard for him to get motivation or form right back up right away.
yeah, this year and i guess the second part of last year?
do you think it can affect your hunger to have a big result like that ever?
do you look at dubai as the place where you turned the corner and everything kind of came together, like the health and the racquet worked in and you seemed confident, obviously had great wins there?
can you just look ahead to playing gasquet in the next round, please.
(indiscernible.)
you seem to be hitting the ball with a real ferocity the last couple of sets. do you feel it was coming off really nicely?
is it a different feel at all first match without ivan? was that distracting at all?
are you in a rush to pick someone?
that's a relatively long pretty long term, though.
you gave yourself a good talking to after being broken. went through the next four games and gave yourself a little bit of a momentum there.
have you stayed in touch the last few days?
(question regarding team adidas.)
after a tough week in indian wells, do you feel towards the end of that second, third set that it was sort of coming back, the timing and confidence?
so what did you think of your match? how do you feel you played?
what kind of matchup is that for you?
yeah.
seemed like your serve kept getting better. you obviously have a great serve. just seemed to be getting better and better as the match went on.
you're ranked no.10 in the world, easily the best ranking of the u.s. players by far. can you sort of comment on the state of american tennis?
you've constantly moved up the rankings over the years. do you have any goals set?
how is your bracket doing?
it's been a tough year.
is there much interest among the players other than the americans in this thing, or what's it like around...
they don't get it, huh?
you're winning the bracket in the tennis world.
do some of them kind of scratch their heads, what's this all about?
which is harder to predict, basketball or tennis matches?
i think warren buffet would give a $1 billion anyone who can predict this tournament.
who did you follow growing up? you wanted to go into tennis?
no one?
can you talk about your serve today, first and second, and how dominant it was?
what was your decision with respect to returning when you won the toss against a big server?
have you done that before many times, particularly against him, choosing to receive when you won the toss?
there is a lot of talk in the u.s., especially this time of year, about the state of american tennis. coming from a small country and you have developed such great players like yourself and stan, what do you think the recipe is for patrick mcenroe, head of our u.s. tennis, and maybe what we should be doing to try to reestablish american tennis the way we were maybe back in the 1980s or '90s, or is that even possible? because back in those days there were 10 or 15 countries playing tennis, and now there are hundreds of countries playing tennis. what are your thoughts about that?
so do you believe that the academy system is the future, or do you think it's going to go back...
offcourt question for you. i spoke with the hair stylist at the pop up salon here, and he apparently knows exactly what he would do with your hair if you were to cut it.
i'm curious, does it make you laugh, this fascination that people seem to have with your hair and how much they care?
last year?
you have a taker.
what is it like to play ivo? what is it like to play a guy that tall with that serve?
what do you enjoy most about this venue, the sony open, this tournament?
what does 600 match wins mean to you?
after 600 wins, do you remember no.1?
has anybody called you or texted you about this huge accomplishment?
in that second set you were down 31 to robin, and then halfway through when you got those two straight games you switched shirts. was that kind of a choice, i need to change things up or trying to right something up with that shirt?
would you consider the fivegame streak kind of a turning point?
is it in the back of your mind when you're playing that you have a night session with rafa if you win? and what are your thoughts on the match coming up?
are you hungry?
we stalked to federer today, and i know he's 32 now; you're 33.
he was talking about, you know, if you take care of your body, there is no reason you can't play for a long time. can you kind of talk about how you feel about that? and also, you know, what he's done now, you know, and kept up his tennis at this age?
what keeps you motivated at this point?
when you see 600 match wins, does that give you that encouragement to say, well, let's try and put on another 100 or something?
congratulations on a solid week of play this week.
you really started to turn things around in the second set. held off a number of break points and then played an exceptional second set. what was working for you in the second set?
do you think playing backtoback 1000s as opposed to a major where you've got some rest  i know it's best of five, but you have some extra days of rest. canada and then here was a very tough field playing every day.
are you feeling confident going into the us open then?
you won a set from him last week; another today. as you mentioned, you played a very good first set as well. you feel much closer to finally being able to get him?
no, the next time you play him.
very clean match from you today. no double faults. 69% first serve percent. what worked for you out there today compared to other matches?
this hasn't been the best part of the season for you in the past, the us open series. why do you think this year has been a little better?
tomorrow either federer or raonic. talk about each of them.
how important is this week then for you to get some confidence going for the us open?
you had a tough time in finals. last i think nine finals you played i think you lost eight of them. what's been the challenging part about finals for you recently?
today was the tenth time you played julien, and he got you four times prior to that. what were you able to not allow him to do today that he had success against you with in the past?
do you feel like this is some of the best tennis you've played this year?
big advantage for you to play the day match today? the second semifinal is not until 9:00.
sort of a different question: have you ever thought about how difficult it may be to be a line judge?
like an official who calls in and out for the lines on the court.
do you think the speed of the court last week was quicker or was this week quicker?
no, last week.
congratulations on a nice run in this tournament. take us through. how happy are you to get to the semis here in cincy?
what do you think was the major difference between you guys today in today's match?
how much confidence has this week given you going into the us open?
i wanted to ask you what your favorite memory was for playing davis cup for france over your whole career?
memory, yeah.
yeah, correct.
everybody talks about your serve, but the return in today's match seemed to be the key.
i read first it's time you ever won more than 50% return points in an atp match. did it feel that way to you out there?
playing fognini he has an a lot of ups and downs and his attention span can drift in and out. do you prepare for that when you're playing him, that you know there will be peaks and valleys?
this is going to sound really silly, and it is, but the hair really stays in place the entire time. what kind of product do you use? is it like a whole ordeal that you have?
it takes me longer to do my hair than shave.
i heard there is like a strategy behind it. it keeps the sweat out of your face or something.
do you have sort of like a...
you should get sponsored buy this product. what's the brand?
how do they know? they don't know yet.
you used to wear some backwards hats.
you don't do that anymore?
no? why not?
how does it feel to speak to us after a shower up here in the interview room for the first time this week?
your serve has been really on all week. you've kept your self down on the break points to a minimum. what are you doing differently here in cincinnati?
it was your third straight victory over stan. is there anything that kind of matches up well with him?
talk about i think it was the second break to win the  in the second set. the long point. did you think you could get to that ball and then return it?
yeah.
from your point of view, what was the biggest difference from the first set to the next two? seemed like two different matches almost.
i believe this is your first semifinal at a masters level. what does that mean to you, especially at 32? you're a little bit older than some of the other guys.
you had lost six straight to novak. what was the difference today from the previous matches for you?
you said novak didn't play his best. he had a couple of tough matches that were not at his best in canada, and then first round, first match here. did you get a sense that maybe you would have an opportunity to play him when he wasn't at 100% with his game?
you got a 30 lead and 63 lead in the tiebreaker. he climbed back. could you take us through how that went for you in that tiebreaker?
what did you think when you won the challenge on the serve for set point in the first set? that was like the slimmest of margins that that ball was in.
second time beating world no.1. personally for you where does this rank? where does this rank for you and kind of how special is it? this is the second time you've beaten a world no.1.
are you feeling any different the second time than the first time after all that time that has passed? can you remember the feeling the first time?
goosebumps.
you're one of the few guys outside of the big 4 who has won a masters event before. why do you think it's been so hard for some of the other guys to get through in the last few years? do you think that's going to change?
not too many top 20 players play doubles so much. you have played a lot of doubles in your career. i was wondering what that has helped you with with respect to your game in singles playing so much doubles?
one break in the match. that came right after you lost a tough tiebreaker in the first. you had three break points at that point. he came back, but you got the job done. can you take us through the importance of that first game in the second set to get the break?
2:23.
you played some really good defense there saving match point. unbelievable plays. can you just take us through that game when you were serving and got yourself out of trouble to take it to the breaker in the third?
right after the match social media was really buzzing with how much they enjoyed this. for you being in it, was it one of the bigger matches of the year as far as just how grueling it was?
looking ahead to your next match to play roger or gal. i'm curious, what's the most kind of jaw dropping shot you've ever saw gal hit?
is it hard to keep his scrambling abilities and his defense abilities out of your head when you're playing through the rallies of having to do too much, going for too much on the lines?
i know you just got off the court not too long ago, but i was wondering if you had any correspondence yet with amlie, and will you have any with her prior to your next match?
is there any aspect of your game right now that you're focusing on heading into the us open? if there is one, how did it play out for you today?
what was it like to be in the middle of the match and hear serena williams say that you act like a baby on the court or whatever she said?
that's why she likes you.
you have played john a few other times, obviously. what is it like playing somebody who hits so many aces, not really getting a rhythm in the match? how do you cope with that?
you were warming up this morning, returning serves for jerzy janowicz. was that preparation for john isner's big serve?
the atmosphere, i mean, not to say that's a small court by any means, but it's a little more intimate. was it enjoyable for you?
just returning to if you play roger, is that going to be a match you look at and say, i need this win for my confidence because it's roger; shows me where i'm at right now; or is it one of those, i just need a win?
can you sort of explain what happened out there.
do you understand why? what went wrong?
is it just the surface that's the problem, or...
what's the process now to get ready for us open for you?
are there certain areas of your game you want to focus on specifically?
even though you lost, you still saved a couple of match points, a few match points. i just wanted to know, in the first match point you played, or the second one, you hit a fault, you challenged, it was the wrong way, and then you won the point. you're well known for saving these match points. what goes through your mind at that moment?
could you talk about what tommy did exceptionally well today?
do you feel you have enough match play behind you going into the open? would you have wished for a little more?
so is the idea just to go to newyork and practice and work on some things and stuff?
right now is it just an issue of timing? is it something physical? what is kind of keeping you from your best level right now?
between wimbledon and canada obviously you got married, but how much practice time did you have? did you have enough?
just want to know if there's anything else that you're going to put into your training for the us open?
the ankle, you seemed to be favoring it in the first set when you were sent the wrong way.
do you continue to be pleased with your level?
is it a big adjustment when you play the first match here, then?
compared to the weather in canada, we haven't had that heat and humidity like usual.
does that make a difference? make it easier?
is it important to you at all to get into the top 8 seeds?
is it a slightly different experience, you know, from what you have experienced the last few years anyway to be that far away from the top 4? does it affect the way you approach your tennis?
can you talk about amlie? you had a test period and now you're sticking with it. what did you see in her that seemed like she was the right person to bring you whatever you're looking for?
speaking of miami this may seem like a silly question, but we have all seen the commercial; they show it a lot down there anyway. have you physically run from your apartment from key biscayne to the courts?
impressive.
maybe you'll join wozniacki in new york marathon.
before you had the back surgery, was there ever an option you could somehow do physical therapy? was that a difficult decision to actually go ahead with the surgery, or was it just obvious it had to be done?
was it essentially a wearandtear kind of injury they thought, or was there something that...
it's a soldout crowd here today and a lot of people are talking about what a great lineup it is. do these masters 1000s feel different than the slams? it's a smaller event, but the fans still get to see sort of a blockbuster lineup all day.
you'd buy one of those tickets?
how tough was it today with that sun and the clouds in and out?
what about your feeling coming back to cincy after your success here last year?
is this a better ticket for fans in a sense that you have a grand slam where you have all the main players and a field like today where you get both sides of the draw and really access at a smaller event. people will see as much tennis as they want.
a couple matches under your belt. did you talk about murray yet?
what's the best practical advice you've ever gotten as a tennis player?
who gave you that advice?
how special are the 300 masters wins, i mean, among all the records that you probably have to keep track of?
you said before the match you were nervous about the first round, how it can always be tough. is that about how you expected, how it went?
obviously pretty tight there in the first set tiebreaker. can you take us through that as well as the back end of the second set?
you come from a small country. i think most of your main idols growing up were not swiss. do you think it's important for a country to have players coming up and people coming up to have someone from their own country as a player to look up to, or it's not really that important?
you played at a tricky time of the day with the shadow. it was right at the t at some point. i was wondering how difficult that could be to return in the shade? and vice versa, do you do anything different if you're in one or the other and the guy is going to receive in either the sun or shade?
when you notice those are the conditions, do you change your tactics in terms of serving to make it more difficult for the opponent?
just some thoughts on playing against vasek. you have played him a few times now. how do you feel about his game and how he's developing his future?
speaking of tossing and glare and all that, when your opponent catches a lot of tosses, does that bother you or...
do you feel bad for your opponent or...
you looked very surprised to me at the end that you won. were you? was it different than other wins in that respect?
what were you thinking and what were you feeling when you weren't able to close it out in the fourth set?
how has the flavor of the grass changed in the three years since you last dined on centre court?
i read a tweet by ivo karlovic who said you should have won all the sets you played today. do you agree with him?
are you going to take some time off now or straight to practice?
last wimbledon you looked very tired; french open you looked very tired. today you looked like a person who could stand there till you got the trophy. you looked extremely fit. obviously you may be on a special diet, special physical training regime. share some secrets with us.
given everything you said about the mental side of it and how the match went today, is this the grand slam title you're most proud of?
at the end of the match on court you said to roger, thank you for letting me win. sounded like it was a joke; also sounded a little bit apologetic. was it partially because the crowd was so in his favor, or was it respect for your opponent?
how did you feel about the crowd?
were you surprised how much roger was approaching the net? i think he served and volleyed 36 times.
fifth set the crowd is going crazy; you're playing roger federer; you've had some problems at crunch time. what was going through your mind? what was your inner dialogue?
twice at least i saw that you went like this to the crowd. why did you do that?
were you disappointed they didn't support you more?
what do you think of facing roger federer here in a final, knowing that in all of your matches all through these years you've only faced him once on grass here two years ago?
what's the key?
you seemed to be slipping a fair bit today, as did grigor. are the courts more slippery at the back of the court? wrong shoes, or what?
were your occasional looks to your box triggered by frustration of the slipping or by the fact that he was hitting some incredible shots, just driving you crazy?
can you remember exactly how many times you did have to change your shoes today?
your matches throughout this wimbledon, they sort of had a pattern. you start well and then hit a tricky period. it happened again today. is there a reason for that?
the more that you get into the last couple rounds of a slam year after year after year throughout your career as you get older, does that get more stressful or is it a little bit different type of stress when you were younger and doing it the first couple times?
a year and a half ago or so you had the big win in melbourne. you've had this run deep into slam after slam. many players might say that that's great, but talk about your feelings about being close so many times but not quite getting there? is it frustrating?
you said you might have won a couple of them. which ones?
on a similar subject, do you just not think about those finals, or do you try and learn from them going on?
my question is fairly similar. you said something interesting. you said it would mean a lot to you mentally to win the title here. is that because post 2011 when you were the man to beat and three out of four slams you won, you dipped by your very own high standards? is that what you mean when you say mentally?
is it weighing on your mind that it's ten slams and two titles, both at the australian?
your rivalry with roger seems to have a bit more of an edge to it than with andy or rafa on court. do you sense that when you're out there? why do you think that is?
boris must be a pleased and a relieved man. pleased that you won, and relieved because had your match gone on much longer he might have missed germany in the world cup.
so he made it clear he wanted to get straight off to watch the football?
against cilic you started really well, and then you fell behind two sets to one. you rallied. in today's match, you started off well. up a break in the second and up a break in the fourth. fighting yourself a little bit. talk about what's going on emotionally in these matches.
when you played roger here two years ago, you said afterwards you weren't at your best for reasons you didn't want to go into at the time. do you remember what they were? can you share them with us now?
how much have you seen roger play this tournament? are you sensing that his level has been good?
you and novak are both so athletic and so agile. can you explain what made the court such a challenge today to keep your footing? what was so difficult about it?
you had some good chances in that match, didn't you? in the tiebreak, three set points. are you frustrated?
is that your overriding emotion, frustration?
what have you learned about yourself and perhaps what glimpse do you have into your future by getting this far and by being in this match?
how often do you get back to bulgaria? do you think you're going to be perceived differently there now?
at the level you were playing, which is pretty high, do you think there are more than a handful of players out there who could have maintained like he did and ended up beating you?
at the moment it looks like it's going to be, again, two guys from the big four competing for the championship. we've discussed all the fortnight about that notion of being around the corner from breaking into that group. what are your thoughts as you exit wimbledon about what it will take to break into what the big four has?
you didn't play that good in the first set, as you said. is that because of nerves? when did you find your rhythm and get confidence back?
those set points that you had in the fourth set, are you at a point now where you're able to not have them haunt you for a while and just get past it?
what are your plans now? are you going to take some time off?
how do you think you'll remember wimbledon 2014 when we get more distant from just the end of this match?
what was your feeling? you played six matches on centre court or no.1 court? are you now used to playing on the big courts now?
you did get quite a lot of impressive support from the crowd. how did that affect you during the game?
who do you think will win on sunday?
if it ends up with federer and djokovic?
how many times did you change shoes during the match?
roger suggested that you might have had a fitness problem after the first two sets. is that correct?
you don't think that problem affected your performance at all?
how is it to play a countryman and a friend in the quarterfinals at wimbledon?
what is special?
overall it was a very good tournament for you, don't you think?
considering you were the australian open champion and then you had a few tournaments that didn't go your way. then montecarlo. seems you're playing very good tennis.
will roger win it again this year?
is he playing well enough?
did you sense that the crowd were very much with roger, who is a favorite here? does that bother you at all?
i think it's fair to say you know roger really well. throughout these years, what do you think has changed in his game? what does he present right now versus what he used to a few years back? can you specify?
there's been a record number of tiebreaks in this tournament in the men's draw. why do you think that is? grass is supposed to be slower, more even.
how much has it meant to you to be swiss no.1, and how would you feel not being swiss no.1?
how does it feel, big boy?
earlier in the tournament we discussed the big four, what you learned from the various guys. what is your sense of change that is taking place right now with you guys approaching what they're doing?
is there a notable change in the locker room with regards to the attitude? is there more belief amongst the players outside the top four?
today genie was asked if she felt surprised and whether or not people should be surprised by the fact she was playing in her third semifinal this year. she said, no, absolutely not, because i've always believed i'd be playing here; i've worked for it. would you answer that question similarly? would you say you're not surprised by your ascension here because it's always been the goal?
back to the theme of the upandcoming guys encroaching on the big four, how much effect does it have when you get results like nick's yesterday and grigor today?
you said it would be time to step up. i guess there would be no better time to do that against roger in the semifinal. he's going for the eighth title. that's not going to be in your thoughts at all when you play?
when you first came out on the circuit there was a fair amount of talk about your being the next great one or real potential. you've had some good wins, but there's been a lot of bumps in the road, injuries. talk about what finally breaking through here means.
and the greatest lesson that you've learned and the toughest moment of doubt that you had?
roger will be basically in his home on centre court at wimbledon. how easy is it going to be in your mind to play the 32yearold man rather than the seventime wimbledon champion?
you've got an interesting coaching combination, two men from different generations, an italian, then ivan. can you specify what does one bring to the people and the other, how they work together, their benefits?
are you still aware this could be a defining moment in your career?
when you were exactly nick kyrgios' age you were ranked 380 and playing futures i think in sherbrooke. do you have a sense of what type of tournament this was for him and how you might have reacted at 19? have the last four years gone quickly or slowly in your mind?
you're a young guy, but this is a day a lot of people would never see, not only somebody making the semifinal but two of your making the semifinals. it's tough to put in historical context, but how do you feel about that?
how would you describe roger's serve and your serve, then the other similarities and differences in your respective games?
how do you do that?
genie was talking about trying to enjoy the occasion even though she's got to focus on the semifinal. do you have an image of how you'll be able to enjoy walking out onto centre court at wimbledon in a semifinal without losing focus?
when in this process of these years did you have the greatest doubt? did you ever think you might not ever make it to the final weekend of a slam?
in his post match grigor said he could tell something was wrong even in the warmup. did you feel that as well?
in your reckoning so far  i mean, you haven't had time to analyze  would you say you lost today and he won or he won outright?
so in that case you lost the game today and why?
what tactics, if any, did you discuss with amlie mauresmo in advance of the match?
can you describe the difference between the pressure this year and last year, defending champ, and how that might come into play whatsoever in a match like this?
only four players have successfully defended their title in the open era after winning it for the first time. now that you've actually gone through that whole experience yourself, can you identify with why that's such a small number?
is this the toughest loss of your career, would you say?
we saw kim looking understandably upset running into the clubhouse. what did she say to you? have you seen her yet?
how would you describe dimitrov's game and what your appraisal is of his potential?
when you talked about the younger players coming through, when you see what happened to nadal last night, do you think that gap is the smallest it's ever been?
do you believe your best tennis is yet to come?
with what you said about dimitrov being young, did the performance  with no disrespect  make you feel a bit old out there today, that he's coming through like that?
how will it work now with amlie? would you like to carry on working with her?
what feelings did you have on court when things were going so badly for you? is it so tough to react, to find a way? what were you thinking really?
on this court you've had an incredible run. do you think in a certain way at certain point it's just the nature of sport that there will be an off tournament? can you reflect on this incredible run you've had on this court.
many were struck with the dignity you showed in the aftermath of this defeat bowing to the duke and duchess of cambridge. what was going through your mind at that point, and did you mention to dimitrov, do you want to bow to the royal box?
did you feel this morning at all that it might be a flat day, or was it out of the blue to you?
rafa said yesterday he was looking forward to going to the beach. what are you going to look forward to be doing in the next few days?
can it be any comfort to you that nothing will ever change what you did last year?
you spoke a minute ago about a day at the office. are you enjoying playing tennis at the moment?
you seem particularly philosophical after that. are you still 100% confident in your own game, and would be looking to go on and try to win the title here in the future?
did you come into wimbledon with these concerns with areas you would like to improve, or has this loss focused your mind on that area?
your mother missed the first section of the match. did you notice? was that a factor? is that the first time she would have missed any portion of a match that you've lost at wimbledon?
now that you're out, will you watch the tournament?
over your career have you gained most motivation from victories or defeats?
i was wondering how you found the crowd on centre court? do you have a message for people who gathered on murray mound, as well?
can you explain what it was like carrying the weight of public expectation throughout this fortnight as defending champion.
you had a very good first week. did you ever believe that you would go all the way to the final? did you have that belief in you when you started?
you played so well on monday; today you say you didn't play well. how can it change so quickly?
after the disappointments of last year, what does this year mean to you reaching yet another semifinal at wimbledon?
you're playing either raonic or kyrgios. yesterday kyrgios said you were his big idol, it would be a dream come true to meet you. do you have a similar story when you met your big idol?
being a twin mother myself, i know how hard it is when they're babies. and you have doubles sets. how do you cope and how do you prepare yourself for this tournament, and how much does it motivate you being a dad?
is it more difficult playing against a friend and a compatriot, or are you able to shut that out when you're on court?
i think novak was saying on tv the other day he asked you about being a father, becoming a father. is that the case? what did you tell him?
what did he ask you?
what do you make of the period we're in right now where there are these young guys on the rise and the four of you who have dominated the majors for nine years still in a position for competing for those?
the all england club has been a lot stricter about the allwhite rule this year. i know you had issues with the orange shoes last year. have you noticed a change? your thoughts on that?
yes.
once you get to the semifinals do you relax a bit because it's been such a big tournament, or do you step up the pressure because the matches get bigger?
you talk about the younger guys out there. are you looking more at your draw and how this is affecting you and your opportunity to get back to where you want to get this week?
can you elaborate about raonic, your familiarity with his game, the contrast of styles with yours?
you move very well and you serve very well. in the end it was hard. stan was really fighting for the last points. how is your confidence? in montecarlo he came back and won the match. did that go through your mind because he was fighting so hard?
what turned it around for you? how did you get back in the winning way?
what effect does it have on you when you realize that rafa lost and perhaps, if you heard, that murray lost while you were on court?
there was a moment in the fourth set in the changeover where you sit down and your eyes were closed. were you visualizing or meditating, trying to calm yourself down?
you appeared to be distracted at times by the noise coming from outside. how significant was that?
tomorrow you have a day off. what have you planned, except from practicing and relaxing?
what is that?
how important is experience in games like that? you've been in situations like that lots of times, two sets to one down. how important is the fact that you've been there before?
you're going to be a father for the first time this year. how is the pregnancy going and how does this motivate you?
how difficult is it to not look at the entire draw when guys are falling by the wayside, the bigger names? how close are you paying attention to that and how it's going to affect you?
you changed your shoes. can you explain a little bit more about that. what was the problem and how did it help you?
the grass is supposed to be slower and bounces truer. we've had a record number of tiebreaks in the tournament, suggesting that breaking is not going on as much. what is your explanation for that?
so the serve should be slower, too?
how would you assess the match against dimitrov next given the run he's had on grass? do you have any sympathy for andy murray being defending champion and how hard it is to, i suppose, keep winning at tournaments you've won before?
you just spoke about the thrill of becoming a family man. your family sacrificed everything. can you imagine where novak djokovic would be if those sacrifices hadn't occurred?
what are your thoughts on the way dimitrov has attained the level that he has, and also the idea of the young guys maybe getting this opportunity to break into the big four's stranglehold?
and the young guys led by dimitrov and the opportunity maybe to break the run the big four that's been nine plus years.
are you going to be wearing your lucky shoes against grigor?
tell me if really in your mind you thought it was possible to happen this so easily, three sets to love of the champion of last wimbledon?
so are you surprised or not?
in your tv interview after the match you mentioned you noticed andy didn't look quite right in the warmup. what did you notice?
must have surprised you, because he hadn't dropped a set before today.
did you specifically notice anything about his game that wasn't working? if so, what was it? forehand? backhand?
you sit here super calm; it's just another match. but you're in a wimbledon semifinal; you've just beaten the defending champion. you must be incredibly excited.
early in the tournament when you were asked about the big four, you said you thought it was just around the corner when the young guys would be breaking through and winning majors. with what's happened yesterday with rafa and today with andy, what are your thoughts on that timetable and about the young guys breaking through?
you used the term 'focus.' how is that different today than any other match considering the importance and how you did it against the defending champ? was it extra special today?
during the match andy was overheard complaining about something that should have apparently happened five minutes before. are you aware of anything that happened five minutes before?
were you brought on quickly perhaps after the women's game?
talking about young guys or girls going far in the competition, maria sharapova won 10 years ago when she was 17. what kind of tips are you getting from her?
are you talking about this?
what did you say to andy at the net at the end of the match?
you seemed to look up to the sky at the end of the match and blow a kiss of some sort. was that my imagination or was it significant?
when i came here, djokovic was up one break in the fifth. you may have to play him. if at the beginning of this tournament they would have told you for you it's better to play a player like murray or djokovic, what is the difference?
in general, on grass, what is the player that you would of feared more?
no feared. okay, don't say 'feared.' i know you don't fear anyone.
can you elaborate on the challenge in facing novak? what are the specifics about his game that are of greatest concern and what do you need to do to win a match against novak?
what about the style of play? how would you contrast his versus yours?
was maria on court watching you today? assuming you go to the final, will she be hanging around to support you all the way?
did you see kyrgios at all yesterday?
talk about the transition that one has to go through when you're young and you're arriving and you can play a bit more free.
but the transition you have to make to where you are now...
tough one today from the position you were in. do you feel it was a missed opportunity?
were you nervous at the start? you didn't get going in the first set, did you? why was that?
given all of the noise going on outside with the andy murray match, did you find that distracting at all? seemed like novak was struggling with it a bit.
he changed his shoes at the start of the fourth set and it seemed to make quite a big difference.
so it was a tough road, but you feel like you're moving forward compared to last year?
if you look at the rest of the players that are still in, do you think novak is favorite now?
could you clear up for us what happened at the end of the match?
what was the exchange on court before the match finished where the chair umpire got involved?
did you shake hands at the end? are you okay now with each other?
obviously going into the match feliciano had played seven tiebreaks. when you go into a match knowing he's serving well, how do you manage to handle that?
now you have roger to face. what are your thoughts on how he's playing at the moment? have you watched any of his matches?
the experience of that match in montecarlo, the circumstances of you winning it, a final as well, how much confidence will you take from that into the match tomorrow?
what are the rituals and superstitions that you have before and during a match?
can you give us an assessment of what you've been doing differently this year regarding previous years at wimbledon?
a question about the shirt that you're wearing. have you ever heard of stan the man musial? and what does that tshirt mean to you? are you the man? are you ready to beat roger?
do you feel you're the man?
it's going to be your third day in a row to play tomorrow. how are you feeling physically?
when roger had a difficult year last year, some people were suggesting it might be difficult for him to overcome that or might be the end of an era. given what you said earlier, you would have thought that would be premature?
in terms of the challenge you face, what happened last year doesn't make your job tomorrow any easier.
will you join roger to watch the switzerland match?
have you seen the previous matches together?
if switzerland is able to win against argentina, given that you won today and roger won today, what would this day mean for switzerland?
once he started serving so well, was there anything you could do?
in the second set tiebreak i think you had a chance with a forehand that you missed. little things like that give you hope and then it's difficult or...
when you went in to do the match, can you tell us about what your game plan was, what you saw as the keys to defeating him.
on the return, did you try different things? did you have to guess? the kicker serve was fantastic, too.
were you experiencing a problem with your foot? were you getting some treatment on your foot?
what are your thoughts on how nick was able to beat you today?
he's no.144 in the world and only 19 years old. what do you think of his future as a pro tennis player?
do you get the sense from that match that he's a player you'll be meeting time and time again in the future in perhaps the later stages of competitions?
before you came to wimbledon you weren't sure what your expectations of yourself were on grass. you fought through the first three rounds and fell in the fourth. how do you feel about what you did here in wimbledon? did you exceed your expectations at all?
i know the disappointment is great, but how different a defeat is that to the previous two years, and how much better do you feel about yourself today than you did last year or after rosol?
why do you think grass has been hard for you in these last few years? you five times in a row made the final here, and since then it's been a weaker surface for you resultswise.
i am just saying, is there anything in particular about grass or is it the timing?
earlier you said that tennis is very mental. it's easy to play with nothing to lose. could you talk about what it's like for you to have your great run at the french open and then to come here, be no.1, past champion, what pressures do you feel?
given his age and experience, were you expecting him to crack at some stage? how surprised were you that he didn't?
next year.
did you feel the best of you was still to come on grass here?
no, in this tournament did you feel that you were getting better?
when you play a young player, kei nishikori, i think you said he had top 10 potential. i'm not hearing that much today with kyrgios. i'm wondering if that's because you don't feel the same way or you haven't seen enough of him play?
you were cocky, cheeky today. how are you feeling today?
you got the greek connection. is your father greek?
is he from greece?
how would you describe what you were able to do? how were you able to win?
what were your emotions when you wrapped this up?
john mcenroe said he thinks you can win the whole tournament. how do you feel about that?
given that nadal started slowly in his previous matches, was one of your ploys to come out and just hit him with everything first up?
john mcenroe may think you can win this whole tournament, but from your flash tv interview afterwards, am i right thinking your mum didn't think you could win it?
have you spoken to your mum yet since you won?
what will you say when you do?
are you ever a little afraid when you play to hit a second serve 130 miles per hour? stepanek last year told me you did something unbelievable in a tiebreak.
then nine match points with gasquet. today again. you just don't think or what happens?
the other day you said that between you and rafa, you have won an incredible 14 grand slams. people were thinking by the end of wimbledon it would be 15. what do you think of that?
you can probably tell that the buzz is building at home from looking at twitter and online. do you feel any pressure with the weight of a nation, australia, behind you now?
how hard do you think the recovery will be with a match again tomorrow?
rafael nadal said earlier that you play very good on the grass and he hasn't seen you on any other surfaces. he's not sure how good you are on other surfaces. what's your answer to that?
you played raonic at roland garros last month. what can you use from that?
you won the juniors doubles 2012/2013, and you were the australian open junior champion. does this help you to play on a big stage like today?
do you think your mum will believe now you can win tomorrow?
and the tournament?
talk about your funky strapping that you have on your arm, what's the story there? what kind of design is it?
no story?
three years ago it was bernard tomic being the big thing. what have you learned from his experience and that experience?
in australia everybody was talking about you and kokkinakis during the australian open. now you are here and we don't know where kokkinakis is. do you think this is strange?
you spoke about being grounded. who are the people around you keeping you grounded right at the moment?
what struck most people was how fearlessly you played on that stage. how did you acquire such a fearless attitude? have you always had such an attitude?
we're learning bits and pieces about you, including a mother that can be critical. what is the most interesting thing about you outside of tennis that you can share with us?
when you're playing trick shots on centre court, it seems like it can't get any better than that. what is your tennis dream? what motivates you coming through the ranks?
is there a particular trophy you've dreamed of winning?
you said you brought your xbox with you. have you traveled here with your family? girlfriend?
you have a chain around your neck. is it a lucky chain?
and your relationship with simon, do you rethink that after this result or where is it at?
do you have a name for the trick shot and do you have a name for the dance you performed at the end?
what is most important to you about the australian tennis tradition and your opportunity to make more history for australia?
there's been a lot of great australian champions over the years. it's your first experience of centre court today. any thoughts of you following in the old guy's footsteps?
how happy are you today that you chose tennis in front of basketball?
can you say a bit more?
again and again rafa just said that you were fearless, you had nothing to lose. talk about that. did you feel that way? did you feel a sense of joy or freedom?
how would you compare what you're feeling now to when three weeks ago you lost in the first round of a challenger to john patrick smith?
what were you thinking at that moment looking ahead?
why apparently are you splitting up with your coach? what is the reason for it? you're doing so well. we are surprised.
i know you tweeted earlier this week about wanting to get to 25,000 followers. i think you cracked that when you went up a break in the fourth. did you realize it would be that easy to reach that milestone?
do you find it easy to keep playing with this freedom?
you are still here in part because of hawkeye saving that match point. if you win the wimbledon championships, will you send a percentage of your winnings to the hawkeye company?
that win will take you to 65 in the rankings. how will it feel that you won't be playing in front of one man and a dog?
i know you tennis players only want to think about the next match, but it could be roger federer in the semifinals now. he's your big idol, isn't he? how would that be?
you've had straightset wins up till now. do you feel you've been challenged enough heading into the quarters?
what can you say about your service game today?
is there a dynamic change now that stan has that slam and has moved up a level, the dynamic between the two of you?
he now knows how to win a slam.
how would you describe your journey as a player since the last time you won a major?
what has it been like for you to pursue another one?
how close are you now to the form in 2012 when you last won here? as a supplementary, the bookmakers have you at fourth favorite. do you think perhaps we're slightly underestimating you given you have won here seven times?
the average age of men's players in the singles draw have been rising. today there were two of you 30somethings. do you think that might change soon? we have young players breaking through. also, do you think it's good or bad for the game that that's been happening?
was that the first breakpoint you faced in that last game?
yes.
you went to the net today quite often like a man determined to protect the art of serve and volley. would it be better if the balls and courts were speeded up to preserve serve and volley as an art?
you are going to play a pretty good server and a pretty big hitter in stan. against a player like that, do you prefer to start aggressive yourself and not let him set up his big game, or would you rather get in the rallies with him and see how the match progresses?
you may not think about it in these terms, but you put behind you two of the tougher moments from last year. you're past the second round here. you beat robredo who got you in new york. how does that make you to feel? and also, could you mention davis cup for a second?
roger, you play good tennis. everything perfect. the most important thing today is argentina/switzerland.
how are you going to prepare for that match? a beer, some cookies?
novak talked last night about wimbledon should rethink the middle sunday. do you have any thoughts on that?
happy to get the match finished before the rain and another interruption?
how was it for the match to be postponed from the saturday? what did you do in the meantime?
your coach said that it's not human to have to play to win this tournament five bestoffiveset matches in seven days. how would you describe the road to the championship here given the delays?
in what way what you accomplished at the australian open help for you this major?
were you disappointed it was postponed on saturday? do you think that decision may have given other players an unfair advantage this week?
how will that affect if you play one of the other players in the semifinals later in the week that haven't gone through this? could have detrimental effect.
roger was the last on centre court on saturday, finished around 7:30. were you surprised they didn't put you on centre court to get the game completed?
is it fair to say grass is not your favorite surface? are you happier on it now at the moment?
did you have some discussion with the referees about the scheduling decision or they just told you and that was it?
what is your opinion about when it's getting dark and hawkeye is not functioning? do you feel that's a time when they should stop the matches?
do you remember the time when you were told that the match was postponed?
what was the time?
you were told about the postponement long before the restart of the matches or just a few minutes before?
if you have to play three matches in three days, is there any advantages that grass is the surface rather than hard court or clay?
if it's isner that you play, how would you describe him as a player? what are the biggest challenges about playing isner for you?
you mentioned the rescheduling you thought was because it was good for them rather than good for you as players. what do you mean by that?
do you feel in general as the no.3 player in the world, aussie open champion, you're being treated unfairly at all in comparison with the other big four who get a chance at the big courts all the time?
you took a bit of a tumble at one stage. everything okay physically?
roger said he wouldn't mind seeing a clock for the time between points to make sure some players don't take too long. what are your views of this?
and is the clock the best way to do that?
you mentioned in your tv interview, you said you played well outdoors, and when it went indoors you kind of fell back a bit. could you expand on that, what the difference is with the roof?
with the roof, were you given an explanation why the match started with the roof open when there was rain coming?
how good does it feel to have come through a relatively tight spot and come through well?
how happy are you with your performance?
you didn't like how alex celebrated your victory last year. if he does come to watch you in the final rounds, would you like him to leave his saltire at home?
when you went off court, i presume you spoke with amlie, what were the logistics of that? did you have a chat in the corridor?
sir alex was in the royal box today. have you had a chance to see him? how much contact do you have with him generally?
you mentioned getting your game out of the way, but everything has gone quite smoothly for you in terms of the scheduling. in the long run, can it be beneficial for you the fact that other guys have got a bit of a backlog? we even heard today stan wawrinka have a bit of a moan the way the scheduling has worked for him.
what would you most want the upandcoming players to learn from the way you and the other three guys in the big four have achieved and how you've gone about it?
in terms of how you've gone about it, what they might have learned, is there anything you can point to that's a common denominator among the four of you that you would like to see them learn from you?
you mentioned you talked to alex ferguson. last year you mentioned gold dust from him. without giving away any secrets, did he tell you anything today you might use further on in the tournament?
you play dimitrov next, who is not a top10 guy but has gotten a lot of attention. when you see someone getting this sort of buildup before they have a major breakthrough, what do you think? can it be harmful to them or does it just encourage them?
your reading of what kevin anderson was going to do today really stood out. was that luck or was there a bit more, a sixth sense in reading what he's going to do?
four matches, you haven't dropped a set. you probably would have bought that at the start. how is your energy physically and mentally? can you compare it with last year at the same stage? how does it feel to you at the moment? have you got loads in the tank?
does it feel better than last year?
you did very well in the bbc copauppy challenge. are you the best player on the circuit?
you said in your messages with alex ferguson you've been talking about the world cup.
may i ask if the subject of england popped up in the world cup?
back to dimitrov, what changes have you seen in him since he took up with roger rasheed?
how big a step up do you think grigor is from what you've faced so far?
sir alex has a load of managerial experience. did you talk to him or message him at all when you were looking for a new coach?
what are your thoughts on the idea of a timer for the time in between points? do you think that could possibly be something that would be embraced by the players and be helpful?
would you ever consider getting fergy as part of your coaching team now that he's out of work?
not as a consultant or anything like that?
took a bit of a battering with the serves there. 86 in total aces.
are you feeling tired? you played so many matches in the last three weeks.
confidence must be very, very high.
is it the height the serve is coming at that makes it so difficult?
even though this is a bangbang kind of match, is it fun to play that kind of match?
were you surprised that he went for a second serve on this last break point? he went for a first serve and hit like 130.
is it a relief that the final set was 75 given the schedule that's ahead of you potentially over the next few days? are you happy that it finished quickly? it could have gone or for a while, couldn't it?
what about facing stan?
you must be delighted with that victory. it looked pretty emphatic.
yourself and andy both benefited from playing under the roof today. there is a bit of a backlog. stan wawrinka was complaining about the scheduling. he will have to play back to back. is it beneficial to you going forward in this tournament?
didn't play a warmup tournament here, and then you had three very tight matches and only dropped one set. are you where you want to be at this stage of the tournament?
what about the left upper arm? you pinched that a couple times in the third set.
did you receive treatment after the match on that arm?
but is it hampering when you play?
not at all?
you face marin in the next round, which pits your coach, boris becker, up against goran ivanisevic. do you expect boris to be working especially hard the next couple days to make sure...
is this the point in the tournament where boris' impact comes into its own?
you're obviously very good friends with marin. whenever we ask about you two friends playing each other you say, yeah, but we're professionals on the court. is there some intensity that perhaps gets lost on both sides because you have so much respect and liking for each other off court?
is there any particular strength which you see in cilic which you think you would like to prepare the most for?
goran was such a force of nature as a player, such a strong character. do you think that will naturally have an impact on marin and how he approaches it on the court?
marin said that everybody remembers where they were when goran won wimbledon here. do you remember that?
when goran won.
andy murray next in a wimbledon quarterfinal. how does that sound?
obviously you're coming in here fresh from your victory at queen's. how have you felt on the grass so far in this campaign and what sort of levels of confidence do you take into the match?
you said your job is not done yet. what targets did you set yourself when you arrived to start wimbledon?
you played all four of your matches on either centre court or court1.
do you feel like some of these things that you've gotten, you've been treated like a bigger star or champion than you are, helps you on the court too with confidence?
you've beaten murray once. was it in mexico you beat him? what can you remember about that match?
from a tactical standpoint, what are the keys on grass for you to challenge andy murray here?
andy said that maybe it was a big burden for you to have, an unfair burden, to be compared to federer at such an early age. can you put in perspective what that has done to the way you've handled things psychologically as you've developed?
i saw you practicing with andy in madrid. seemed like there were a lot of jokes going back and forth between you and him and your coach. seems like you guys actually like each other. can you give us some insight into your relationship, what you think about him as a person?
you have no problems with his scottish accent?
how tough will it be, the fact of him being defending champion? also, what about the influence of amlie might have on his approach?
andy hasn't dropped a set yet in this tournament. if you can be the first person to take a set off him, do you think that will put him under the kind of pressure he hasn't experienced for a while?
today you have achieved what no other bulgarian male tennis player has achieved so far. how does this make you feel?
how big a disadvantage is it for you on a day like today to be put on a court without a roof?
in terms of fitness, do you think you can go five sets with andy?
can you talk a moment about your own coach, roger rasheed, what he's brought to your game. i know he has an aussie rules background. is there anything from that sport that...
is that why you've been so successful this year?
you've been hotly tipped for a while now. how close are you to consistently challenging the big four for grand slams and titles?
obviously you had a pretty good match on your serve; 33 aces in three sets. it is the most satisfying thing of the match for you?
last year you had to pull out; you're the first one through now to the quarterfinals. quite a turnaround. how do you feel compared to last year mentally and physically?
how happy are you after coming back? you beat berdych the other day and backed it up against an unseeded player. is that pleasing that you were able to turn up and play well again?
were you concerned at all about an emotional letdown after the berdych match?
chardy said that the most difficult thing with your serve is to read it because you vary it a lot. would you say that is the biggest improvement with goran?
you served your suspension shortly after wimbledon last year. have you learned your lesson from how that came about, and what was that time like for you?
you change with you did around supplements and glucose and stuff like that?
goran was such a big character. he played here and when he won here, and when he did, he was talking about the different sides of his personality that he would bring out at different times. does any of that rub off on you, his sort of largerthanlife approach?
you want him to as gregarious and be his natural self, this sort of imposing personality. so that helps you, does it?
he's a very strong character. he always says what what's on his mind.
and he's very honest and quite, you know.
you certainly did yourself justice in the second half of the match. did that break help you gather your thoughts?
when you went off for the weather interruption and closing of the roof.
how do you see him progressing now?
probably dimitrov.
capable of going all the way again, do you feel?
do you think you kind of started the game a bit late? what happened in the first set when we expected a little bit more resistance?
how intimidating was the crowd?
you cheered him on last year; you going to cheer him on him again?
how would describe your first centre court experience?
will we see you coming back to south africa for the davis cup any time soon?
and how would you track your progress from now and 2011? you reached the fourth round of every major this year. would you say you have benefited from the schedule, sort of the freer schedule?
did you get to him today? double fault at a couple key times and seemed like you kept the pressure up.
can you tell us a little bit about the difficulty with a rain delay and how you manage that.
did you mean any play today or for three or four hours or something?
him coming in that much, you just feel like you're going to power the ball and get it past him or he's going to miss a volley, it's just the law of average averages?
there are three seeded players in the tournament that haven't a lot a set. murray, federer, and you. what do you make of this?
how would you say your comfort level is on grass now compared to when you first played here? do you think you still have some way to go before you're as comfortable as you might become on this surface?
has something clicked on grass, or is it just familiarity with the surface?
have you keeping on eye on nishikori's match?
any thoughts on either of them?
what rituals or superstitions do you have before and during a match?
people point to nadal for having a whole litany of things he does between points. what do you do, if anything?
why an even number of times?
first time in the second week at this tournament. do you sort of feel like you're experienced in these situations now or it's going to be something quite new?
any danger of not getting through today? i don't know if everybody is going to finish tonight.
how come genie is in room one and you're in room two?
is there anything about the first sets in general that are particularly difficult for you?
you told us many times that you much prefer playing tennis with the sun on your back. you're not a big fan of playing indoors. would i be right in thinking the match with rosol two years ago was the only other time you played under the roof?
does it change the conditions for you?
after the three matches now, how do you feel on grass?
you took a toilet break after the first set. was that to use the bathroom, to change clothes, to get reset perhaps?
wimbledon is a very special tournament. what do you like most about wimbledon?
if nick kyrgios gets through, he'll be your next opponent. this will be a pretty big story in australia. what do you know about him and what would you expect about playing him in the fourth round potentially?
there's a lot of rain today. a lot of matches not being played. how important is it for you that you did get to play, that you're finished, that you're through into the next round when maybe your opponent and other players won't be?
on a bit of a side note, wimbledon have installed a gate into the players box in centre court to stop people from climbing over the roof. in 2008 you did that. do you think it's disappointing we might lose an unofficial wimbledon tradition?
they're going to try to stop them. they have to go up and around and through the gate. after pat cash did it in 1978, it's almost an unofficial tradition.
do you think they should be allowed to do that then?
some of the players who are trying to make it to the finals, win majors for the first time, have talked about how they admire the big four. what do you think the four of you have in common that you would most like these younger players to learn from?
how about off the court in terms of sportsmanship and other qualities?
can you talk about your excitement about playing rafa?
what do you have to do well against him?
what were your thoughts on today's match, how that transpired? seemed like it was in two halves really, before the rain and after.
you had obviously the sort of emotion and match points that you saved against gasquet, was it tough at all to refocus and come back and play another match? how did you handle that?
you seemed to grab at your leg. everything okay?
how are you feeling physically versus mentally tired?
can you say something about the crowd? a lot of them slept overnight to get into position to watch you today.
last week, you're targeting up to 100 ranking by the end of the year. it's taken you a week. have you revised your goals?
if someone said to you start of the week you would be in the fourth round playing rafa, what would your response have been?
you had your headphones when you walk on court. what are you listening to?
what specifically was it today?
playing rafa is obviously probably the most physical challenge in tennis. how do you think you will handle that on the back of all the matches you have had already?
five pounds for every ace you his is going to the rally for bally. how did that come about?
is this the sort of situation and match you've always dreamed of, nadal and one of the big courts at wimbledon?
obviously you're familiar with his game. will you talk to him about how you should play him?
did you know bally at all, nick? why did you want to raise money for the cause?
what sense are you getting of the excitement at home about your performances this week?
is there any chance your mom and brother might come over now that you're through to the second week?
you can go out there and essentially you have nothing to lose, or would you think you would you take a bit of pride in the scoreline? how will you approach it?
nadal has been dropping a few sets recently. does that kind of give you hope you obviously can win?
i'm sure it will be probably on centre, or no.1, both big courts. we saw in melbourne how you love playing up to the big crowd. how do you think can you use that to help you?
do you believe you can beat him?
after last year you must be pleased with the troublefree program for the first week?
some of the younger players who have been trying to attain what you and the other three and the big four have, have spoken about learning a lot from the way you have carried yourselves on court and off. what would you most like that group to learn from the four of you?
what has your group's longevity at the top shown?
(question about a doublehanded backhand.)
when you were younger, you played twohanded?
what rituals or superstitions do you have that mean the most to you around your game?
what will you do with your day off tomorrow?
you mentioned about your new racquet in your previous interview. are you still testing the racquet or you are 100% happy with the new racquet?
given the weather today, how much of an advantage was it to know you would get your match out of the way? how much of a disadvantage might it be if you had to wait until tuesday or wednesday?
i can only assume you kept us waiting so long because you've been healing the rift with your brother.
probably for a few years.
how would you assess your first week?
did you get a chance to speak to ricky gervais?
is he a big tennis fan?
in your life you travel around the world, meet wonderful people. for you basically what is it like? what is the best part of being andy murray?
the place you'd like to go that you haven't gone to yet?
you're the only brit through to the second week in the singles. yesterday heather watson said she could understand some accusation that some of the british players are a little bit spoiled with the facilities and treatment they get, haven't put it in on the practice courts. what is your take on those accusations?
after the surgery last september, is this about the absolute best you could feel the way things worked out this year?
do you think this is the best first week you've had at wimbledon?
you haven't been on court very long.
what do you make of your next match?
tomas berdych and marin just finished their match.
they couldn't play with hawkeye for the last few games. do you think it's fair that a game should continue if technology can't actually work in the dark?
you seem to have a different aura here, maybe calmer. do you feel different here? is it the surface, the atmosphere, just being at wimbledon?
in america we talk about how agassi evolved from being a bratty young guy into a really thoughtful, giving guy. your journey has been a little different. a lot of people talk about your growth over the years. people are talking about your command of things. talk about your own path. is it something you're aware of or something you feel good about?
what did you think the chances were of a press conference without amlie?
that's not a question.
how do you prepare to face somebody as tall as anderson?
how did you feel out there today? how would you rate your performance?
you have quite a good record here. how deep do you feel you can go this year?
what's your history with him?
how do you combat a player who serves like an animal?
what is it like to play a guy that gets on big rolls then is streaky sometimes?
as you look back now, do you see the chance at the start of the fifth, do you see that as the pivotal part of the match?
you gave a wave to the crowd at the end of the match. standard wave? it wasn't a wave goodbye for good?
does that make you try to appreciate the moments like today a bit more?
talking about your fitness and your health, it's good now. are you looking forward?
is your mind when you get that close to someone who is top 20, does it give you the belief it's still worth keeping playing because you're so close?
considering nick's match, if and when you do go, do you feel you're leaving australian tennis in good hands?
do you feel emotional when you do lose at a grand slam tournament because you know there's a possibility you won't be coming back 12 months on?
you talked about leaving australian tennis in good hands. it seems we have the same debate over here every year about british players coming through. from your experience, do you see it that way, that perhaps we should be producing more?
before you said you were playing for your own reasons. can you put into words what your reasons are for keeping going?
i believe you set a new record today for most fiveset matches in slams. are you proud of that accomplishment? what is it that makes you keep digging deep in those circumstances?
you said it's nice to be 19 and just kind of go for it. what has changed for you in matches since you were 19?
what are your plans between now and the u.s.? do you feel you need more tennis or less tennis?
the grass court season going an extra week next year...
with nick's success and a couple other young guys coming through, what is your sense where the davis cup team might be over the next 18 months?
does it give you confidence the way the younger guys are beginning to play?
two sets to one up. you were in a good position. what happened there?
why? what happened? what went wrong?
there is a feeling among some people that with two seeded players you should have been on a better court than 17.
there was a feeling you were maybe being punished for the previous round that you were put on that court. do you think that plays a part in it?
you basically ran to serve when you were 5love down in the fifth. can you tell me what was going on? you were very quick to go and serve at 5love down in the fifth. what was going through your mind at that point?
how would you sum up the time here overall? obviously you've had this fine and people are saying maybe with the quality of both of you today you should have been on potentially a show court. how would you view your experience overall?
i mean, obviously the fine has been confirmed.
fair enough. overall your experience at wimbledon?
would playing on a bigger court have helped in any way? would you be able to feed off a bigger crowd?
do you enjoy wimbledon? do you enjoy this tournament?
the rules?
in what respect? which rules?
doesn't sound like you've had a happy time here.
you haven't had a happy time?
are you repentant about this? do you think you would do it differently next time, or are you you?
how would you describe how you hurt your shoulder and its condition?
other than working with boris the next couple of days on your diving, how will this affect your regimen?
any issue with your footwear? last year there was a bit of a problem and you had to change the tread. is that something that's causing a problem on the grass?
you face jowilfried tsonga next. what do you fear most about his game?
how did it feel when you feared your shoulder might be dislocated? your wimbledon could have been over.
the immediate feeling must be relief?
that would be the worst way to go out of a tournament, wouldn't it?
a couple of the younger players who have been trying to break into the top four, to make it to finals and win majors the way you and the other three guys in the top four have, have said they've learned a lot from the way you four conduct yourself. what would you most want them to learn from the way you four as a group have conducted yourself on and off the court?
you famously celebrate your victory by eating the grass. some climb into the player's box. this year wimbledon is encouraging players not to climb up on the roof if they win. should players be free to celebrate as they wish?
compare with this time last year. your opening round was entirely straightforward.
what about players who need to move to the next level? one of our own players, heather watson, has suggested that some of our british players are mollycoddled or perhaps lazy. from where you have battled through in serbia, do you see it that way? because of the facilities, the lta gives them so much money, do you think the english players have it a little bit easier?
over the past months you've been a little reluctant to share all the tips and suggestions that boris has made. he's the best diver in the history of this game. could you reveal what he's told you already or what you anticipate him telling you about the dive?
you feel it's helping you and you're trending in the right direction?
it all seemed to change on that backhand that hit the baseline to take you to 54.
were you surprised how quickly the final set went? i think he won seven points.
is this where all the hard work on and off the court really pays off?
from the outside looking in, you seem to actually quite relish it turning into a little bit of a scrap out there. i'm wondering where that fighting spirit comes from in you.
in terms of your background, as a child growing up, have you always had that kind of character?
it might be a little bit surprising to some people because obviously as a player you're quite known for your elegance, the beauty of your shotmaking. it's nice to see the scrappy fighting elements.
last year you had a heartbreaking loss in five sets here. now you're stronger. did it help you that you had that tough experience last year? did you think about it today?
i'm sure you knew part of what you were letting yourself in for when you brought roger onboard. has it been tougher work than you expected?
respectfully you're a player with a number of nicknames. some people call you baby fed. some call you mr. sharapova now.
do you feel a bit like with this run now, you can make your own name?
mayer up next. is that a surprise?
what is your record against him?
how do you want to be regarded? does that come back to the fighting spirit you showed today? is that the way you would like people to see you?
you said you wanted to make changes at the us open because you weren't happy with your fitness. do you still consider yourself a work in progress?
millions of bulgarians are following your matches with excitement. do you ever think about the fans back home when you play?
how often do you go back to bulgaria? you're almost in a different world now to what you grew up in.
at least once a year?
how are you going to celebrate today's victory?
most of the top players name raonic and you as the next generation. do you feel proud or do you feel pressure for that?
congratulations.
obviously it was quite dark out there. just wondering, what were your thoughts in the last few games? did you want to continue?
you came back very strong after the time you took off from the tour. you were moving really well. everything seems to be clicking in for you. you have played wonderful matches here. are you a different player right now?
from the four slams, do you think wimbledon is the one with your type of game that is the one you should do better in? you're very strong here.
i was talking to your coach, and he was telling me that he feels you can go to the final here. he says that you need to believe that even if you're not playing your best, you can still win matches. do you agree? do you think this is one of the things that can make you make that extra push? what other things do you need to work on?
also tomas, he was playing very well the entire match. high quality. a lot of pressure. in the past, you know, i've seen in matches that, you know, you let it go. lately like you hang in there. you were strong mentally there. is that something new that gives you more confidence? he was a finalist. does it give you a lot of confidence?
this was the latest finish ever in the history of wimbledon on the outside courts. how was it possible to extend?
do you mind walking us through just the conversation you had? did you try and tell them you don't want to play? because it's not always clear to see it on tv.
there is no consistency there, is there? if you go through a certain amount of the match using the hawkeye and then it changes, is that something that frustrated you then?
do you think when it's too dark to play, you know, and use hawkeye that they should suspend play at the same time?
can you follow this up? would you try to speak to anyone officially?
i suppose no one minds losing if you're beaten by somebody who plays better than you and they deserve it. is it frustrating that this clouds it aside from that? like you say, he played very well, and it would be one thing if that was the only thing people were talking about. but, obviously there is these other issues, as well.
what didn't work for you today tenniswise? what did you chalk it up to?
pretty solid start. what happened then in the third set?
it seemed like you had something maybe with your back. something bothering you?
the first time in five years you've made it to the third round. you must be pretty excited about it.
any particular reason what made it tougher for you to play on grass in the past?
have you ever talked to roger about playing on grass? he knows a thing or two about it.
will you watch his match at all now?
i would like to ask you something about the world cup. switzerland will be the next opponent of argentina, and messi.
what is your opinion about him?
you mentioned the last match against istomin here. it's been a while since then. is there something you can take from that match?
is it useful for your progress in the tournament to have had a real test today rather than sailing through in straight sets?
how did you feel? what did you think was the turning point of the match? you were playing great in the second set. some point even the set and then come the tiebreaker.
having been in the same exact spot two years ago and getting a different result, as you went out there today, did you have a lot of positive feelings?
seemed that even by his standards the pace was kind of especially when he was struggling the pace was really slow. did this ever bother you or get into your head at all?
you said he changed his tactics. what do you feel from your side changed about the way he was playing?
but did you...
apart from the disappointing result, i mean, the fact that you pretty much gave him all he could handle on the centre court wimbledon two years after beating him, does that encourage you as you go forward?
do you find some positives even with the result today in how you fought against him?
seemed right from the getgo, simple to say, you were better than him?
so this is your best showing at wimbledon to date. how does that make you feel?
do you feel that grass is not a natural surface for you? i mean, if you had to teach yourself to play on it. if so, are you now feeling that you're now comfortable?
what's it been like for you as a young player to see the domination of the big four, where it's so hard to break through at the majors? they've won all but two majors for nine years. what have you learned, and how has that affected your approach to the game?
what are some of the specific things you would point to? you mentioned it's not just what they do on tv but you see other things. what are some of the other things?
is court 3 just another court to you now? any bad lingering memories? is everything gone now? just another place to compete?
did you feel more mature than him today? he got frustrated early and showed it, whereas obviously you were doing well from the beginning. he seemed a little bit temperamental.
seems like canadian tennis has really come on in the last three or four years. what's behind that? what's been happening?
i have one last slightly ridiculous question. it's about the pronunciation of your name.
both. so the question i was going to ask, does that bug you when your hear your name pronounced incorrectly?
can you tell us how it's exactly pronounces?
does it make you want to grab the microphone and say, this is how you say my name?
did you hear milos in the crowd today?
no, it was a guy to the right of your chair.
kubot or lajovic in the next round. i am not sure. i didn't see if they finished.
and kubot?
ever played him or practiced with him?
obviously it's going to be a tough one to swallow. you had a match point which he played a good point on yesterday. you were playing pretty inspired bull tennis yesterday, and then you had to sit on it again another night, both of you. just talk about the whole experience.
it was getting dark and you guys decided you wanted to play on a little bit more. that was kind of unusual?
did you push to do that last night, or was that it at 99?
happens a lot here where you get matches that go to the next day, even though there is no rain. so they need to start earlier?
despite the disappointment here, do you feel like you started to feel yourself in this tournament and in this grass stretch?
getting a few matches under your belt like that reignite the motivation?
so back to l.a.?
and what's your first tournament?
in vegas with buddies. what's that? playing cards?
it sounds ridiculous to say, but when you get broken in the 25th game, what are you telling yourself? how did you fight against feeling the normal amount of deflation and try to keep yourself in that thing?
a long time earlier.
that seemed like a pretty flawless performance for you today. is that how you would see the match?
i heard that john mcenroe made a suggestion. maybe you already heard about that. he's thinking about tennis without referees. what do you think of this suggestion?
is that something you can imagine?
you've had most of your success in your career on hard courts. how does grass feel for you? do you feel comfortable on this surface and you're improving?
are you feeling very motivated? you've made the third round a few times now and never passed that. is that a big motivation for you to improve?
you came through in the end.
what were the biggest differences, besides the result, from the last time you played him here until now?
you talked about the game at 43. there was a huge celebration on the second point in that game. can something like that help get rid of tension?
is there any way you can prepare differently to face an opponent like rosol? can you do anything different to prepare for a match like that or do you react to the way he's playing?
when you're a set down and you get broken in the second, do you think back to 2012 at that point?
how much confidence does that give you now, playing as well as you did? how much confidence do you have going forward?
it looks like the rain is coming. if it does go indoors the next couple days, do you have to change anything the way you play?
how easy do you find it to switch off between matches? any particular places you like to go out to eat when you're here at wimbledon? anything you particularly like to do?
was there a moment in that match today where you thought you could lose? if so, does that inspire you to come back?
rosol, how would you describe his game and why it's difficult for you?
do you feel that it's actually been a while coming? you made such rapid strides in the game.
what's the bigger achievement, coming from two sets to love down or nine match points saved?
what were you thinking while you were facing each one of these match points?
the australian fans were very vocal in the front row. does that help or can it be distracting at times?
that was one of those really closecall challenges. what was your feeling that you saw that the technology could keep you in the match?
you seem to love the big stage. where does that come from? have you always been like that?
geoff masters said to you afterwards it was a careerdefining match for you. is that overstating things or do you feel that way?
gasquet said to us afterwards that he saw you as a future topfive player, potential grand slam winner. what are your own goals? how far do you think you're going to go?
you were standing between changeovers. is that something you always do?
talk about vesely, the next opponent.
you go after your matches and write down your thoughts and send them out to the world on your blog. what might the introduction to the story be tonight?
could you perhaps give us a sense of how the words might fall?
how are you feeling physically?
the australian open second round, that fifth set, first fiveset match, what have you been doing to increase your strength?
anything specific you're doing? running, weights?
how do you think you'll pull up in two days?
australia has had a long wait for a grand slam winner since hewitt here. are you feeling that pressure from your country? tomic was hotly tipped but has been surrounded in controversy during his career. is that a cautionary tale for you?
across many years australian men have always had great results here and love the grass. do you get a sense that wimbledon has a special magic for australians? what does it mean to you to play here?
can you describe a bit about your background. is it greek ancestry you have? how did you get into tennis?
what made you stick with it?
might i ask what your parents do for jobs? is it correct you played basketball for australia, as well?
how big are you going to be in canberra?
talk about the goal of getting to the very top. do you have a time scale in mind?
you've played a lot of tiebreaks. do you get excited when the numbers get big, that you might be near a record?
straight sets again.
is that a new feeling?
you're also the last american in singles.
you spoke a moment ago about tiebreakers. how would you describe the evolution of your approach to tiebreakers and what does the experience do for you when you face such a situation now?
you said 'for some reason.' do you have any ideas as to why that is?
in a match like today where your service games are going smoothly for you, how does that affect your play, your mindset? does it free you up a little on the return side?
can you tell me about the weird knee stuff you have on.
you mentioned this year has been a lot more routine as far as the major names getting through. was it the wednesday that you also went out?
it's been a reversal here.
do you think the grass is any better or different?
since we don't know who your opponent is, if you play lpez, describe the keys to that matchup.
would you consider or could you see yourself having a female coach?
so why not?
i think the best you ever played here was at the olympics.
grass got worn out more quickly that year. what was it about those conditions that worked that you haven't had at this main event?
do you think something clicked during the olympics at all?
when you're here, do you check out your plaque?
do you stop and give it a little rub?
this is as far as you've got. do you like wimbledon?
what is the feeling? you said something about the feeling at the olympics was a bit different.
wimbledon is thinking of giving yaroslava shvedova an honorary plaque. would you support a plaque for her for her golden set?
did you watch the soccer?
do you want to know?
clearly you like playing at wimbledon.
and last year's results?
but can you kick on this time?
could you compare this match that you did last year against federer? are there some similar aspects?
what do you particularly like in this tournament? the surface? the atmosphere?
gulbis said that the slazenger balls are a bit hard to get spin on. did you find that?
he said he hit it flatter.
is it difficult to play someone you like?
you said you had learned from what happened last year after the federer match. what is it that you have learned that you hope to carry forward now?
you handle them very well.
that was a big problem?
was there a letdown? is that what it was?
you're trying to avoid that now?
i know you've been on the atp council.
congratulations.
what are your thoughts on the next challenges for the atp?
you spoke about equal prize money before. is that something you still think is a possibility or something you've given up on?
that was the first time here i think yesterday or two days ago where they had two women's matches on centre and court 1. usually the other way around. do you think the men should get scheduling preference?
have you had a chance to talk it chris kermode at all?
anything you can tell us?
any particular issues you brought up?
who would you prefer for the president of the board now that roger is...
when look back to last year, what is the difference between you last year and you this year?
do you think you can handle the second week here?
roger said this yesterday, that he's coming to the net more, that some players aren't doing that now. that's the fundamental bedrock of your game. do you sense there is a bit of that on tour, the attritional tennis that we've been used to might be changing?
you won a number of smaller tournaments, and a lot of players, some players...
smaller than wimbledon.
why do you think it's been difficult to translate that success to bigger tournaments?
i know it's a long way to go, but will you play davis cup against belgium?
seems to be an issue if the tie will take place in ukraine. do you know anything about that?
because itf is negotiating with the belgian federation if they're going to play in belgium.
can you spoken to wladimir klitschko about the situation?
not necessarily, no. just wondered if you had.
the duchess of cornwell left centre court today so she could come and watch you. how pleased are you with that?
yes.
you threw your bands into the crowd at the end of the match, very close to the duchess. i assume you weren't aiming for her?
how hard was it to sort of keep focused in the present? it was all going so well for you.
i know you've only been working with amlie for a short time. how much of an impact has she been able to have already on what you're doing on court?
following on from what you said about the french open, would you always prefer to win matches pretty quickly like that? for example, last year, the match against verdasco, did that help you in the latter two matches?
last year i remember you training in between some of your matches with kyle edmund. i was wondering if that might be anything you were doing this year and how you assess his progress?
i appreciate what you say about how it might be early for amlie to change things on the court. can you talk about the chemistry so far.
you showed a lot of variety out there today. amlie had that in her game. is that something you thought about when you hired her and something you want to work on in your game?
what are your thoughts and hopes about the next move for lebron james after him opting out of his miami heat contract?
your thoughts on aljaz bedene becoming a british player? would you welcome him in the davis cup team?
that was your most economical match in terms of time and games. when you're hammering somebody like that, is there a moment where you feel sympathy for him or is it relentless pressure to get on and off the court?
you mentioned season tickets for the miami heat. season tickets at hibs? what do you make of alan stubbs' appointment as manager? were you happy with that?
is there much difference, andy, playing on centre to 1, how the two courts are playing? do you accept the fact you have to have at least one outing off of centre court?
do you have any preference then if there's a difference now?
regarding junior wimbledon, do you think back to those old days and how important they were to developing into the player you are now?
as a football fan, what did you make of suarez last night?
what do you make of bautista agut? have you practiced with him before?
you played pretty much all your matches here over the last many years either on centre court or court1. usually in the first week there's two men's matches and one women's match. what do you think of the of the system of spreading it out?
your mother's version this morning of the rescue, she found it quite harrowing. what did she say to you afterwards?
she said she saw you jump out of the car in the middle of traffic.
can you tell the whole story for those of us who haven't had it in your words?
was the owner surprised that it was andy murray?
i know you know him quite well and i'm sure you were expecting him to be serving well. you barely had any looks at his serve. what was making it tough today?
because you had such a great run in paris, was it harder for you to adjust to the grass? did you feel you didn't have as much time as you wanted to prepare?
with your serve, do you feel that grass should be a surface that you're comfortable with?
how important was it at 3all in the second set? it was obviously a game you survived a lot of breakpoints and then the two doublefaults at the end. from the outside you appeared to get quite angry after that. it took you a while to get back in your groove.
how would you describe the response to the umpire/vampire comments?
what have you heard from people?
this spring you've had quite a run in france: gambling, vampires, an early loss here.
you gambled your winnings...
you didn't gamble your winnings at the blackjack tables in latvia?
i still have a question to ask.
that's interesting, because you're saying you lost a little bit of money at the blackjack tables. thank you. but do you prefer a season where there are ups, downs, these great runs, or do you prefer the old days when it was more steady and not much attention? have you enjoyed this run this spring on the tennis circuit?
i was wondering if you rather want to get back to clay tournaments or like disconnect a little bit from tennis and get back to latvia and disconnect?
was your back bothering you today?
from your perspective, what is it like to try to break through the big four's dominance the way wawrinka did at australia, del potro did, but nobody else in the last nine years?
i meant trying to break through against the top four at majors. what is it like for all the other guys given their dominance over these last nine years?
victoria azarenka said on monday you and her talk about fine art.
on the same night?
do you have your own art collection?
any particular artist?
your matches are always keenly anticipated. some of the best commentators on tennis always say that you have enormous talent and could go very far in the draw.
they say though that the one thing they worry about is your temper. what is your reply to that?
can i ask if you've been told by the itf what your fine is for the outburst on monday?
your fines for the...
what were your disputes in the first match? there was a little bit with the supervisor today, but in the first match you were getting very animated and saying you were going to break racquets.
okay. the supervisor was...
today's match the supervisor was there before the first point. do you think it's fair to expect trouble from you?
you started well, and then it suddenly turned into a very tough match. it got complicated for you, didn't it?
matches like this, two, three, four years down the line, do you remember them? do they blur after a while?
you said after the first round you didn't really have a chance to assess your game at this point. after this match how do you assess your game?
obviously he's an entertaining player. i've been talking to some players about it. some players are too vocal. monfils yesterday was talking the whole time through the match. there's a thin line. what do you think that line is that players can cross or not cross in terms of distracting the opponent?
speaking of gamesmanship, i don't think it happened tonight, but bathroom breaks. obviously a famous one happened a couple years ago at the us open with andy murray. it's a trend of the last few years. do you still see it a lot and what are your feelings as using it as a timeout?
sounds like a strange question, i don't know if you've done it yourself, but is there anybody watching you?
did the amount of challenges that radek made, the first point of the game, annoy you at all?
did you concede a point to him?
why?
convincing win. what were your feelings out there?
do you feel you're playing particularly well this year?
you may not know, but when boris becker won queen's, he was almost unknown, he won wimbledon a few weeks later. he was paid 161 by the bookmakers, exactly like you. is that a good omen?
how much of an influence has your coach been? he works you very hard, doesn't he?
what does he put you through?
it's some years since you won the junior title here. does that experience help you now?
being you're so lucky to share your company with maria sharapova, how different is the preparation and the work you say you have to do compared to the work that she has to do? is it completely different, two different stories?
from the point of view of work.
what have you learned from the type of competitor and worker she is?
for nine years there's been a virtual roadblock to major championships with four guys. what is it like for a guy trying to break in and join that group?
another question about maria. would you two sort of see each other much over the course of the fortnight or do you go into some kind of isolation?
with you two, do you make a conscious effort to see each other while you're both competing or is it better to stay apart?
you have to play dolgopolov next round. you both are very talented. when you have to play a player who is very talented, do you fear him more than someone who is more consistent, that is always playing at his level, or not? does it create new problems to you?
you said before about being honored to play on centre court. besides the prestige of wimbledon, is there particularly anything special about the tournament? what gives you sort of goosebumps when you come here?
the british fans are pretty excited about andy murray. you could be facing him in the quarterfinals. can you allow yourself to look that far ahead?
would it be an exciting challenge for you?
speaking of andy murray, we were speaking a moment ago about the big four. when you think about that group and the way they've played, what do you learn from them and appreciate most?
what does it say about the four of them that they've had such control of the men's tour for so long?
i remember stoichkov and kostadinova as the most famous bulgarian athletes. who is the one who is most famous apart from you? one or two names that are the top stars? are you the number one or not?
are there champions in other fields? dimitar berbatov?
back to the coaching style, there's been a lot said about how influential he's been and that you had a lot of talent for a long time, but this year you seem to be moving, and he is the main inspiration for that.
how did the linkup with roger come about? was it your agent's suggestion? had you seen him? did you know him?
because of your relationship with maria, what was your reaction when murray decided to have as a coach amlie mauresmo, who is a lady? did it shock you at all? you said before that you have different preparation, women's tennis is something, men's tennis is something else.
you talk about the mental strength, mental toughness. how does a coach help you hone that?
you were talking briefly at the end about your wrist. could you explain the problem?
were you in much pain as you played? it was a very brutal match, wasn't it?
towards the end of the third set you called for medical advice or assistance. did you take tablets or something?
seemed to do you good because you ran away with the match after that, didn't you?
you had a similar match with him last year in the fourth round here. were you expecting another tough one, or did you think, since he's 86 in the world now, it would be easier?
you play andy next. you've been training with him on the clay in valencia. tell us about that and your relationship with andy.
did you know andy when he was in spain or not?
your game seems to be wellsuited to grass as well as clay. you won in holland before here. have you adjusted your style of tennis to cope with the grass?
you've had some excellent results this year and made a big climb in the rankings. what has been the difference for you?
you play very well on clay. that's probably your best surface. are you surprised your first title came on grass?
you played a big occasion by winning in holland. this will be a big occasion. do you think you're a big occasion player?
the crowd will be very much for him.
how important was the win over del potro in australia for you?
with all that confidence, do you go in with no fear playing andy next?
when you've practiced with andy, who came out on top?
am i right in saying that you played for villarreal when you were younger?
why did you stop?
might you have been a professional footballer?
was that a hard decision?
what was the main reason you chose tennis?
are all the spanish players pretty close friends?
what areas of your game do you see as strengths that you might be able to test andy?
for people who don't necessarily know your game, how would you describe your game, the strong points?
were you especially pleased the way you contended in the first set? probably look back at one or two of those chances you had at 3all and think, if i would've taken those then it could've been a little bit of a different story.
what's that like facing his serve?
as an experience, is it something you can use?
where are you from, dan? manchester?
is that sort of bolton?
you were playing tennis way above your ranking in the first set. have you ever played that level before, and do you think you can now start playing that level consistently?
where does life take you in the next few weeks?
you obviously made an awful a lot of progress this year resultswise. going to nottingham clearly, as we said, has been a huge thing for you. where do you think you next need to take your game?
how do you sort of describe the differences between the tournaments you usually play at and suddenly you turn up here and the comfort levels, you know, everything surrounding it?
when people watch on the tv, they see the first round of wimbledon and that's the first thing they see of the tournament. obviously completely different for people that have to fight to get there. talk to us about what it has taken for you to get this far.
financially, has it been a struggle being down in the 200 and 300's, and will being in the first round help you financially?
how come you've been coming here since seven? dad working here?
right. in that time, what are your sort of favorite wimbledon moments that you've seen on the other side of the fence?
as a seven year old seeing john isner, you probably would've thought you landed on a different planet. what's that like competing against him?
in terms of the financial side of things, obviously it's difficult for everyone. has there ever been a point where you have had to consider your future in the sport?
how old were you when you started putting your money into your tennis?
how difficult was it playing a much taller man and one with a very big serve?
you prefer other surfaces, you've never gone beyond the third round here. can you go better than that this time?
does the fact that you've not got past the third round here, does that give you extra desire to do better at wimbledon?
i'm not sure if you've seen the draw. you have a really good draw. your efforts against rafael nadal on clay, they are going to inspire you to good things on grass?
you play denis kudla in the next round. you haven't played him before. what do you do in the case to play an opponent you have not played?
can i ask you for your thoughts about yuichi sugita who got through the qualifiers after the 18th attempt.
how would you describe your transition to the grass this time around?
you had two early exits here the last two years. how much was that on your mind going into the match? how determined has that made you to succeed this time around?
you served well today. there was one serve where you hit the frame on breakpoint. was that the pressure of the breakpoint? i don't remember you doing that before.
when you went the first set down, did it creep into your mind what happened the last two years or did it make you more determined to get back into the game as quickly as possible?
that first set, you've given a few of your opponents a chance at dropping the first set, the semis at roland garros as well as the final, but you always come back winning three straight sets. does it spur you on or do you feel you're giving too much of a chance to your opponent early on?
next up rosol, of course. do you take many lessons from last year's match?
is winning backtoback french open and wimbledon titles the toughest beat in tennis, do you think? is that the hardest thing in the sport to do?
people say the grass at wimbledon is either too fast, too slow. does it really make any difference because everybody has to play on the surface no matter what?
next year we go one week later, which will give you more time to prepare. what would you like to do between roland garros and wimbledon with this extra week?
in the first game of the third set, there was a point where you slipped and you covered on the baseline both sides of the court and hit a winner, a passing shot. can you describe what was going through your mind and what you were feeling after the point?
what feeling did it give you?
i just have two english questions: your match today, just tell us how you felt and how it went.
last year you made the quarterfinals, if i'm correct. tell me what it's like to try to defend those points especially.
so you just keep that out of your head?
coming back to wimbledon after how well you did last yeah, how do you feel? excitement? pressure? what's the emotion coming back?
what were your thoughts on today's victory? you had some periods that were very impressive, and then devvarman was a very tough opponent. how would you analyze it?
a lot of your ranking right now is built on the semifinal of wimbledon last year. does that make you nervous at all?
no?
what are your thoughts on facing lleyton hewitt next?
what's been the toughest part of the last 12 months for you? obviously you had the big result here and not as strong the rest of the year and this year so far.
yeah.
how did you lose your skill on the battlefield?
what do you mean?
like a video game?
and now you're getting killed more often?
any specific video game that has stat?
oh, just battle field.
three sets, no breakers. that's got to feel good.
he was a wildcard. how did you feel about your own level in general? could you feel it out there?
john, what's your perspective on the domination of the big four, and how tough it is to get past those guys to win a major?
nine years, only del potro and wawrinka have broken through. what do you think you've learned from watching those four guys play? how does it affect your psyche going into a major?
not to beat a dead horse, but i'm going to flog it a little bit. four of the top seven americans have some college experience. can you talk about that for a minute? do you think that's a more viable path to the pros now?
do you think you're going to see guys look at that as an example in the years ahead and say, that could work for me?
you're an exception as someone that's been to college and in the top 10. do you think it's still the path for really top prospects, a straight jump to the pros or...
i would like to go back to what willie was talking about. you've seen these top players up close and personal. what quality of those top four really impresses you the most? we see how murray handles the british situation;rafa fighting for every point; roger, et cetera. what quality most impresses you?
going back to the college question, you emerged so successfully from college. with john whitlinger leaving stanford, one of the most important positions is open for a coach. what do you think is the most important quality for a college coach?
what does the world cup mean to you, and what are your thoughts on the usa's next game against germany?
on a slightly different tack we're already out. the young lad you played today has risen from 400 to 240 in the rankings this year. he's won futures. he's our most improved player. could you see the signs today of why that may have happened and what did you think of his contribution to the match today?
long way from there to where you are. what are the fundamentals that a youngish guy like that has to knuckle down, be there every day?
was there any piece of advice you got that resonated with you more than others from anyone in particular?
she didn't tell you anything in particular?
obviously a very tough second set. happy the way you went after that?
how did you feel out there fitnesswise?
what do you need to do against janowicz next match?
was it a patience game when you come up with someone like him? do you have to bide your time?
this is a very special place for you. is it days like this that keep you going?
there's seven australians into the second round, the most since '99. thoughts on that?
what do you think of someone like nick kyrgios going through?
there's a bit of conjecture around it might be your last time at wimbledon. are you approaching this in any way like it could be your last or not?
looked pretty straightforward. is that how it felt?
you said you tried to come forward a bit more. how much more difficult is that now on these courts compared to when you were first coming along?
how did you feel starting on no.1?
is it easy to get frustrated with coming to the net and stop doing it?
as an overall picture, is that something that stefan has helped you with?
have you got your little boys over with you? is it noisy?
lleyton was just in here. he travels with quite a clan, too. what gives you the most joy out of fatherhood?
do you tend to be on the strict side or freeform?
are they aware of what you do?
does it keep you grounded? because to them you're just dad.
you talked about volleying more in the early days here, then not doing it as much because the game changed. what has made you go back to that way of playing now? do you think it's a viable way of actually winning a title these days?
what has been the hardest part of readjusting to that game for you?
going back to the serve and volley.
to what extent do you think the extra week next year on grass is going to make younger players think, i can concentrate on this surface and learn to play on grass?
tough one today. excellent opponent. how did you feel it went?
seemed like you could live with him for the first six or seven strokes of a rally, and then he seemed to always have the answer.
is it disappointing after your performance at the french open?
anything in particular about your game that you thought was improved today?
do you find it a painful experience looking through the tape?
is it more difficult losing here than, say, in davis cup?
obviously the firstround prize money has risen. much has been made of that. i guess it doesn't mean anything, does it? you're only here to win?
the lta said one of the reasons is to try to keep people in the sport effectively. do you think it will help that happen? do you think that's a fair reflection of the situation?
what next then?
there's a chap who lost on court 16 who expressed an interest in becoming british, if i can use that phrase. it happens in other sports where people end up playing for either england or great britain. what is your view on that happening in tennis?
considering he could ultimately be vying with you for a place on the davis cup team, it must surely be something you have an opinion on.
been a few changes at the top with the structure of the lta. bob brett has been brought onboard. what are your thoughts about the changes there?
people want to see greater results and improvements. has there been a general sort of underachievement at the top level for britain?
you seemed to find your rhythm quickly today. you would be really happy with that win.
how do you do homework on a guy you don't know a lot about? what sort of things do you need to do?
what do you need to do better to beat tomas?
lost to him last year here. what lesson do you take from that defeat?
is that a really difficult step up in class, to go from someone like evgeny today sort of ranked around 100 to one of the really top players in the game?
you had a difficult year in terms of injuries, but looked like up you were doing it really easy out there today. how is the body after all the rigamarole?
does the time away from tennis when you were rehabilitating, does that give you a different perspective on the game than when you're just going week to week?
does it make you appreciate the opportunities you still have and give you a sense of urgency about what you need to achieve still?
so you're enjoying being a tennis player this year as much as you have in the past, or has it made it difficult with the stuff you've dealt with this year?
when you come to a tournament like this where you have points to defend, do you feel nervous or excited?
given what you had this year with the surgeries, do you get a sense that stamina and fitness will come into this if this goes anywhere near the distance against someone strong like tomas?
what did you feel you did well today in your game?
you're aware in the next round is a rather large figure potentially awaiting you.
you'll be on one of the show courts obviously. this is only your second grand slam.
are you someone who thrives on being the underdog?
andy is the leading british player. underneath him we don't seem to have many guys even of the caliber of yourself to make it through to the second round. as someone that plays on the circuit, is that something that is noticeable, the lack of depth in british tennis?
in the past did you work with ty tucker?
could you talk about him as a coach?
in my country there's the big coaching position open at stanford. do you think he would do a good job there?
you mentioned you don't have anyone of andy's caliber in your country. you have aljaz bedene. he's obviously looking to change over to britain. how would that affect you? what do you think about that?
presumably you always wanted to make it as a pro. why did you go to university in the states?
what chance do you think you have of beating andy murray?
if you beat him, how big a shock would it be?
how much experience have you had on grass courts?
a couple of british opponents as well?
in your career what's the match where you felt the most tension, individual match, playing michigan?
was your ncaa play in athens?
what do you think could prepare you for centre court?
what are your emotions at this moment?
will you embrace that at all?
how was that, marinko?
you promised you would play attackingly and you did. must have been pleasing that you could follow through.
you seem obviously very measured, quite low key. is it having got this initial win out of the way and you're kind of now focused on just winning more?
the win in france.
was it just particularly draining out there?
just was it particularly draining out there?
couple of niggles at queen's, injury niggles. back to full fitness now?
must be pleased that that's all done with.
basically the same question. you finished strongly in the fourth set, 62. obviously feeling well and had plenty in the tank at the finish?
did you have plenty in the tank by the time you got to the fourth set?
two hours sixteen.
can you gain a lot of confidence from this, another seed you knocked out?
what are you are thoughts on the second round? looking like chardy.
are you all right at the moment? seem a bit flat.
is that usual after a match like that?
were you anxious last night?
can you compare this win with the one in france?
how important is mark's influence, especially on grass?
the fans were bringing out the mad dog again. do you mind so much this time?
initially you didn't sort of warm to that nickname. has that changed now, or your just happy to take the support?
robin, just want to ask how much attention you're paying to the world cup while you're here?
nothing?
okay.
i notice on the court you talk to your coach quite a lot. i wonder how important he's been over the last years improving your form.
off the court, what sort of things does he help you with?
when you're training.
is he doing anything that a woman couldn't do?
could a woman be your coach?
all i'm trying to say is basically are there any things in men's tennis that women couldn't do as coaches?
i don't know if you heard john mcenroe's comments. he would like to get rid of umpires and have players call their own shots. have you any thoughts of that?
have players call their own shots.
you would agree?
how would it work? why?
why do you agree?
you think the majority of players would be able to work in that kind of system, in all honesty say, okay, it was in or out?
yes.
yes, i understand. so you are disagreeing with mcenroe?
what did you say about vampires?
the media, are they the vampires?
you couldn't have started off any quicker than you did. that was dream tennis for the first two sets.
because of the history, a lot has been written about andy's 2013 final, not so much about yours. you arguably didn't play your best tennis. did you want to remind centre court what you can do today?
but the way you played today suggested...
how difficult was it for you, knowing that you didn't have any competitive games on grass before the tournament?
when you come to wimbledon, is it more a matter of this is the world's biggest tournament, i have to focus on my matches, or is there a sense that this is the place i dreamed of when i was a kid?
do you feel mentally you're over that final in roland garros?
your opponent today lost his last 10 grass court matches in a row. your next opponent is very aggressive on grass. he's made it hard for a lot of top players this season.
andy obviously did something pretty bold in the hiring of his new coach. your first coach was jelena. she was also kind of a life coach, introduced you to classical music, so forth. do you think that she was a woman who in any way helped you start in your path?
of all the people and the coaches that have touched your career, who has given you the most important piece of advice as a tennis player and what was it?
people in your life, coaches in your life.
you've had a lot of success in uae. how much are you looking forward to representing the new league? now would you consider having your offseason in dubai?
how did that feel today?
how are you generally feeling about your form? must be pretty confident.
andy has won. novak has won. when you have guys in the higher seeds doing that, do you think sometimes that can open up the competition for you a bit further down the seedings?
did winning queen's change your preparations or expectations for wimbledon?
before october last year you hadn't won a title. now you have four on four different surfaces and made quarterfinals in australia. what has been the main difference?
what do you think in particular is special about your relationship with roger? what is he helping you with now that maybe you didn't get in the past?
you said you learned something about yourself. what have you learned?
your backhand, did you always play single handed?
did your coach teach you that way?
you never struggled with power when you were smaller?
how much do you know about your opponent in the second round?
how do you prepare for a match when you don't know that much about your opponent? just focus on yourself?
there's quite a few people who think you might be able to go quite a long way into the tournament. how does that make you feel?
how tough was that today? was it tough as you expected?
chaps like yourself and james ward, you fight tenaciously to reach the standards of andy murray. can you explain sort of to the onceayear visitors to wimbledon just how difficult it is to raise your game or be in front of the home crowd?
does andy murray's success, particularly last year, does that actually add a pressure to the rest of the british players?
your friends i think were pretty vocal on court today. did you notice them? were you aware? did that help?
there were seven breaks in the last set.
what do you put that down to?
how big a part do you think nerves played today for you?
do you wish it could have gone on a bit longer?
when you play as well as you did winning that set, can you explain to people how difficult it is to sustain that standard against a player of his experience?
there has been a lot of focus on the increased prize money and things like that, and i suppose tied into the changes the lta has made. i'm guessing from what you're saying it's absolutely hard earned, really.
is it a question of in some ways pouring over the books and making everything balance out?
what's your take then on this chap bedene from slovenia who wants to adopt britain, if you like, as his tennis nationality. other sports do it. is there any reason why it shouldn't happen in tennis?
you've known him then since you were 14. he's lived here a long time then?
you've seen a commitment to britain and i suppose everything that goes with it from him.
dan evans is the one that's been fairly vocal about it. he goes long along with what you are saying, the fact that he's not british is what he objects to.
so just to be clear then, if he's not breaking any rules, why should we have a problem with him? people who are outspoken or have a problem with it, their problem is really with the rules?
not related to this particular game, but have you got any thoughts on john mcenroe's comments about getting rid of umpires and letting players call their own shots? have you heard that?
do you think that that would be...
